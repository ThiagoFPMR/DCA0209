## Week 10
# Brazillian Air Traffic Analysis

**This is the first multi-week project for Algorithms and Data Strucutures II.**

The goal of the project is to analyze brazillian air traffic while making use of the graph algorithms taught so far in the class. The data used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/alvarofpp/dataset-flights-brazil).

The analysis will be divided into 4 parts: *assortativity analysis, bivariate analysis, trip simulation, and clustering anlysis.*

## Assortativity
