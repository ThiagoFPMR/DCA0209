# Week 1

This week consisted of a general introduction of python and git for those unfimiliar with them, which doubled as a review for those in the know.

The homework for the week consisted of completing 2 courses in the dataquest platform:

- **Git and Version Control** [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://www.dataquest.io/course/git-and-vcs/) ([Certificate Link](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/B71I8BM094T9YDRUQANO))
- **Python for Data Engineering: Fundamentals Part I** [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-fundamentals-de/) ([Certificate Link](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/B71I8BM094T9YDRUQANO))

The PDF certificates for the courses are within this folder. They also each contain a link that allows for verification, just in case.
