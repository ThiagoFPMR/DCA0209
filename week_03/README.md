# Week 3 

This week involved a review of data structures taught in **DCA0208** (namely linked lists, stacks and queues). A notebook containing 3 interview questions on the topic was given as homework in order to practice these concepts.

This folder contains a version of that notebook with the answers filled. The answers all passed the accompanying unit tests. As additional material, the solution to each question is briefly discussed [here](https://www.loom.com/share/fd1f11a191e84ade8510dc8d7bea88a3) in video format (the video is in portuguese).
