# **Task 4**

## **Task Objectives**

The objective of the assignment was to implement the following two functionalities to the **Inventory** class developed in *Dataquest.io's [Guided Project: Building Fast Queries on a CSV](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/481/guided-project%253A-building-fast-queries-on-a-csv/)*:

1. Given a range of prices, `min_price` and `max_price`, find all laptops whose price is in the given range. 
2. Find the cheapest laptop  that matches the some desired characteristics *(e.g. 8GB of RAM and 256 of storage)*.

Additionally, a complexity analysis was done on top of the new method implementations, in order to gauge their efficiency. For reference, the original **Inventory** class implementation can be found in `og_inventory.py`.
