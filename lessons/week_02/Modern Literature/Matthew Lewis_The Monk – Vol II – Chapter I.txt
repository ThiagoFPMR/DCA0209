and at length faint away a she be fall i catch her in my arm and place her upon a sopha then hasten to the door i summon her woman to her assistance i commit her to their care and seize the opportunity of escape agitated and confuse beyond expression i bend my step towards the garden the benignity with which the baroness have listen to me at first raise my hope to the high pitch i imagine her to have perceive my attachment for her niece and to approve of it extreme be my disappointment at understand the true purport of her discourse i know not what course to take the superstition of the parent of agnes aid by her aunt unfortunate passion seem to oppose such obstacle to our union a be almost insurmountable a i past by a low parlour whose window look into the garden through the door which stand half open i observe agnes seat at a table she be occupy in draw and several unfinished sketch be scattered round her i enter still undetermined whether i should acquaint her with the declaration of the baroness oh be it only you say she raise her head you be no stranger and i shall continue my occupation without ceremony take a chair and seat yourself by me i obey and place myself near the table unconscious what i be do and totally occupy by the scene which have just pass i take up some of the drawing and cast my eye over them one of the subject strike me from it singularity it represent the great hall of the castle of lindenberg a door conduct to a narrow staircase stand half open in the foreground appear a group of figure place in the most grotesque attitude terror be express upon every countenance here be one upon hi knee with hi eye cast up to heaven and pray most devoutly there another be creep away upon all fours some hide their face in their cloak or the lap of their companion some have conceal themselves beneath a table on which the remnant of a feast be visible while other with gaping mouth and eye widestretched point to a figure suppose to have create this disturbance it represent a female of more than human stature clothe in the habit of some religious order her face be veil on her arm hung a chaplet of bead her dress be in several place stain with the blood which trickle from a wound upon her bosom in one hand she hold a lamp in the other a large knife and she seem advance towards the iron gate of the hall what do this mean agnes say i be this some invention of your own she cast her eye upon the draw oh no she reply ti the invention of much wise head than mine but can you possibly have live at lindenberg for three whole month without hearing of the bleeding nun you be the first who ever mention the name to me pray who may the lady be that be more than i can pretend to tell you all my knowledge of her history come from an old tradition in this family which have be hand down from father to son and be firmly credit throughout the baron domains nay the baron believe it himself and a for my aunt who have a natural turn for the marvellous she would sooner doubt the veracity of the bible than of the bleeding nun shall i tell you this history i answer that she would oblige me much by relate it she resume her drawing and then proceed a follow in a tone of burlesque gravity it be surprising that in all the chronicle of past time this remarkable personage be never once mention fain would i recount to you her life but unluckily till after her death she be never know to have exist then first do she think it necessary to make some noise in the world and with that intention she make bold to seize upon the castle of lindenberg have a good taste she take up her abode in the best room of the house and once establish there she begin to amuse herself by knock about the table and chair in the middle of the night perhaps she be a bad sleeper but this i have never be able to ascertain accord to the tradition this entertainment commence about a century ago it be accompany with shriek howl groan swear and many other agreeable noise of the same kind but though one particular room be more especially honoured with her visit she do not entirely confine herself to it she occasionally venture into the old gallery pace up and down the spacious hall or sometimes stop at the door of the chamber she weep and wail there to the universal terror of the inhabitant in these nocturnal excursion she be see by different people who all describe her appearance a you behold it here trace by the hand of her unworthy historian the singularity of this account insensibly engage my attention did she never speak to those who meet her say i not she the specimen indeed which she give nightly of her talent for conversation be by no mean invite sometimes the castle rung with oath and execration a moment after she repeat her paternoster now she howl out the most horrible blasphemy and then chaunted de profundis as orderly a if still in the choir in short she seem a mighty capricious being but whether she pray or curse whether she be impious or devout she always contrive to terrify her auditor out of their sens the castle become scarcely habitable and it lord be so frighten by these midnight revel that one fine morning he be find dead in hi bed this success seem to please the nun mightily for now she make more noise than ever but the next baron prove too cunning for her he make hi appearance with a celebrate exorciser in hi hand who fear not to shut himself up for a night in the haunted chamber there it seem that he have an hard battle with the ghost before she would promise to be quiet she be obstinate but he be more so and at length she consent to let the inhabitant of the castle take a good night rest for some time after no news be heard of her but at the end of five year the exorciser die and then the nun venture to peep abroad again however she be now grown much more tractable and wellbehaved she walk about in silence and never make her appearance above once in five year this custom if you will believe the baron she still continue he be fully persuade that on the fifth of may of every fifth year as soon a the clock strike one the door of the haunted chamber open observe that this room have be shut up for near a century then out walk the ghostly nun with her lamp and dagger she descend the staircase of the eastern tower and cross the great hall on that night the porter always leave the gate of the castle open out of respect to the apparition not that this be think by any mean necessary since she could easily whip through the keyhole if she choose it but merely out of politeness and to prevent her from make her exit in a way so derogatory to the dignity of her ghostship and whither do she go on quit the castle to heaven i hope but if she do the place certainly be not to her taste for she always return after an hour absence the lady then retire to her chamber and be quiet for another five year and you believe this agnes how can you ask such a question no no alphonso i have too much reason to lament superstition influence to be it victim myself however i must not avow my incredulity to the baroness she entertain not a doubt of the truth of this history a to dame cunegonda my governess she protest that fifteen year ago she saw the spectre with her own eye she relate to me one even how she and several other domestic have be terrify while at supper by the appearance of the bleeding nun a the ghost be call in the castle ti from her account that i draw this sketch and you may be certain that cunegonda be not omit there she be i shall never forget what a passion she be in and how ugly she look while she scold me for have make her picture so like herself here she point to a burlesque figure of an old woman in an attitude of terror in spite of the melancholy which oppress me i could not help smile at the playful imagination of agnes she have perfectly preserve dame cunegondas resemblance but have so much exaggerated every fault and render every feature so irresistibly laughable that i could easily conceive the duenna anger the figure be admirable my dear agnes i know not that you possess such talent for the ridiculous stay a moment she reply i will show you a figure still more ridiculous than dame cunegondas if it please you you may dispose of it a seem best to yourself she rise and go to a cabinet at some little distance unlock a drawer she take out a small case which she open and present to me do you know the resemblance say she smile it be her own transport at the gift i press the portrait to my lip with passion i throw myself at her foot and declare my gratitude in the warm and most affectionate term she listen to me with complaisance and assure me that she share my sentiment when suddenly she utter a loud shriek disengage the hand which i hold and fly from the room by a door which open to the garden amazed at this abrupt departure i rise hastily from my knee i behold with confusion the baroness standing near me glow with jealousy and almost choaked with rage on recover from her swoon she have torture her imagination to discover her concealed rival no one appear to deserve her suspicion more than agnes she immediately hasten to find her niece tax her with encouraging my address and assure herself whether her conjecture be wellgrounded unfortunately she have already see enough to need no other confirmation she arrive at the door of the room at the precise moment when agnes give me her portrait she hear me profess an everlasting attachment to her rival and saw me kneel at her foot she advance to separate u we be too much occupy by each other to perceive her approach and be not aware of it till agnes beheld her standing by my side rage on the part of donna rodolpha embarrassment on mine for some time keep u both silent the lady recover herself first my suspicion then be just say she the coquetry of my niece have triumph and ti to her that i be sacrifice in one respect however i be fortunate i shall not be the only one who lament a disappointed passion you too shall know what it be to love without hope i daily expect order for restore agnes to her parent immediately upon her arrival in spain she will take the veil and place an insuperable barrier to your union you may spare your supplication she continue perceive me on the point of speak my resolution be fix and immoveable your mistress shall remain a close prisoner in her chamber till she exchange this castle for the cloister solitude will perhaps recall her to a sense of her duty but to prevent your oppose that wish event i must inform you don alphonso that your presence here be no longer agreeable either to the baron or myself it be not to talk nonsense to my niece that your relation sent you to germany your business be to travel and i should be sorry to impede any long so excellent a design farewell segnor remember that tomorrow morning we meet for the last time having say this she dart upon me a look of pride contempt and malice and quit the apartment i also retire to mine and consume the night in plan the mean of rescue agnes from the power of her tyrannical aunt after the positive declaration of it mistress it be impossible for me to make a long stay at the castle of lindenberg accordingly i the next day announce my immediate departure the baron declare that it give him sincere pain and he express himself in my favour so warmly that i endeavour to win him over to my interest scarcely have i mention the name of agnes when he stop me short and say that it be totally out of hi power to interfere in the business i saw that it be in vain to argue the baroness govern her husband with despotic sway and i easily perceive that she have prejudice him against the match agnes do not appear i entreated permission to take leave of her but my prayer be reject i be oblige to depart without see her at quit him the baron shook my hand affectionately and assure me that as soon a hi niece be go i might consider hi house a my own farewell don alphonso say the baroness and stretch out her hand to me i take it and offer to carry it to my lip she prevent me her husband be at the other end of the room and out of hear take care of yourself she continue my love be become hatred and my wounded pride shall not be unatoned go where you will my vengeance shall follow you she accompany these word with a look sufficient to make me tremble i answer not but hasten to quit the castle a my chaise drive out of the court i look up to the window of your sister chamber nobody be to be see there i throw myself back despondent in my carriage i be attend by no other servant than a frenchman whom i have hire at strasbourg in stephanos room and my little page whom i before mention to

we proceed half a mile from the castle when he ride up to the chaisedoor take courage segnor say he in spanish which he have already learn to speak with fluency and correctness while you be with the baron i watch the moment when dame cunegonda be below stair and mount into the chamber over that of donna agnes i sing as loud a i could a little german air wellknown to her hoping that she would recollect my voice i be not disappointed for i soon hear her window open i hasten to let down a string with which i have provide myself upon hear the casement close again i draw up the string and

in secret at not have take the precaution to provide a carriage at the village in which case i might have carry off agnes that very night such an attempt be now impracticable neither carriage or horse be to be procure near than munich which be distant from lindenberg two good day journey i be therefore oblige to chime in with her plan which in truth seem well arrange her disguise would secure her from be stop in quit the castle and would enable her to step into the carriage at the very gate without difficulty or losing time agnes recline her head mournfully upon my shoulder and by the light of the moon i saw tear flow down her cheek i strive to dissipate her melancholy and encourage her to look forward to the prospect of happiness i protest in the most solemn term that her virtue and innocence would be safe in my keep and that till the church have make her my lawful wife her honour should be hold by me as sacred a a sister i tell her that my first care should be to find you out lorenzo and reconcile you to our union and i be continue to speak in the same strain when a noise without alarm me suddenly the door of the pavilion be throw open and cunegonda stand before u she have hear agnes steal out of her chamber follow her into the garden and perceive her enter the pavilion favour by the tree which shade it and unperceived by theodore who wait at a little distance she have approach in silence and overheard our whole conversation admirable cry cunegonda in a voice shrill with passion while agnes utter a loud shriek by st barbara young lady you have an excellent invention you must personate the bleeding nun truly what impiety what incredulity marry i have a good mind to let you pursue your plan when the real ghost meet you i warrant you would be in a pretty condition don alphonso you ought to be ashamed of yourself for seduce a young ignorant creature to leave her family and friend however for this time at least i shall mar your wicked design the noble lady shall be inform of the whole affair and agnes must defer play the spectre till a good opportunity farewell segnor donna agnes let me have the honour of conduct your ghostship back to your apartment she approach the sopha on which her tremble pupil be seat take her by the hand and prepare to lead her from the pavilion i detain her and strive by entreaty soothe promise and flattery to win her to my party but find all that i could say of no avail i abandon the vain attempt your obstinacy must be it own punishment say i but one resource remain to save agnes and myself and i shall not hesitate to employ it terrified at this menace she again endeavour to quit the pavilion but i seize her by the wrist and detain her forcibly at the same moment theodore who have follow her into the room close the door and prevent her escape i take the veil of agnes i throw it round the duenna head who utter such piercing shriek that in spite of our distance from the castle i dread their be hear at length i succeed in gag her so compleatly that she could not produce a single sound theodore and myself with some difficulty next contrive to bind her hand and foot with our handkerchief and i advise agnes to regain her chamber with all diligence i promise that no harm should happen to cunegonda bad her remember that on the fifth of may i should be in wait at the great gate of the castle and take of her an affectionate farewell trembling and uneasy she have scarce power enough to signify her consent to my plan and flee back to her apartment in disorder and confusion in the meanwhile theodore assist me in carry off my antiquated prize she be hoist over the wall place before me upon my horse like a portmanteau and i gallop away with her from the castle of lindenberg the unlucky duenna never have make a more disagreeable journey in her life she be jolt and shake till she be become little more than an animated mummy not to mention her fright when we wad through a small river through which it be necessary to pass in order to regain the village before we reach the inn i have already determine how to dispose of the troublesome cunegonda we enter the street in which the inn stand and while the page knock i wait at a little distance the landlord open the door with a lamp in hi hand give me the light say theodore my master be come he snatch the lamp hastily and purposely let it fall upon the ground the landlord return to the kitchen to relight the lamp leave the door open i profit by the obscurity sprang from my horse with cunegonda in my arm dart up stair reach my chamber unperceived and unlock the door of a spacious closet stow her within it and then turn the key the landlord and theodore soon after appear with light the former express himself a little surprised at my return so late but ask no impertinent question he soon quit the room and leave me to exult in the success of my undertaking i immediately pay a visit to my prisoner i strive to persuade her submit with patience to her temporary confinement my attempt be unsuccessful unable to speak or move she express her fury by her look and except at meal i never dare to unbind her or release her from the gag at such time i stand over her with a drawn sword and protest that if she utter a single cry i would plunge it in her bosom as soon a she have do eat the gag be replace i be conscious that this proceeding be cruel and could only be justify by the urgency of circumstance a to theodore he have no scruple upon the subject cunegondas captivity entertain him beyond measure during hi abode in the castle a continual warfare have be carry on between him and the duenna and now that he find hi enemy so absolutely in hi power he triumph without mercy he seem to think of nothing but how to find out new mean of plague her sometimes he affect to pity her misfortune then laugh at abused and mimic her he play her a thousand trick each more provoking than the other and amuse himself by tell her that her elopement must have occasion much surprise at the baron this be in fact the case no one except agnes could imagine what be become of dame cunegonda every hole and corner be search for her the pond be drag and the wood underwent a thorough examination still no dame cunegonda make her appearance agnes keep the secret and i keep the duenna the baroness therefore remain in total ignorance respect the old woman fate but suspect her to have perish by suicide thus past away five day during which i have prepare every thing necessary for my enterprise on quit agnes i have make it my first business to dispatch a peasant with a letter to lucas at munich order him to take care that a coach and four should arrive about ten oclock on the fifth of may at the village of rosenwald he obey my instruction punctually the equipage arrive at the time appoint a the period of her lady elopement draw near cunegondas rage increase i verily believe that spight and passion would have kill her have i not luckily discover her prepossession in favour of cherry brandy with this favourite liquor she be plentifully supply and theodore always remain to guard her the gag be occasionally remove the liquor seem to have a wonderful effect in soften the acrimony of her nature and her confinement not admit of any other amusement she get drunk regularly once a day just by way of pass the time the fifth of may arrive a period by me never to be forget before the clock strike twelve i betook myself to the scene of action theodore follow me on horseback i conceal the carriage in a spacious cavern of the hill on whose brow the castle be situate this cavern be of considerable depth and among the peasant be know by the name of lindenberg hole the night be calm and beautiful the moonbeam fell upon the antient tower of the castle and shed upon their summit a silver light all be still around me nothing be to be hear except the night breeze sighing among the leaf the distant barking of village dog or the owl who have establish herself in a nook of the deserted eastern turret i hear her melancholy shriek and look upwards she sit upon the ride of a window which i recognize to be that of the haunted room this brought to my remembrance the story of the bleeding nun and i sigh while i reflect on the influence of superstition and weakness of human reason suddenly i hear a faint chorus steal upon the silence of the night what can occasion that noise theodore a stranger of distinction reply he pass through the village today in hi way to the castle he be report to be the father of donna agnes doubtless the baron have give an entertainment to celebrate hi arrival the castle bell announce the hour of midnight this be the usual signal for the family to retire to bed soon after i perceive light in the castle moving backwards and forward in different direction i conjecture the company to be separate i could hear the heavy door grate a they open with difficulty and a they close again the rotten casement rattle in their frame the chamber of agnes be on the other side of the castle i tremble l she should have fail in obtain the key of the haunted room through this it be necessary for her to pass in order to reach the narrow staircase by which the ghost be suppose to descend into the great hall agitated by this apprehension i keep my eye constantly fix upon the window where i hop to perceive the friendly glare of a lamp borne by agnes i now hear the massy gate unbar by the candle in hi hand i distinguish old conrad the porter he set the portal door wide open and retire the light in the castle gradually disappear and at length the whole building be wrapt in darkness while i sit upon a broken ridge of the hill the stillness of the scene inspire me with melancholy idea not altogether unpleasing the castle which stand full in my sight form an object equally awful and picturesque it ponderous wall ting by the moon with solemn brightness it old and partlyruined tower lift themselves into the cloud and seem to frown on the plain around them it lofty battlement oergrown with ivy and fold gate expand in honour of the visionary inhabitant make me sensible of a sad and reverential horror yet do not these sensation occupy me so fully a to prevent me from witness with impatience the slow progress of time i approach the castle and venture to walk round it a few ray of light still glimmer in the chamber of agnes i observe them with joy i be still gaze upon them when i perceive a figure draw near the window and the curtain be carefully close to conceal the lamp which burn there convince by this observation that agnes have not abandon our plan i return with a light heartto my former station the halfhour strike the threequarters strike my bosom beat high with hope and expectation at length the wishedfor sound be hear the bell toll one and the mansion echoed with the noise loud and solemn i look up to the casement of the haunted chamber scarcely have five minute elapse when the expect light appear i be now close to the tower the window be not so far from the ground but that i fancy i perceive a female figure with a lamp in her hand move slowly along the apartment the light soon fade away and all be again dark and gloomy occasional gleam of brightness dart from the staircase windows a the lovely ghost past by them i trace the light through the hall it reach the portal and at length i behold agnes pas through the folding gate she be habit exactly a she have describe the spectre a chaplet of bead hung upon her arm her head be envelop in a long white veil her nun dress be stain with blood and she have take care to provide herself with a lamp and dagger she advance towards the spot where i stand i fly to meet her and clasp her in my arm terrified and breathless she be unable to speak she dropt her lamp and dagger and sank upon my bosom in silence i raise her in my arm and convey her to the carriage theodore remain behind in order to release dame cunegonda i also charge him with a letter to the baroness explain the whole affair and entreat her good office in reconcile don gaston to my union with hi daughter i discover to her my real name i prove to her that my birth and expectation justify my pretending to her niece and assure her though it be out of my power to return her love that i would strive unceasingly to obtain her esteem and friendship i step into the carriage where agnes be already seat theodore close the door and the postillion drive away at first i be delight with the rapidity of our progress but as soon a we be in no danger of pursuit i call to the driver and bad them moderate their pace they strive in vain to obey me the horse refuse to answer the rein and continue to rush on with astonish swiftness the postillion redouble their effort to stop them but by kick and plunge the beast soon release themselves from this restraint utter a loud shriek the driver be hurl upon the ground immediately thick cloud obscure the sky the wind howl around u the lightning flash and the thunder roar tremendously never do i behold so frightful a tempest terrify by the jar of contend element the horse seem every moment to increase their speed nothing could interrupt their career they drag the carriage through hedge and ditch dash down the most dangerous precipice and seem to vye in swiftness with the rapidity of the wind all this while my companion lay motionless in my arm truly alarm by the magnitude of the danger i be in vain attempt to recall her to her sens when a loud crash announce that a stop be put to our progress in the most disagreeable manner the carriage be shatter to piece in fall i strike my temple against a flint the pain of the wound the violence of the shock and apprehension for the safety of agnes combine to overpower me so compleatly that my sens forsake me and i lay without animation on the ground i probably remain for some time in this situation since when i open my eye it be broad daylight several peasant be stand round me and seem dispute whether my recovery be possible i speak german tolerably well as soon a i could utter an articulate sound i enquire after agnes what be my surprise and distress when assure by the peasant that nobody have be see answer the description which i give of her they tell me that in go to their daily labour they have be alarm by observe the fragment of my carriage and by hear the groan of an horse the only one of the four which remain alive the other three lay dead by my side nobody be near me when they come up and much time have be lose before they succeed in recover me uneasy beyond expression respect the fate of my companion i beseech the peasant to disperse themselves in search of her i describe her dress and promise immense reward to whoever brought me any intelligence a for myself it be impossible for me to join in the pursuit i have break two of my rib in the fall my arm be dislocate hung useless by my side and my left leg be shatter so terribly that i never expect to recover it use the peasant comply with my request all leave me except four who make a litter of bough and prepare to convey me to the neighbour town i enquire it name it prove to be ratisbon and i could scarcely persuade myself that i have travel to such a distance in a single night i tell the countryman that at one oclock that morning i have past

already make them my wild and frantic manner confirm the byestanders in the idea of my be delirious no sign of the lady have appear they believe her to be a creature fabricate by my overheated brain and pay no attention to my entreaty however the hostess assure me that a fresh enquiry should be make but i find afterwards that her promise be only give to quiet me no further step be take in the business though my baggage be leave at munich under the care of my french servant have prepare myself for a long journey my purse be amply furnished besides my equipage prove me to be of distinction and in consequence all possible attention be pay me at the inn the day pass away still no news arrive of agnes the anxiety of fear now give place to despondency i cease to rave about her and be plunge in the depth of melancholy reflection perceive me to be silent and tranquil my attendant believe my delirium to have abate and that my malady have take a favourable turn accord to the physician order i swallow a composing medicine and as soon a the night shut in my attendant withdrew and leave me to repose that repose i woo in vain the agitation of my bosom chase away sleep restless in my mind in

staircase by an involuntary movement i start up in my bed and draw back the curtain a single rushlight which glimmer upon the hearth shed a faint gleam through the apartment which be hung with tapestry the door be throw open with violence a figure enter and draw near my bed with solemn measure step with tremble apprehension i examine this midnight visitor god almighty it be the bleeding nun

the spectre with horror too great to be describe my blood be freeze in my vein i would have call for aid but the sound expire ere it could pass my lip my nerve be bind up in impotence and i remain in the same attitude inanimate a a statue the visionary nun look upon me for some minute in silence there be something petrifying in her regard at length in a low sepulchral voice she pronounce the following word breathless with fear i listen while she repeat my own expression the apparition seat herself opposite to me at the foot of the bed and be silent her eye be fix earnestly upon mine they seem endow with the property of the rattlesnake for i strive in vain to look off her my eye be fascinate and i have not the power of withdraw them from the spectre in this attitude she remain for a whole long hour without speaking or move nor be i able to do either at length the clock strike two the apparition rise from her seat and approach the side of the bed she grasp with her icy finger my

awake fatigue and unrefreshed my fever seem rather augment than diminish the agitation of my mind impede my fractured bone from knit i have frequent fainting fit and during the whole day the physician judge it expedient not to quit me for two hour together the singularity of my adventure make me determine to conceal it from every one since i could not expect that a circumstance so strange should gain credit i be very uneasy about agnes i know not what she would think at not find me at the rendezvous and dread her entertaining suspicion of my fidelity however i depend upon theodores discretion and trust that my letter to the baroness would convince her of the rectitude of my intention these consideration somewhat lighten my inquietude upon her account but the impression leave upon my mind by my nocturnal visitor grow strong with every succeed moment the night draw near i dread it arrival yet i strive to persuade myself that the ghost would appear no more and at all event i desire that a servant might sit up in my chamber the fatigue of my body from not have sleep on the former night cooperate with the strong opiate administer to me in profusion at length procure me that repose of

by success the retreat which conceal agnes remain an impenetrable mystery and i begin to abandon all hope of recover her about eight month ago i be return to my hotel in a melancholy humour have past the evening at the playhouse the night be dark and i be unaccompanied plunged in reflection which be far from be agreeable i perceive not that three men have follow me from the theatre till on turn into an unfrequented street they all attack me at the same time with the utmost fury i spring back a few pace draw my sword and throw my cloak over my left arm the obscurity of the night be in my favour for the most part the blow of the assassin be aim at random fail to touch me i at length be fortunate enough to lay one of my adversary at my foot but before this i have already receive so many wound and be so warmly press that my destruction would have be inevitable have not the clashing of sword call a cavalier to my assistance he run towards me with hi sword draw several domestic follow him with torch hi arrival make the combat equal yet would not the bravo abandon their design till the servant be on the point of join u they then flee away and we lose them in the obscurity the stranger now address himself to me with politeness and enquire whether i be wound faint with the loss of blood i could scarcely thank him for hi seasonable aid and entreat him to let some of hi servant convey me to the hotel de la cisterna i no sooner mention the name than he profest himself an acquaintance of my father and declare that he would not permit my be transport to such a distance before my wound have be examine he add that hi house be hard by and beg me to accompany him thither hi manner be so earnest that i could not reject hi offer and lean upon hi arm a few minute bring me to the porch of a magnificent hotel on enter the house an old greyheaded domestic come to welcome my conductor he enquire when the duke hi master meant to quit the country and be answer that he would remain there yet some month my deliverer then desire the family surgeon to be summon without delay hi order be obey i be seat upon a sopha in a noble apartment and my wound be examine they be declare to be very slight the surgeon however advise me not to expose myself to the night air and the stranger press me so earnestly to take a bed in hi house that i consent to remain where i be for the present being now leave alone with my deliverer i take the opportunity of thank him in more express term than i have do hitherto but he beg me to be silent upon the subject i esteem myself happy say he in have have it in my power to render you this little service and i shall think myself eternally oblige to my daughter for detain me so late at the convent of st clare the high esteem in which i have ever hold the marquis de la cisterna though accident have not permit our be so intimate a i could wish make me rejoice in the opportunity of make hi son acquaintance i be certain that my brother in whose house you now be will lament hi not be at madrid to receive you himself but in the duke absence i be master of the family and may assure you in hi name that every thing in the hotel de medina be perfectly at your disposal conceive my surprize lorenzo at discover in the person of my preserver don gaston de medina it be only to be equal by my secret satisfaction at the assurance that agnes inhabit the convent of st clare this latter sensation be not a little weakened when in answer to my seemingly indifferent question he tell me that hi daughter have really take the veil i suffer not my grief at this circumstance to take root in my mind i flatter myself with the idea that my uncle credit at the court of rome would remove this obstacle and that without difficulty i should obtain for my mistress a dispensation from her vow buoyed up with this hope i calm the uneasiness of my bosom and i redouble my endeavour to appear grateful for the attention and pleased with the society of don gaston a domestic now enter the room and inform me that the bravo whom i have wound discover some sign of life i desire that he might be carry to my father hotel and that as soon a he recover hi voice i would examine him respect hi reason for attempt my life i be answer that he be already able to speak though with difficulty don gastons curiosity make him press me to interrogate the assassin in hi presence but this curiosity i be by no mean incline to gratify one reason be that doubt from whence the blow come i be unwilling to place before don gastons eye the guilt of a sister another be that i fear to be recognize for alphonso dalvarada and precaution take in consequence to keep me from the sight of agnes to avow my passion for hi daughter and endeavour to make him enter into my scheme what i know of don gastons character convince me would be an imprudent step and consider it to be essential that he should know me for no other than the conde de la cisterna i be determine not to let him hear the bravo confession i insinuate to him that a i suspect a lady to be concern in the business whose name might accidentally escape from the assassin it be necessary for me to examine the man in private don gastons delicacy would not permit hi urge the point any long and in consequence the bravo be convey to my hotel the next morning i take leave of my host who be to return to the duke on the same day my wound have be so trifle that except be oblige to wear my arm in a sling for a short time i felt no inconvenience from the night adventure the surgeon who examine the bravo wound declare it to be mortal he have just time to confess that he have be instigate to murder me by the revengeful donna rodolpha and expire in a few minute after all my thought be now bent upon get to the speech of my lovely nun theodore set himself to work and for this time with good success he attack the gardener of st clare so forcibly with bribe and promise that the old man be entirely gain over to my interest and it be settle that i should be introduce into the convent in the character of hi assistant the plan be put into execution without delay disguise in a common habit and a black patch cover one of my eye i be present to the lady prioress who condescend to approve of the gardener choice i immediately enter upon my employment botany have be a favourite study with me i be by no mean at a loss in my new station for some day i continue to work in the convent garden without meet the object of my disguise on the fourth morning i be more successful i hear the voice of agnes and be speed towards the sound when the sight of the domina stop me i draw back with caution and conceal myself behind a thick clump of tree the prioress advance and seat herself with agnes on a bench at no great distance i hear her in an angry tone blame her companion continual melancholy she tell her that to weep the loss of any lover in her situation be a crime but that to weep the loss of a faithless one be folly and absurdity in the extreme agnes reply in so low a voice that i could not distinguish her word but i perceive that she use term of gentleness and submission the conversation be interrupt by the arrival of a young pensioner who inform the domina that she be wait for in the parlour the old lady rise kiss the cheek of agnes and retire the newcomer remain agnes speak much to her in praise of somebody whom i could not make out but her auditor seem highly delighted and interested by the conversation the nun show her several letter the other peruse them with evident pleasure obtain permission to copy them and withdraw for that purpose to my great satisfaction no sooner be she out of sight than i quit my concealment fear to alarm my lovely mistress i draw near her gently intend to discover myself by degree but who for a moment can deceive the eye of love she raise her head at my approach and recognise me in spite of my disguise at a single glance she rise hastily from her seat with an exclamation of surprize and attempt to retire but i follow her detain her and entreat to be hear persuaded of my falsehood she refuse to listen to me and order me positively to quit the garden it be now my turn to refuse i protest that however dangerous might be the consequence i would not leave her till she have hear my justification i assure her that she have be deceive by the artifice of her relation that i could convince her beyond the power of doubt that my passion have be pure and disinterested and i ask her what should induce me to seek her in the convent be i influence by the selfish motif which my enemy have ascribe to me my prayer my argument and vow not to quit her till she have promise to listen to me united to her fear l the nun should see me with her to her natural curiosity and to the affection which she still felt for me in spite of my suppose desertion at length prevail she tell me that to grant my request at that moment be impossible but she engage to be in the same spot at eleven that night and to converse with me for the last time have obtain this promise i release her hand and she flee back with rapidity towards the convent i communicate my success to my ally the old gardener he point out an hiding place where i might shelter myself till night without fear of a discovery thither i betook myself at the hour when i ought to have retire with my suppose master and wait impatiently for the appointed time the chill of the night be in my favour since it keep the other nun confine to their cell agnes alone be insensible of the inclemency of the air and before eleven join me at the spot which have witness our former interview secure from interruption i relate to her the true cause of my disappearing on the fatal fifth of may

her the cardinalduke of lermas influence at the court of rome i assure her that i should easily obtain a dispensation from her vow and i doubt not but don gaston would coincide with my view when informed of my real name and long attachment agnes reply that since i encourage such an hope i could know but little of her father liberal and kind in every other respect superstition form the only stain upon hi character upon this head he be inflexible he sacrifice hi dearest interest to hi scruple and would consider it an insult to suppose him capable of authorise hi daughter to break her vow to heaven but suppose say i interrupt her suppose that he should disapprove of our union let him remain ignorant of my proceeding till i have rescue you from the prison in which you be now confine once my wife you be free from hi authority i need from him no pecuniary assistance and when he see hi resentment to be unavailing he will doubtless restore you to hi favour but let the bad happen
