have give himself out to be a friend of mine she wish to know whether i have any knowledge of him i reply in the negative i have then very little idea that alphonso dalvarada and the marquis de la cisterna be one and the same person the description give me of the first by no mean tally with what i know of the latter in this i easily recognize donna rodolphas perfidious character every word of this account be stamp with mark of her malice of her falsehood of her talent for misrepresent those whom she wish to injure forgive me medina for speak so freely of your relation the mischief which she have do me authorise my resentment and when you have hear my story you will be convince that my expression have not be too severe he then begin hi narrative in the following manner long experience my dear lorenzo have convince me how generous be your nature i wait not for your declaration of ignorance respect your sister adventure to suppose that they have be purposely conceal from you have they reach your knowledge from what misfortune should both agnes and myself have escape fate have ordain it otherwise you be on your travel when i first become acquaint with your sister and a our

year after i quit it i immediately set out upon my travel my father supply me liberally with money but he insist upon my conceal my rank and present myself a no more than a private gentleman this command be issue by the counsel of hi friend the duke of villa hermosa a nobleman for whose ability and knowledge of the world i have ever entertain the most profound veneration believe me say he my dear raymond you will hereafter feel the benefit of this temporary degradation ti true that a the conde de la cisterna you would have be receive with open arm and your youthful vanity might have felt gratify by the attention shower upon you from all side at present much will depend upon yourself you have excellent recommendation but it must be your own business to make them of use to you you must lay yourself out to please you must labour to gain the approbation of those to whom you be present they who would have court the friendship of the conde de la cisterna will have no interest in find out the merit or bear patiently with the fault of alphonso dalvarada consequently when you find yourself really like you may safely ascribe it to your good quality not your rank and the distinction show you will be infinitely more flattering besides your exalted birth would not permit your mix with the low class of society which will now be in your power and from which in my opinion you will derive considerable benefit do not confine yourself to the illustrious of those country through which you pass examine the manner and custom of the multitude enter into the cottage and by observe how the vassal of foreigner be treat learn to diminish the burthen and augment the comfort of your own accord to my idea of those advantage which a youth destine to the possession of power and wealth may reap from travel he should not consider a the least essential the opportunity of mix with the class below him and become an eyewitness of the suffering of the people forgive me lorenzo if i seem tedious in my narration the close connexion which now exist between u make me anxious that you should know every particular respecting me and in my fear of omit the least circumstance which may induce

assumed title of don alphonso dalvarada and attend by a single domestic of approved fidelity paris be my first station for some time i be enchant with it a indeed must be every man who be young rich and fond of pleasure yet among all it gaiety i felt that something be want to my heart i grow sick of dissipation i discover that the people among whom i live and whose exterior be so polished and seduce be at bottom frivolous unfeeling and insincere i turn from the inhabitant of paris with disgust and quit that theatre of luxury without heave one sigh of regret i now bend my course towards germany intend to visit most of the principal court prior to this expedition i mean to make some little stay at strasbourg on quit my chaise at luneville to take some refreshment i observe a splendid equipage attend by four domestic in rich livery wait at the door of the silver lion soon after a i look out of the window i saw a lady of noble presence follow by two female attendant step into the

night be already close round u and strasbourg which be the near town be still distant from u several league it seem to me that my only alternative to pass the night in the forest be to take my servant horse and ride on to strasbourg an undertaking at that season very far from agreeable however see no other resource i be oblige to make up my mind to it accordingly i communicate my design to the postillion tell him that i would send people to assist him as soon a i reach strasbourg i have not much confidence in hi honesty but stephano be wellarmed and the driver to all appearance considerably advance in year i believe i run no danger of lose my baggage luckily a i then think an opportunity present itself of pass the night more agreeably than i expect on mention my design of proceeding by myself to strasbourg the postillion shake hi head in disapprobation it be a long way say he you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide besides monsieur seem unaccustomed to the season severity and ti possible that unable to sustain the excessive cold what use be there to present me with all these objection say i impatiently interrupt him i have no other resource i run still great risque of perish with cold by pass the night in the forest pass the night in the forest he reply oh by st denis we be not in quite so bad a plight a that come to yet if i be not mistake we be scarcely five minute walk from the cottage of my old friend baptist he be a woodcutter and a very honest fellow i doubt not but he will shelter you for the night with pleasure in the meantime i can take the saddlehorse ride to strasbourg and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day and in the name of god say i how could you leave me so long in suspense why do you not tell me of this cottage sooner what excessive stupidity i think that perhaps monsieur would not deign to accept absurd come come say no more but conduct u without delay to the woodman cottage he obey and we move onwards the horse contrive with some difficulty to drag the shattered vehicle after u my servant be become almost speechless and i begin to feel the effect of the cold myself before we reach the wishedfor cottage it be a small but neat building a we draw near it i rejoice at observe through the window the blaze of a comfortable fire our conductor knock at the door it be some time before any one answer the people within seem in doubt whether we should be admit come come friend baptist cry the driver with impatience what be you about are you asleep or will you refuse a night lodge to a

command with every mark of unwillingness her countenance have displease me on the first moment of my examine it yet upon the whole her feature be handsome unquestionably but her skin be sallow and her person thin and meagre a louring gloom overspread her countenance and it bore such visible mark of rancour and illwill as could not escape be notice by the most inattentive observer her every look and action express discontent and impatience and the answer which she give baptist when he reproach her goodhumouredly for her dissatisfied air be tart short and cut in tine i conceive at first sight equal disgust for her and prepossession in favour of her husband whose appearance be calculate to inspire esteem and confidence hi countenance be open sincere and friendly hi manner have all the peasant honesty unaccompanied by hi rudeness hi cheek be broad full and ruddy and in the solidity of hi person he seem to offer an ample apology for the leanness of hi wife from the wrinkle on hi brow i judge him to be turn of sixty but he bore hi year well and seem still hearty and strong the wife could not be more than thirty but in spirit and vivacity she be infinitely old than the husband however in spite of her unwillingness marguerite begin to prepare the supper while the woodman converse gaily on different subject the postillion who have be furnish with a bottle of spirit be now ready to set out for strasbourg and enquire whether i have any further command for strasbourg interrupt baptist you be not go thither tonight i beg your pardon if i do not fetch workman to mend the

i pity him for be chain for life to a partner of such illhumour ah lord monsieur every one have hi share of grievance and marguerite have fall to mine besides after all she be only cross and not malicious the bad be that her affection for two child by a former husband make her play the stepmother with my two son she can not bear the sight of them and by her goodwill they would never set a foot within my door but on this point i always stand firm and never will consent to abandon the poor lad to the world mercy a she have often solicit me to do in every thing els i let her have her own way and truly she manage a family rarely that i must say for her we be converse in this manner when our discourse be interrupt by a loud halloo which ring through the forest my son i hope exclaim the

enquire how far they be still from strasbourg a he address himself to me i answer in the number of mile which claude have tell me upon which a volley of curse be vent against the driver for have lose their way the person in the coach be now inform of the distance of strasbourg and also that the horse be so fatigue a to be incapable of proceed far a lady who appear to be the principal express much chagrin at this intelligence but a there be no remedy one of the attendant ask the woodman whether he could furnish them with lodge for the night he seem much embarrass and reply in the negative adding that a spanish gentleman and hi servant be already in possession of the only spare apartment in hi house on hear this the gallantry of my nation would not permit me to retain those accommodation of which a female be in want i instantly signify to the woodman that i transfer my right to the lady he make some objection but i overrule them and hasten to the carriage open the door and assist the lady to descend i immediately recognize her for the same person whom i have see at the inn at luneville i take an opportunity of ask one of her attendant what be her name the baroness lindenberg be the answer i could not but remark how different a reception our host have give these newcomer and myself hi reluctance to admit them be visibly express on hi countenance and he prevail on himself with difficulty to tell the lady that she be welcome i conduct her into the house and place her in the armedchair which i have just quit she thank me very graciously and make a thousand

baroness are there robber hereabout so it be say madame for my own part i have travel through the wood at all hour and never meet with one of them here marguerite return her stepson draw her to the other end of the room and whisper her for some minute by the look which they cast towards u at interval i conjecture them to be enquire our business in the cottage in the meanwhile the baroness express her apprehension that her husband would be suffer much anxiety upon her account she have intend to send on one of her servant to inform the baron of her delay but the account which the young men give of the forest render this plan impracticable claude relieve her from her embarrassment he inform her that he be under the necessity of reach strasbourg that night and that would she trust him with a letter she might depend upon it be safely deliver and how come it say i that you be under no apprehension of meet these robber alas monsieur a poor man with a large family must not lose certain profit because ti attend with a little danger and perhaps my lord the baron may give me a trifle for my pain besides i have nothing to lose except my life and that will not be worth the robber take i think hi argument bad and advise hi wait till the morning but a the baroness do not second me i be oblige to give up the point the baroness lindenberg a i find afterwards have long be accustom to sacrifice the interest of other to her own and her wish to send claude to strasbourg blind her to the danger of the undertaking accordingly it be resolve that he should set out without delay the baroness write her letter to her husband and i send a few line to my banker apprise him that i should not be at strasbourg till the next day claude take our letter and leave the cottage the lady declare herself much fatigue by her journey besides have come from some distance the driver have contrive to lose their way in the forest she now address herself to marguerite desiring to be show to her chamber and permit to take half an hour repose one of the waitingwomen be immediately summon she appear with a light and the baroness follow her up stairs the cloth be spread in the chamber where i be and marguerite soon give me to understand that i be in her way her hint be too broad to be easily mistake i therefore desire one of the young men to conduct me to the chamber where i be to sleep and where i could remain till supper be ready which chamber be it mother say robert the one with green hanging she reply i have just be at the trouble of get it ready and have put fresh sheet upon the bed if the gentleman choose to lollop and lounge upon it he may make it again himself for me you be out of humour mother but that be no novelty have the goodness to follow me monsieur he open the door and advance towards a narrow staircase you have get no light say marguerite be it your own neck or the gentleman that you have a mind to break she cross by me and put a candle into robert hand have receive which he begin to ascend the staircase jacques be employ in lay the cloth and hi back be turn towards me marguerite seize the moment when we be unobserved she catch my hand and press it strongly look at the sheet say she a she pass me and immediately resume her former occupation startle by the abruptness of her action i remain a if petrified robert voice desire me to follow him recall me to myself i ascend the staircase my conductor usher me into a chamber where an excellent woodfire be blaze upon the hearth he place the light upon the table enquire whether i have any further command and on my replying in the negative he leave me to myself you may be certain that the moment when i find myself alone be that on which i comply with marguerite injunction i take the candle hastily approach the bed and turn down the coverture what be my astonishment my horror at find the sheet crimson with blood at that moment a thousand confuse idea pass before my imagination the robber who infest the wood marguerite exclamation respect her child the arm and appearance of the two young men and the various anecdote which i have hear relate respect the secret correspondence which frequently exist between bandit and postillion all these circumstance flash upon my mind and inspire me with doubt and apprehension i ruminate on the most probable mean of ascertain the truth of my conjecture suddenly i be aware of someone below pace hastily backwards and forward every thing now appear to me an object of suspicion with precaution i draw near the window which a the room have be long shut up be leave open in spite of the cold i venture to look out the beam of the moon permit me to distinguish a man whom i have no difficulty to recognize for my host i watch hi movement he walk swiftly then stop and seem to listen he stamp upon the ground and beat hi stomach with hi arm a if to guard himself from the inclemency of the season at the least noise if a voice be hear in the low part of the house if a bat flit past him or the wind rattle amidst the leafless bough he start and look round with anxiety plague take him say he at length with impatience what can he be about he speak in a low voice but a he be just below my window i have no difficulty to distinguish hi word i now hear the step of one approach baptist go towards the sound he join a man whom hi low stature and the horn suspend from hi neck declare to be no other than my faithful claude whom i have suppose to be already on hi way to strasbourg expecting their discourse to throw some light upon my situation i hasten to put myself in a condition to hear it with safety for this purpose i extinguish the candle which stand upon a table near the bed the flame of the fire be not strong enough to betray me and i immediately resume my place at the window the object of my curiosity have station themselves directly under it i suppose that during my momentary absence the woodman have be blame claude for tardiness since when i return to the window the latter be endeavour to excuse hi fault however add he my diligence at present shall make up for my past delay on that condition answer baptist i shall readily forgive you but in truth a you share equally with u in our prize your own interest will make you use all possible diligence twould be a shame to let such a noble booty escape u you say that this spaniard be rich hi servant boast at the inn that the effect in hi chaise be worth above two thousand pistol oh how i curse stephanos imprudent vanity and i have be tell continue the postillion that this baroness carry about her a casket of jewel of immense value may be so but i have rather she have stay away the spaniard be a secure prey the boy and myself could easily have master him and hi servant and then the two thousand pistol would have be share between u four now we must let in the band for a share and perhaps the whole covey may escape u should our friend have betaken themselves to their different post before you reach the cavern all will be lose the lady attendant be too numerous for u to overpower them unless our associate arrive in time we must need let these traveller set out tomorrow without damage or hurt ti plaguy unlucky that my comrade who drive the coach should be those unacquainted with our confederacy but never fear friend baptist an hour will bring me to the cavern it be now but ten oclock and by twelve you may expect the arrival of the band by the bye take care of your wife you know how strong be her repugnance to our mode of life and she may find mean to give information to the lady servant of our design oh i be secure of her silence she be too much afraid of me and fond of her child to dare to betray my secret besides jacques and robert keep a strict eye over her and she be not permit to set a foot out of the cottage the servant be safely lodge in the barn i shall endeavour to keep all quiet till the arrival of our friend be i assure of your find them the stranger should be dispatch this instant but a it be possible for you to miss the bandit i be fearful of be summon to produce them by their domestic in the morning and suppose either of the traveller should discover your design then we must poignard those in our power and take our chance about master the rest however to avoid run such a risque hasten to the cavern the bandit never leave it before eleven and if you use diligence you may reach it in time to stop them tell robert that i have take hi horse my own have break hi bridle and escape into the wood what be the watchword the reward of courage ti sufficient i hasten to the cavern and i to rejoin my guest l my absence should create suspicion farewell and be diligent these worthy associate now separate the one bent hi course towards the stable while the other return to the house you may judge what must have be my feeling during this conversation of which i lose not a single syllable i dare not trust myself to my reflection nor do any mean present itself to escape the danger which threaten me resistance i know to be vain i be unarm and a single man against three however i resolve at least to sell my life as dearly a i could dread l baptist should perceive my absence and suspect me to have overhear the message with which claude be dispatch i hastily relighted my candle and quit the chamber on descend i find the table spread for six person the baroness sat by the fireside marguerite be employ in dress a sallad and her stepson be whisper together at the further end of the room baptist have the round of the garden to make ere he could reach the cottage door be not yet arrive i seat myself quietly opposite to the baroness a glance upon marguerite tell her that her hint have not be throw away upon me how different do she now appear to me what before seem gloom and sullenness i now find to be disgust at her associate and compassion for my danger i look up to her a to my only resource yet know her to be watch by her husband with a suspicious eye i could place but little reliance on the exertion of her goodwill in spite of all my endeavour to conceal it my agitation be but too visibly express upon my countenance i be pale and both my word and action be disorder and embarrass the young men observe this and enquire the cause i attribute it to excess of fatigue and the violent effect produce on me by the severity of the season whether they believe me or not i will not pretend to say they at least ceased to embarrass me with their question i strive to divert my attention from the peril which surround me by converse on different subject with the baroness i talk of germany declare my intention of visit it immediately god know that i little think at that moment of ever see it she reply to me with great ease and politeness profess that the pleasure of make my acquaintance amply compensate for the delay in her journey and give me a press invitation to make some stay at the castle of lindenberg a she speak thus the youth exchange a malicious smile which declare that she would be fortunate if she ever reach that castle herself this action do not escape me but i conceal the emotion which it excite in my breast i continue to converse with the lady but my discourse be so frequently incoherent that a she have since inform me she begin to doubt whether i be in my right sense the fact be that while my conversation turn upon one subject my thought be entirely occupy by another i meditate upon the mean of quit the cottage find my way to the barn and give the domestic information of our host design i be soon convinced how impracticable be the attempt jacques and robert watch my every movement with an attentive eye and i be oblige to abandon the idea all my hope now rest upon claudes not find the bandit in that case accord to what i have overheard we should be permit to depart unhurt i shudder involuntarily a baptist enter the room he make many apology for hi long absence but he have be detain by affair impossible to be delay he then entreat permission for hi family to sup at the same table with u without which respect would not authorize hi take such a liberty oh how in my heart i curse the hypocrite how i loathe hi presence who be on the point of deprive me of an existence at that time infinitely dear i have every reason to be satisfy with life i have youth wealth rank and education and the fair prospect present themselves before me i saw those prospect on the point of closing in the most horrible manner yet be i oblige to dissimulate and to receive with a semblance of gratitude the false civility of him who hold the dagger to my bosom the permission which our host demand be easily obtain we seat ourselves at the table the baroness and myself occupy one side the son be opposite to u with their back to the door baptist take hi seat by the baroness at the upper end and the place next to him be leave for hi wife she soon enter the room and place before u a plain but comfortable peasant repast our host think it necessary to apologize for the poorness of the supper he have not be apprize of our come he could only offer u such fare a have be intend for hi own family but add he should any accident detain my noble guest long than they at present intend i hope to give them a well treatment the villain i well know the accident to which he allude i shudder at the treatment which he teach u to expect my companion in danger seem entirely to have get rid of her chagrin at be delay she laugh and converse with the family with infinite gaiety i strive but in vain to follow her example my spirit be evidently force and the constraint which i put upon myself escape not baptist observation come come monsieur cheer up say he you seem not quite recover from your fatigue to raise your spirit what say you to a glass of excellent old wine which be leave me by my father god rest hi soul he be in a good world i seldom produce this wine but a i be not honour with such guest every day this be an occasion which deserve a bottle he then give hi wife a key and instruct her where to find the wine of which he speak she seem by no mean please with the commission she take the key with an embarrassed air and hesitate to quit the table did you hear me say baptist in an angry tone marguerite dart upon him a look of mingled anger and fear and leave the chamber hi eye follow her suspiciously till she have close the door she soon return with a bottle seal with yellow wax she place it upon the table and give the key back to her husband i suspect that this liquor be not present to u without design and i watch marguerite movement with inquietude she be employ in rinse some small horn goblet a she place them before baptist she saw that my eye be fix upon her and at the moment when she think herself unobserved by the bandit she motion to me with her head not to taste the liquor she then resume her place in the mean while our host have draw the cork and fill two of the goblet offer them to the lady and myself she at first make some objection but the instance of baptist be so urgent that she be oblige to comply fear to excite suspicion i hesitate not to take the goblet present to me by it smell and colour i guess it to be champagne but some grain of powder float upon the top convince me that it be not unadulterated however i dare not to express my repugnance to drink it i lift it to my lip and seem to be swallow it suddenly start from my chair i make the best of my way towards a vase of water at some distance in which marguerite have be rinse the goblet i pretend to spit out the wine with disgust and take an opportunity unperceived of empty the liquor into the vase the bandit seem alarm at my action jacques half rise from hi chair put hi hand into hi bosom and i discover the haft of a dagger i return to my seat with tranquillity and affect not to have observe their confusion you have not suit my taste honest friend say i address myself to baptist i never can drink champagne without it produce a violent illness i swallow a few mouthful ere i be aware of it quality and fear that i shall suffer for my
