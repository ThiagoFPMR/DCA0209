walk by the side of a thicket he espyd one of the queen eunuch with several of hi attendant come towards him hunt about in deep concern both here and there like person almost in despair and seek with impatience for something lose of the utmost importanceyoung man say the queen chief eunuch have not you see pray her majesty dog zadig very cooly reply you mean her bitch i presumeyou say very right sir say the eunuch ti a spanielbitch indeedand very small say zadig she have have puppy too lately shes a little lame with her left forefoot and have long earsby your exact description sir you must doubtless have see her say the eunuch almost out of breathbut i have not sir notwithstanding neither do i know but by you that the queen ever have such a favourite bitch just at this critical juncture so various be the turn of fortune wheel the best palfrey in all the king stable have break loose from the groom and get upon the plain of babylonthe head huntsman with all hi inferior officer be in pursuit after him with as much concern a the eunuch about the bitchthe head huntsman addressd himself to zadig and askd him whether he hadnt see the king palfrey run by himno horse say zadig ever gallopd smoother he be about five foot high hi hoof be very small hi tail be about three foot six inch long the stud of hi bit be of pure gold about carat and hi shoe be of silver about eleven penny weight apiecewhat course do he take pray sir whereabouts be he say the huntsman i never sit eye on him replyd zadig not i neither do i ever hear before now that hi majesty have such a palfrey the head huntsman as well a the head eunuch upon hi answer their interrogatory so very exactly not doubt in the least but that zadig have clandestinely conveyd both the bitch and the horse away securd him and carry him before the grand desterham who condemnd him to the knout and to be confind for life in some remote and lonely part of siberiano sooner have the sentence be pronouncd but the horse and bitch be both foundthe judge be in some perplexity in this odd affair and yet think it absolutely necessary a the man be innocent to recal their decreehowever they lay a fine upon him of four hundred ounce of gold for hi false declaration of hi not have see what doubtless he do and the fine be orderd to be deposit in court accordingly on the payment whereof he be permit to bring hi cause on to a hearing before the grand desterham on the day appoint for that purpose he opend the cause himself in term to this or the like effect ye bright star of justice ye profound abyss of universal knowledge ye mirror of equity who have in you the solidity of lead the hardness of steel the lustre of a diamond and the resemblance of the pure gold since ye have condescend so far a to admit of my address to this august assembly i here in the most solemn manner swear to you by orosmades that i never saw the queen illustrious bitch nor the sacred palfrey of the king of kingsill be ingenuous however and declare the truth and nothing but the truthas i be walk by the thicket side where i meet with her majesty most venerable chief eunuch and the king most illustrious chief huntsman i perceivd upon the sand the footstep of an animal and i easily inferrd that it must be a little onethe several small tho long ridge of land between the footstep of the creature give me just ground to imagine it be a bitch whose teat hang down and for that reason i conclude she have but lately puppdas i observd likewise some other trace in some degree different which seemd to have grazd all the way upon the surface of the sand on the side of the forefoot i know well enough she must have have long earsand forasmuch a i discernd with some degree of curiosity that the sand be every where less hollowd by one foot in particular than by the other three i conceivd that the bitch of our most august queen be somewhat lamish if i may presume to say so a to the palfrey of the king of king give me leave to inform you that a i be walk down the lane by the thicketside i take particular notice of the print make upon the sand by a horse shoe and find that their distance be in exact proportion from that observation i conclude the palfrey gallopd wellin the next place the dust of some tree in a narrow lane which be but seven foot broad be here and there sweep off both on the right and on the left about three foot and six inch from the middle of the roadfor which reason i pronouncd the tail of the palfrey to be three foot and a half long with which he have whiskd off the dust on both side a he run alongagain i perceivd under the tree which formd a kind of bower of five foot high some leaf that have be lately fall on the ground and i be sensible the horse must have shake them off from whence i conjecturd he be five foot highas to the bit of hi bridle i know they must be of gold and of the value i mentiond for he have rubbd the stud upon a certain stone which i know to be a touchstone by an experiment that i have make of itto conclude by the print which hi shoe have leave of some flintstone of another nature i conclude hi shoe be silver and of eleven penny weight fineness a i before mentiond the whole bench of judge stand astonishd at the profundity of zadigs nice discernmentthe news be soon carry to the king and the queenzadig be not only the whole subject of the court conversation but hi name be mentiond with the utmost veneration in the king chamber and hi privycounciland notwithstanding several of their magi declard he ought to be burn for a sorcerer yet the king think proper that the fine he have deposit in court should be peremptorily restordthe clerk of the court the tipstaff and other petty officer wait on him in their proper habit in order to refund the four hundred ounce of gold pursuant to the king express order modestly reserve only three hundred and ninety ounce part thereof to defray the fee of the courtand the domesticks swarmd about him likewise in hope of some small consideration zadig upon wind up of the bottom be fully convincd that it be very dangerous to be overwise and be determind to set a watch before the door of hi lip for the future an opportunity soon offerd for the trial of hi resolutiona prisoner of state have just make hi escape and passd under the window of zadigs housezadig be examind thereupon but be absolutely dumbhowever a it be plainly provd upon him that he do look out of the window at the same time he be sentencd to pay five hundred ounce of gold for that misdemeanor and moreover be obligd to thank the court for their indulgence a compliment which the magistrate of babylon expect to be pay themgood god say he to himself have i not substantial reason to complain that my impropitious star should direct me to walk by a woodsside where the queen bitch and the king palfrey should happen to pass by how dangerous be it to pop one head out of one window and in a word how difficult be it for a man to be happy on this side the grave chap iv the envious man a zadig have meet with such a series of misfortune he be determind to ease the weight of them by the study of philosophy and the conversation of select friendshe be still possessd of a little pretty box in the outparts of babylon which be furnishd in a good taste where every artist be welcome and wherein he enjoyd all the rational pleasure that a virtuous man could well wish forin the morning hi library be always open for the use of the learn at night hi table be filld with the most agreeable companion but he be soon sensible by experience how dangerous it be to keep learned men companya warm dispute arose about a certain law of zoroaster which prohibit the eating of griffin but to what purpose say some of the company be that prohibition since there be no such animal in nature some again insist that there must for otherwise zoroaster could never have be so weak a to give hi pupil such a cautionzadig in order to compromize the matter say gentleman if there be such creature in being let u never touch them and if there be not we be well assurd we cant touch them so in either case we shall comply with the commandment a learn man at the upper end of the table who have composd thirteen volume expatiate on every property of the griffin take this affair in a very serious light which would greatly have embarrassd zadig but for the credit of a magus who be brother to hi friend cadorfrom that day forward zadig ever distinguishd and preferrd good before learned company he associate with the most conversible men and the most amiable lady in all babylon he make elegant entertainment which be frequently precede by a concert of musick and enlivend by the most facetious conversation in which a he have felt the smart of it he have lay aside all thought of shew hi wit which be not only the sure proof that a man have none but the most infallible mean to spoil all good company neither the choice of hi friend nor that of hi dish be the result of pride or ostentationhe take delight in appear to be what he actually be and not in seem to be what he be not and by that mean get a great real character than he actually aimd at directly opposite to hi house livd arimazes one puffd up with pride who not meet with success in the world seek hi revenge in rail against all mankindrich a he be it be almost more than he could accomplish to procure evn any parasite about himtho the rattling of the chariot which stoppd at zadigs door be a perfect nuisance to him yet the good character which every body give him be still a high provocationhe would sometimes intrude himself upon zadig and set down at hi table without any invitation when there he would most certainly interrupt the mirth of the company a harpy they say infect the very carrion that they eat arimazes take it in hi head one day to invite a young lady to an entertainment but she instead of accept of hi offer spend the evening at zadigsanother time a zadig and he be chat together at court a minister of state come up to them and invite zadig to supper but take no notice of arimazesthe most implacable aversion have frequently no good foundationsthis gentleman who be calld the envious man would have take away the life of zadig if he could because most people distinguishd him by the title of the happy manan opportunity of do mischief say zoroaster offer itself a hundred time a day but that of do a friend a good office but once a year arimazes go one day to zadigs house when he be walk in hi garden with two friend and a young lady to whom he say abundance of fine thing with no other design but the innocent pleasure of say themtheir conversation turnd on a war that the king have happily put an end to between him and hi vassal the prince of hyrcaniazadig have signalizd himself in that short war commend hi majesty very highly but be more lavish of hi compliment on the ladyhe take out hi pocket book and write four extempore verse on that occasion and give them the lady to readthe gentleman then present beggd to be obligd with a sight of them as well a the lady but either thro modesty or rather a selfconsciousness that he hadnt happily succeed he give them a flat denialhe be sensible that a sudden poetic flight must prove insipid to every one but the person in whose favour it be write whereupon he snapt the table in two whereon the line be write and throw both piece into a rosebush where they be hunt for but to no purposesoon after it happen to rain and all the company fly into the house but arimazesnotwithstanding the shower he continue in the garden and never quit it till he have find one moiety of the tablet which be unfortunately break in such a manner that even the half line be good sense and good metre tho very shortbut what be still more remarkably unfortunate they appeard at first view to be a severe satyr upon the king the word be these to flagrant crime hi crown he owe to peaceful time the bad of foe this be the first moment that ever arimazes be happyhe have it now in hi power to ruin the most virtuous and innocent of menbig with hi execrable joy he fly to hi majesty with this virulent satyr of zadigs under hi own handnot only zadig but hi two friend and the lady be immediately close confindhis cause be soon over for the judge turnd a deaf ear to what he have to saywhen sentence of condemnation be passd upon him arimazes still spiteful be hear to say a he go out of court with an air of contempt that zadigs line be treason indeed but nothing moretho zadig didnt value himself on account of hi genius for poetry yet he be almost distract to find himself condemnd for the bad of traitor and hi two friend and the lady lockd up in a dungeon for a crime of which he be no way guiltyhe wasnt permit to speak one word for himselfhis pocketbook be sufficient evidence against himso strict be the law of babylon he be carry to the place of execution through a croud of spectator who durstnt condole with him and who flockd about him to observe whether hi countenance changd or whether he die with a good gracehis relation be the only real mourner for there be no estate in reversion for them three part of hi effect be confiscate for the king use and the fourth be devote a a reward to the use of the informer just at the time that he be prepare himself for death the king parrot fly from her balcony into zadigs garden and alight on a rosebusha peach that have be blow down and drive by the wind from an adjacent tree just under the bush be glewd a it be to the other moiety of the tabletaway fly the parrot with her booty and returnd to the king lapthe monarch be somewhat curious read the word on the broken tablet which have no meaning in them a he could perceive but seemd to be the broken part of a tetrastickhe be a great admirer of poetry and the odd adventure of hi parrot put him upon reflectionthe queen who recollect full well the line that be write on the fragment of zadigs tablet orderd that part of it to be producd both the broken piece be put together they answer exactly the indenture and then the verse which zadig have write in a flight of loyalty run thus tyrant be prone to flagrant crime to clemency hi crown he owe to concord and to peaceful time love only be the bad of foe upon this the king orderd zadig to be instantly bring before him and hi two friend and the lady to be that moment dischargdzadig a he stand before the king and queen fixd hi eye upon the ground and beggd their majesty pardon for hi little worthless poetical attempthe speak however with such a become grace and with so much modesty and good sense that the king and the queen order him to be bring before them once againhe be bring accordingly and he pleasd them still more and morein short they give him all the immense estate of arimazes who have so unjustly accusd him but zadig generously returnd the wicked informer the whole to a farthingthe envious man however be no way affect but with the restoration of hi effectszadig every day grow more and more in favour at courthe be make a party in all the king pleasure and nothing be do in the privycouncil without himthe queen from that very hour shewd him so much respect and speak to him in such soft and endear term that in process of time it provd of fatal consequence to herself her royal consort to zadig and the whole kingdomzadig now begin to think it be not so difficult a thing to be happy a at first he imagind chap v the force of generosity the time now draw near for the celebration of a grand festival which be keep but once in five yearstwas a constant custom in babylon at the expiration of the term abovementiond to distinguish that citizen from all the rest in the most solemn manner who have do the most generous action and the grandee and magi always sit a judgesthe satrap informd them of every praiseworthy deed that occurrd within hi districtall be put to the vote and the king himself pronouncd the definitive sentencepeople of all rank and degree come from the remote part of the kingdom to be present at this solemnitythe victor whoever he be receivd from the king own hand a golden cup enrichd with precious stone and upon the delivery the king make use of the following salutationreceive this reward of your generosity and may the god grant me thousands of such valuable subject upon this memorable day the king appeard in all the pomp imaginable on hi throne of state surround by hi grandee the magi and the deputy from all the surround nation of every province that attend these public sport where honour be to be acquird not by the velocity of the best racehorse or by bodily strength but by intrinsic meritthe principal satrap proclaimd with an audible voice such action a would entitle the victor to the inestimable prize but never mentiond one word of zadigs greatness of soul in return hi invidious neighbour all hi estate notwithstanding he would have take away hi life that be but a trifle and not worth speaking of the first that be set up for the prize be a judge that have occasiond a citizen to lose a very considerable cause through some mistake for which he be no way responsible and make him restitution out of hi private purse the next candidate be a youth that tho violently in love with one that he intend shortly to make hi spouse yet resignd her to hi friend who be just expire at her foot and moreover give her a portion at the same time after this appeard a soldier who in the hyrcanian war have do a much more glorious action than the lovera gang of hyrcanians have take hi mistress from him he fight them bravely and rescue her out of their hand soon after he be informd that another band of the same party have hurry away hi mother to a place not far distant he leave hi mistress all drownd in tear and run to hi mother assistance after that skirmish be over he return to hi sweetheart and find her just expiringhe would fain have plungd a dagger into hi heart that moment but hi mother remonstrate to him that should he die she should be entirely helpless and upon that account only he have courage to live a little long the judge seemd very much inclind to give their vote for the soldier but the king prevent them by say that the soldier action be praiseworthy enough and so be those of the rest but none of them give me any surprizewhat zadig do yesterday

so many valuable commodity into the indieswhy pray may not they be deemd as antient a the star and if you be so fond of pay your adoration on account of their vast distance why dont you adore the land of the gangarides which lie in the utmost extremity of the earthno say setoc there be something so surprisingly more brilliant in the star than what you speak of that a man must adore them whether he will or not at the close of the evening zadig plant a long range of candle in the front of hi tent where setoc and he be to sup that night and as soon a he perceivd hi patron to be at the door he fell

thatis it possible sir that your countryman should act so absurdly a to pay an ox the tribute of divine worship say the indian absurd a you think it say the other the ox have be the principal object of adoration all over egypt for these hundred and thirty five thousand year and the most abandond egyptian have never be a yet so impious a to gainsay itay sir an hundred thirty five thousand year say you surely you must be out a little in your calculationtis but about fourscore thousand year since india be first inhabitedsure i be we be a more antient people than you be and our brama prohibit the

which the tribute of divine adoration be justly dueall the world will tell you that twas a divine being whose tail be pure gold whose head resemble that of a man tho indeed the feature be much more beautiful and that he condescend to visit the earth three hour every day for the instruction of mankindhe have a numerous issue a be very well know and all of them be powerful monarchsi have a picture of it at home to which a in duty i ought i say my prayer at night before i go to bed and every morning that i risethere be no harm sir a i can conceive in partaking of a piece of roast beef but

you egyptian lay claim to no more than year and you indian but of whereas we have almanacks that be date century backwardstake my word for it i speak nothing but truth renounce your error and ill make each of you a present of a fine portrait of our oanns a native of cambalu entring into the debate say i have a very great veneration not only for the egyptian chaldean greek and celt but for brama apis and the oanns but in my humble opinion the li the chinese term li signifies properly speak natural light or reason and tien the heaven or the supreme beingor a ti by some calld the tien be an object more deserving of divine adoration than any ox or fish how much soever you may boast of their respective perfectionsall i shall say in regard to my native country ti of much great extent than all egypt chaldea and the indie put togetheri shall lay no stress on the antiquity of my country for i imagine ti of much great importance to be the happy people than the most antient under the

general term to this or the like effect my dear friend you have be contest all this while about an important topick in which ti evident you be all unanimously agreedagreed quotha they all cry in an angry tone how so pray why say he to the hot testy celt be it not true that you do not in effect adore this misletoe but that being who create that misletoe and the oak to which it be so closely united doubtless sir replyd the celtand you sir say he to the egyptian you revere thro your venerable apis the great author of every ox beingwe do so say the egyptianthe mighty oanns tho the sovereign
