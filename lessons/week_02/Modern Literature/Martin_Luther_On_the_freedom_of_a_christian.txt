letter of martin luther to pope leo x among those monstrous evil of this age with which i have now for three year be wag war i be sometimes compel to look to you and to call you to mind most bless father leo in truth since you alone be everywhere consider a be the cause of my engaging in war i can not at any time fail to remember you and although i have be compel by the causeless raging of your impious flatterer against me to appeal from your seat to a future councilfearless of the futile decree of your predecessor pius and julius who in their foolish tyranny prohibit such an actionyet i have never be so alienate in feel from your blessedness a not to have seek with all my might in diligent prayer and cry to god all the best gift for you and for your see but those who have hitherto endeavour to terrify me with the majesty of your name and authority i have begin quite to despise and triumph over one thing i see remain which i can not despise and this have be the reason of my write anew to your blessedness namely that i find that blame be cast on me and that it be impute to me a a great offence that in my rashness i be judge to have spar not even your person now to confess the truth openly i be conscious that whenever i have have to mention your person i have say nothing of you but what be honourable and good if i have do otherwise i could by no mean have approve my own conduct but should have support with all my power the judgment of those men concern me nor would anything have please me good than to recant such rashness and impiety i have call you daniel in babylon and every reader thoroughly know with what distinguish zeal i defend your conspicuous innocence against silvester who try to stain it indeed the publish opinion of so many great men and the repute of your blameless life be too widely famed and too much reverence throughout the world to be assailable by any man of however great name or by any art i be not so foolish a to attack one whom everybody praise nay it have be and always will be my desire not to attack even those whom public repute disgrace i be not delight at the fault of any man since i be very conscious myself of the great beam in my own eye nor can i be the first to cast a stone at the adulteress i have indeed inveigh sharply against impious doctrine and i have not be slack to censure my adversary on account not of their bad moral but of their impiety and for this i be so far from be sorry that i have bring my mind to despise the judgment of men and to persevere in this vehement zeal accord to the example of christ who in hi zeal call hi adversary a generation of viper blind hypocrite and child of the devil paul too charge the sorcerer with be a child of the devil full of all subtlety and all malice and defames certain person a evil worker dog and deceiver in the opinion of those delicateeared person nothing could be more bitter or intemperate than paul language what can be more bitter than the word of the prophet the ear of our generation have be make so delicate by the senseless multitude of flatterer that as soon a we perceive that anything of ours be not approve of we cry out that we be be bitterly assail and when we can repel the truth by no other pretence we escape by attribute bitterness impatience intemperance to our adversary what would be the use of salt if it be not pungent or of the edge of the sword if it do not slay accurse be the man who do the work of the lord deceitfully wherefore most excellent leo i beseech you to accept my vindication make in this letter and to persuade yourself that i have never think any evil concern your person far that i be one who desire that eternal blessing may fall to your lot and that i have no dispute with any man concern moral but only concern the word of truth in all other thing i will yield to any one but i neither can nor will forsake and deny the word he who think otherwise of me or have take in my word in another sense do not think rightly and have not take in the truth your see however which be call the court of rome and which neither you nor any man can deny to be more corrupt than any babylon or sodom and quite a i believe of a lost desperate and hopeless impiety this i have verily abominate and have felt indignant that the people of christ should be cheat under your name and the pretext of the church of rome and so i have resist and will resist as long a the spirit of faith shall live in me not that i be strive after impossibility or hop that by my labour alone against the furious opposition of so many flatterer any good can be do in that most disordered babylon but that i feel myself a debtor to my brother and be bind to take thought for them that few of them may be ruin or that their ruin may be less complete by the plague of rome for many year now nothing els have overflow from rome into the worldas you be not ignorantthan the laying waste of good of body and of soul and the bad example of all the bad thing these thing be clear than the light to all men and the church of rome formerly the most holy of all church have become the most lawless den of thief the most shameless of all brothel the very kingdom of sin death and hell so that not even antichrist if he be to come could devise any addition to it wickedness meanwhile you leo be sit like a lamb in the midst of wolf like daniel in the midst of lion and with ezekiel you dwell among scorpion what opposition can you alone make to these monstrous evil take to yourself three or four of the most learned and best of the cardinal what be these among so many you would all perish by poison before you could undertake to decide on a remedy it be all over with the court of rome the wrath of god have come upon her to the uttermost she hat council she dread to be reform she can not restrain the madness of her impiety she fill up the sentence pass on her mother of whom it be say we would have heal babylon but she be not heal let u forsake her it have be your duty and that of your cardinal to apply a remedy to these evil but this gout laugh at the physician hand and the chariot do not obey the rein under the influence of these feeling i have always grieve that you most excellent leo who be worthy of a good age have be make pontiff in this for the roman court be not worthy of you and those like you but of satan himself who in truth be more the ruler in that babylon than you be oh would that have lay aside that glory which your most abandoned enemy declare to be yours you be live rather in the office of a private priest or on your paternal inheritance in that glory none be worthy to glory except the race of iscariot the child of perdition for what happen in your court leo except that the more wicked and execrable any man be the more prosperously he can use your name and authority for the ruin of the property and soul of men for the multiplication of crime for the oppression of faith and truth and of the whole church of god oh leo in reality most unfortunate and sit on a most perilous throne i tell you the truth because i wish you well for if bernard felt compassion for hi anastasius at a time when the roman see though even then most corrupt be a yet rule with good hope than now why should not we lament to whom so much further corruption and ruin have be add in three hundred year be it not true that there be nothing under the vast heaven more corrupt more pestilential more hateful than the court of rome she incomparably surpass the impiety of the turk so that in very truth she who be formerly the gate of heaven be now a sort of open mouth of hell and such a mouth a under the urgent wrath of god can not be block up one course alone be leave to u wretched men to call back and save some few if we can from that roman gulf behold leo my father with what purpose and on what principle it be that i have storm against that seat of pestilence i be so far from have felt any rage against your person that i even hop to gain favour with you and to aid you in your welfare by strike actively and vigorously at that your prison nay your hell for whatever the effort of all mind can contrive against the confusion of that impious court will be advantageous to you and to your welfare and to many other with you those who do harm to her be do your office those who in every way abhor her be glorify christ in short those be christian who be not roman but to say yet more even this never enter my heart to inveigh against the court of rome or to dispute at all about her for see all remedy for her health to be desperate i look on her with contempt and give her a bill of divorcement say to her he that be unjust let him be unjust still and he that be filthy let him be filthy still give myself up to the peaceful and quiet study of sacred literature that by this i might be of use to the brother live about me while i be make some advance in these study satan open hi eye and goad on hi servant john eccius that notorious adversary of christ by the unchecked lust for fame to drag me unexpectedly into the arena try to catch me in one little word concern the primacy of the church of rome which have fall from me in pass that boastful thraso foaming and gnash hi teeth proclaim that he would dare all thing for the glory of god and for the honour of the holy apostolic seat and be puff up respect your power which he be about to misuse he look forward with all certainty to victory seek to promote not so much the primacy of peter a hi own preeminence among the theologian of this age for he think it would contribute in no slight degree to this if he be to lead luther in triumph the result have prove unfortunate for the sophist an incredible rage torment him for he feel that whatever discredit to rome have arise through me have be cause by the fault of himself alone suffer me i pray you most excellent leo both to plead my own cause and to accuse your true enemy i believe it be know to you in what way cardinal cajetan your imprudent and unfortunate nay unfaithful legate act towards me when on account of my reverence for your name i have place myself and all that be mine in hi hand he do not so act a to establish peace which he could easily have establish by one little word since i at that time promise to be silent and to make an end of my case if he would command my adversary to do the same but that man of pride not content with this agreement begin to justify my adversary to give them free licence and to order me to recant a thing which be certainly not in hi commission thus indeed when the case be in the best position it come through hi vexatious tyranny into a much bad one therefore whatever have follow upon this be the fault not of luther but entirely of cajetan since he do not suffer me to be silent and remain quiet which at that time i be entreat for with all my might what more be it my duty to do next come charles miltitz also a nuncio from your blessedness he though he go up and down with much and varied exertion and omit nothing which could tend to restore the position of the cause throw into confusion by the rashness and pride of cajetan have difficulty even with the help of that very illustrious prince the elector frederick in at last bring about more than one familiar conference with me in these i again yield to your great name and be prepare to keep silence and to accept a my judge either the archbishop of treves or the bishop of naumburg and thus it be do and conclude while this be be do with good hope of success lo that other and great enemy of yours eccius rush in with hi leipsic disputation which he have undertake against carlstadt and have take up a new question concern the primacy of the pope turn hi arm unexpectedly against me and completely overthrow the plan for peace meanwhile charles miltitz be wait disputation be hold judge be be choose but no decision be arrive at and no wonder for by the falsehood pretence and art of eccius the whole business be bring into such thorough disorder confusion and fester soreness that whichever way the sentence might lean a great conflagration be sure to arise for he be seek not after truth but after hi own credit in this case too i omit nothing which it be right that i should do i confess that on this occasion no small part of the corruption of rome come to light but if there be any offence in this it be the fault of eccius who in take on him a burden beyond hi strength and in furiously aim at credit for himself unveil to the whole world the disgrace of rome here be that enemy of yours leo or rather of your court by hi example alone we may learn that an enemy be not more baneful than a flatterer for what do he bring about by hi flattery except evil which no king could have bring about at this day the name of the court of rome stink in the nostril of the world the papal authority be grow weak and it notorious ignorance be evil spoken of we should hear none of these thing if eccius have not disturb the plan of miltitz and myself for peace he feel this clearly enough himself in the indignation he show too late and in vain against the publication of my book he ought to have reflect on this at the time when he be all mad for renown and be seek in your cause nothing but hi own object and that with the great peril to you the foolish man hop that from fear of your name i should yield and keep silence for i do not think he presume on hi talent and learn now when he see that i be very confident and speak aloud he repent too late of hi rashness and seesif indeed he do see itthat there be one in heaven who resist the proud and humble the presumptuous since then we be bring about by this disputation nothing but the great confusion of the cause of rome charles miltitz for the third time address the father of the order assemble in and seek their advice for the settlement of the case a be now in a most troubled and perilous state since by the favour of god there be no hope of proceed against me by force some of the more noted of their number be send to me and beg me at least to show respect to your person and to vindicate in a humble letter both your innocence and my own they say that the affair be not a yet in a position of extreme hopelessness if leo x in hi inborn kindliness would put hi hand to it on this i who have always offer and wish for peace in order that i might devote myself to calmer and more useful pursuit and who for this very purpose have act with so much spirit and vehemence in order to put down by the strength and impetuosity of my word as well a of my feeling men whom i saw to be very far from equal to myselfi i say not only gladly yield but even accept it with joy and gratitude a the great kindness and benefit if you should think it right to satisfy my hope thus i come most bless father and in all abasement beseech you to put to your hand if it be possible and impose a curb to those flatterer who be enemy of peace while they pretend peace but there be no reason most bless father why any one should assume that i be to utter a recantation unless he prefer to involve the case in still great confusion moreover i can not bear with law for the interpretation of the word of god since the word of god which teach liberty in all other thing ought not to be bind save these two thing there be nothing which i be not able and most heartily willing to do or to suffer i hate contention i will challenge no one in return i wish not to be challenge but be challenge i will not be dumb in the cause of christ my master for your blessedness will be able by one short and easy word to call these controversy before you and suppress them and to impose silence and peace on both sidesa word which i have ever long to hear therefore leo my father beware of listen to those siren who make you out to be not simply a man but partly a god so that you can command and require whatever you will it will not happen so nor will you prevail you be the servant of servant and more than any other man in a most pitiable and perilous position let not those men deceive you who pretend that you be lord of the world who will not allow any one to be a christian without your authority who babble of your have power over heaven hell and purgatory these men be your enemy and be seek your soul to destroy it a isaiah say my people they that call thee bless be themselves deceive thee they be in error who raise you above council and the universal church they be in error who attribute to you alone the right of interpret scripture all these men be seek to set up their own impiety in the church under your name and ala satan have gain much through them in the time of your predecessor in brief trust not in any who exalt you but in those who humiliate you for this be the judgment of god he hath cast down the mighty from their seat and hath exalt the humble see how unlike christ be to hi successor though all will have it that they be hi vicar i fear that in truth very many of them have be in too serious a sense hi vicar for a vicar represent a prince who be absent now if a pontiff rule while christ be absent and do not dwell in hi heart what els be he but a vicar of christ and then what be that church but a multitude without christ what indeed be such a vicar but antichrist and an idol how much more rightly do the apostle speak who call themselves servant of a present christ not the vicar of an absent one perhaps i be shamelessly bold in seem to teach so great a head by whom all men ought to be teach and from whom a those plague of yours boast the throne of judge receive their sentence but i imitate st bernard in hi book concern consideration address to eugenius a book which ought to be know by heart by every pontiff i do this not from any desire to teach but a a duty from that simple and faithful solicitude which teach u to be anxious for all that be safe for our neighbour and do not allow consideration of worthiness or unworthiness to be entertain be intent only on the danger or advantage of other for since i know that your blessedness be drive and toss by the wave at rome so that the depth of the sea press on you with infinite peril and that you be labour under such a condition of misery that you need even the least help from any the least brother i do not seem to myself to be act unsuitably if i forget your majesty till i shall have fulfil the office of charity i will not flatter in so serious and perilous a matter and if in this you do not see that i be your friend and most thoroughly your subject there be one to see and judge in fine that i may not approach you emptyhanded bless father i bring with me this little treatise publish under your name a a good omen of the establishment of peace and of good hope by this you may perceive in what pursuit i should prefer and be able to occupy myself to more profit if i be allow or have be hitherto allow by your impious flatterer it be a small matter if you look to it exterior but unless i mistake it be a summary of the christian life put together in small compass if you apprehend it meaning i in my poverty have no other present to make you nor do you need anything els than to be enrich by a spiritual gift i commend myself to your paternity and blessedness whom may the lord jesus preserve for ever amen wittenberg th september concerning christian liberty christian faith have appear to many an easy thing nay not a few even reckon it among the social virtue a it be and this they do because they have not make proof of it experimentally and have never taste of what efficacy it be for it be not possible for any man to write well about it or to understand well what be rightly write who have not at some time taste of it spirit under the pressure of tribulation while he who have taste of it even to a very small extent can never write speak think or hear about it sufficiently for it be a living fountain spring up into eternal life a christ call it in john iv now though i can not boast of my abundance and though i know how poorly i be furnished yet i hope that after have be vex by various temptation i have attain some little drop of faith and that i can speak of this matter if not with more elegance certainly with more solidity than those literal and too subtle disputant who have hitherto discourse upon it without understand their own word that i may open then an easy way for the ignorantfor these alone i be try to servei first lay down these two proposition concern spiritual liberty and servitude a christian man be the most free lord of all and subject to none a christian man be the most dutiful servant of all and subject to every one although these statement appear contradictory yet when they be find to agree together they will make excellently for my purpose they be both the statement of paul himself who say though i be free from all men yet have i make myself servant unto all cor ix and owe no man anything but to love one another rom xiii now love be by it own nature dutiful and obedient to the beloved object thus even christ though lord of all thing be yet make of a woman make under the law at once free and a servant at once in the form of god and in the form of a servant let u examine the subject on a deep and less simple principle man be compose of a twofold nature a spiritual and a bodily a regard the spiritual nature which they name the soul he be call the spiritual inward new man a regard the bodily nature which they name the flesh he be call the fleshly outward old man the apostle speaks of this though our outward man perish yet the inward man be renew day by day cor iv the result of this diversity be that in the scripture oppose statement be make concern the same man the fact be that in the same man these two men be oppose to one another the flesh lusting against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh gal v we first approach the subject of the inward man that we may see by what mean a man become justified free and a true christian that be a spiritual new and inward man it be certain that absolutely none among outward thing under whatever name they may be reckon have any influence in produce christian righteousness or liberty nor on the other hand unrighteousness or slavery this can be show by an easy argument what can it profit the soul that the body should be in good condition free and full of life that it should eat drink and act accord to it pleasure when even the most impious slave of every kind of vice be prosperous in these matter again what harm can illhealth bondage hunger thirst or any other outward evil do to the soul when even the most pious of men and the free in the purity of their conscience be harass by these thing neither of these state of thing have to do with the liberty or the slavery of the soul and so it will profit nothing that the body should be adorn with sacred vestment or dwell in holy place or be occupy in sacred office or pray fast and abstain from certain meat or do whatever work can be do through the body and in the body something widely different will be necessary for the justification and liberty of the soul since the thing i have speak of can be do by any impious person and only hypocrite be produce by devotion to these thing on the other hand it will not at all injure the soul that the body should be clothe in profane raiment should dwell in profane place should eat and drink in the ordinary fashion should not pray aloud and should leave undone all the thing above mention which may be do by hypocrite and to cast everything aside even speculation meditation and whatever thing can be perform by the exertion of the soul itself be of no profit one thing and one alone be necessary for life justification and christian liberty and that be the most holy word of god the gospel of christ a he say i be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me shall not die eternally john xi and also if the son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed john viii and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god matt iv let u therefore hold it for certain and firmly establish that the soul can do without everything except the word of god without which none at all of it want be provide for but have the word it be rich and want for nothing since that be the word of life of truth of light of peace of justification of salvation of joy of liberty of wisdom of virtue of grace of glory and of every good thing it be on this account that the prophet in a whole psalm psalm cxix and in many other place sigh for and call upon the word of god with so many groanings and word again there be no more cruel stroke of the wrath of god than when he send a famine of hear hi word amos viii just a there be no great favour from him than the send forth of hi word a it be say he send hi word and heal them and deliver them from their destruction psalm cvii christ be send for no other office than that of the word and the order of apostle that of bishop and that of the whole body of the clergy have be call and institute for no object but the ministry of the word but you will ask what be this word and by what mean be it to be use since there be so many word of god i answer the apostle paul rom i explain what it be namely the gospel of god concern hi son incarnate suffering risen and glorify through the spirit the sanctifier to preach christ be to fee the soul to justify it to set it free and to save it if it believe the preaching for faith alone and the efficacious use of the word of god bring salvation if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raise him from the dead thou shalt be save rom x and again christ be the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth rom x and the just shall live by faith rom i for the word of god can not be receive and honour by any work but by faith alone hence it be clear that a the soul need the word alone for life and justification so it be justify by faith alone and not by any work for if it could be justify by any other mean it would have no need of the word nor consequently of faith but this faith can not consist at all with work that be if you imagine that you can be justify by those work whatever they be along with it for this would be to halt between two opinion to worship baal and to kiss the hand to him which be a very great iniquity a job say therefore when you begin to believe you learn at the same time that all that be in you be utterly guilty sinful and damnable accord to that say all have sin and come short of the glory of god rom iii and also there be none righteous no not one they be all go out of the way they be together become unprofitable there be none that doeth good no not one rom iii when you have learn this you will know that christ be necessary for you since he have suffer and rise again for you that believe on him you might by this faith become another man all your sin be remit and you be justify by the merit of another namely of christ alone since then this faith can reign only in the inward man a it be say with the heart man believeth unto righteousness rom x and since it alone justify it be evident that by no outward work or labour can the inward man be at all justified make free and save and that no work whatever have any relation to him and so on the other hand it be solely by impiety and incredulity of heart that he become guilty and a slave of sin deserve condemnation not by any outward sin or work therefore the first care of every christian ought to be to lay aside all reliance on work and strengthen hi faith alone more and more and by it grow in the knowledge not of work but of christ jesus who have suffer and rise again for him a peter teach peter v when he make no other work to be a christian one thus christ when the jew ask him what they should do that they might work the work of god reject the multitude of work with which he saw that they be puff up and command them one thing only say this be the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath send for him hath god the father seal john vi hence a right faith in christ be an incomparable treasure carry with it universal salvation and preserve from all evil a it be say he that believeth and be baptise shall be save but he that believeth not shall be damn mark xvi isaiah look to this treasure predict the consumption decree shall overflow with righteousness for the lord god of host shall make a consumption even determine verbum abbreviatum et consummans in the midst of the land isa x a if he say faith which be the brief and complete fulfilling of the law will fill those who believe with such righteousness that they will need nothing els for justification thus too paul say for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness rom x but you ask how it can be the fact that faith alone justifies and affords without work so great a treasure of good thing when so many work ceremony and law be prescribe to u in the scripture i answer before all thing bear in mind what i have say that faith alone without works justifies set free and save a i shall show more clearly below meanwhile it be to be note that the whole scripture of god be divide into two part precept and promise the precept certainly teach u what be good but what they teach be not forthwith do for they show u what we ought to do but do not give u the power to do it they be ordain however for the purpose of show man to himself that through them he may learn hi own impotence for good and may despair of hi own strength for this reason they be call the old testament and be so for example thou shalt not covet be a precept by which we be all convict of sin since no man can help covet whatever effort to the contrary he may make in order therefore that he may fulfil the precept and not covet he be constrain to despair of himself and to seek elsewhere and through another the help which he can not find in himself a it be say o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me be thine help hosea xiii now what be do by this one precept be do by all for all be equally impossible of fulfilment by u now when a man have through the precept be teach hi own impotence and become anxious by what mean he may satisfy the lawfor the law must be satisfy so that no jot or tittle of it may pass away otherwise he must be hopelessly condemnedthen be truly humble and bring to nothing in hi own eye he find in himself no resource for justification and salvation then come in that other part of scripture the promise of god which declare the glory of god and say if you wish to fulfil the law and a the law require not to covet lo believe in christ in whom be promise to you grace justification peace and liberty all these thing you shall have if you believe and shall be without them if you do not believe for what be impossible for you by all the work of the law which be many and yet useless you shall fulfil in an easy and summary way through faith because god the father have make everything to depend on faith so that whosoever have it have all thing and he who have it not have nothing for god hath conclude them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all rom xi thus the promise of god give that which the precept exact and fulfil what the law command so that all be of god alone both the precept and their fulfilment he alone command he alone also fulfil hence the promise of god belong to the new testament nay be the new testament now since these promise of god be word of holiness truth righteousness liberty and peace and be full of universal goodness the soul which cleave to them with a firm faith be so united to them nay thoroughly absorb by them that it not only partake in but be penetrate and saturate by all their virtue for if the touch of christ be heal how much more do that most tender spiritual touch nay absorption of the word communicate to the soul all that belong to the word in this way therefore the soul through faith alone without work be from the word of god justify sanctify endue with truth peace and liberty and fill full with every good thing and be truly make the child of god a it be say to them give he power to become the son of god even to them that believe on hi name john i from all this it be easy to understand why faith have such great power and why no good work nor even all good work put together can compare with it since no work can cleave to the word of god or be in the soul faith alone and the word reign in it and such a be the word such be the soul make by it just a iron expose to fire glow like fire on account of it union with the fire it be clear then that to a christian man hi faith suffices for everything and that he have no need of work for justification but if he have no need of work neither have he need of the law and if he have no need of the law he be certainly free from the law and the saying be true the law be not make for a righteous man tim i this be that christian liberty our faith the effect of which be not that we should be careless or lead a bad life but that no one should need the law or work for justification and salvation let u consider this a the first virtue of faith and let u look also to the second this also be an office of faith that it honour with the utmost veneration and the high reputation him in whom it believe inasmuch a it hold him to be truthful and worthy of belief for there be no honour like that reputation of truth and righteousness with which we honour him in whom we believe what high credit can we attribute to any one than truth and righteousness and absolute goodness on the other hand it be the great insult to brand any one with the reputation of falsehood and unrighteousness or to suspect him of these a we do when we disbelieve him thus the soul in firmly believe the promise of god hold him to be true and righteous and it can attribute to god no high glory than the credit of be so the high worship of god be to ascribe to him truth righteousness and whatever quality we must ascribe to one in whom we believe in do this the soul show itself prepared to do hi whole will in do this it hallow hi name and give itself up to be dealt with a it may please god for it cleave to hi promise and never doubt that he be true just and wise and will do dispose and provide for all thing in the best way be not such a soul in this it faith most obedient to god in all thing what commandment do there remain which have not be amply fulfil by such an obedience what fulfilment can be more full than universal obedience now this be not accomplish by work but by faith alone on the other hand what great rebellion impiety or insult to god can there be than not to believe hi promise what els be this than either to make god a liar or to doubt hi truththat be to attribute truth to ourselves but to god falsehood and levity in do this be not a man deny god and set himself up a an idol in hi own heart what then can work do in such a state of impiety profit u be they even angelic or apostolic work rightly hath god shut up all not in wrath nor in lust but in unbelief in order that those who pretend that they be fulfil the law by work of purity and benevolence which be social and human virtue may not presume that they will therefore be save but be include in the sin of unbelief may either seek mercy or be justly condemn but when god see that truth be ascribe to him and that in the faith of our heart he be honour with all the honour of which he be worthy then in return he honour u on account of that faith attribute to u truth and righteousness for faith do truth and righteousness in render to god what be hi and therefore in return god give glory to our righteousness it be true and righteous that god be true and righteous and to confess this and ascribe these attribute to him this it be to be true and righteous thus he say them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteem sam ii and so paul say that abraham faith be impute to him for righteousness because by it he give glory to god and that to u also for the same reason it shall be impute for righteousness if we believe rom iv the third incomparable grace of faith be this that it unite the soul to christ a the wife to the husband by which mystery a the apostle teach christ and the soul be make one flesh now if they be one flesh and if a true marriagenay by far the most perfect of all marriagesis accomplish between them for human marriage be but feeble type of this one great marriage then it follow that all they have become theirs in common a well good thing a evil thing so that whatsoever christ possess that the believe soul may take to itself and boast of a it own and whatever belongs to the soul that christ claim a hi if we compare these possession we shall see how inestimable be the gain christ be full of grace life and salvation the soul be full of sin death and condemnation let faith step in and then sin death and hell will belong to christ and grace life and salvation to the soul for if he be a husband he must need take to himself that which be hi wife and at the same time impart to hi wife that which be hi for in give her hi own body and himself how can he but give her all that be hi and in take to himself the body of hi wife how can he but take to himself all that be hers in this be display the delightful sight not only of communion but of a prosperous warfare of victory salvation and redemption for since christ be god and man and be such a person a neither have sin nor dy nor be condemn nay can not sin die or be condemn and since hi righteousness life and salvation be invincible eternal and almightywhen i say such a person by the weddingring of faith take a share in the sin death and hell of hi wife nay make them hi own and deal with them no otherwise than a if they be hi and a if he himself have sin and when he suffer dy and descends to hell that he may overcome all thing and since sin death and hell can not swallow him up they must needs be swallow up by him in stupendous conflict for hi righteousness rise above the sin of all men hi life be more powerful than all death hi salvation be more unconquerable than all hell thus the believing soul by the pledge of it faith in christ becomes free from all sin fearless of death safe from hell and endow with the eternal righteousness life and salvation of it husband christ thus he present to himself a glorious bride without spot or wrinkle cleanse her with the washing of water by the word that be by faith in the word of life righteousness and salvation thus he betroth her unto himself in faithfulness in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness and in mercy hosea ii who then can value highly enough these royal nuptials who can comprehend the rich of the glory of this grace christ that rich and pious husband take a a wife a needy and impious harlot redeem her from all her evil and supply her with all hi good thing it be impossible now that her sin should destroy her since they have be lay upon christ and swallow up in him and since she have in her husband christ a righteousness which she may claim a her own and which she can set up with confidence against all her sin against death and hell say if i have sin my christ in whom i believe have not sin all mine be hi and all hi be mine a it be write my beloved be mine and i be hi cant ii this be what paul say thanks be to god which giveth u the victory through our lord jesus christ victory over sin and death a he say the sting of death be sin and the strength of sin be the law cor xv from all this you will again understand why so much importance be attribute to faith so that it alone can fulfil the law and justify without any work for you see that the first commandment which say thou shalt worship one god only be fulfil by faith alone if you be nothing but good work from the sol of your foot to the crown of your head you would not be worship god nor fulfil the first commandment since it be impossible to worship god without ascribe to him the glory of truth and of universal goodness a it ought in truth to be ascribe now this be not do by work but only by faith of heart it be not by work but by believe that we glorify god and confess him to be true on this ground faith alone be the righteousness of a christian man and the fulfilling of all the commandment for to him who fulfil the first the task of fulfil all the rest be easy work since they be irrational thing can not glorify god although they may be do to the glory of god if faith be present but at present we be inquire not into the quality of the work do but into him who do them who glorify god and brings forth good work this be faith of heart the head and the substance of all our righteousness hence that be a blind and perilous doctrine which teach that the commandment be fulfil by work the commandment must have be fulfil previous to any good work and good work follow their fulfillment a we shall see but that we may have a wide view of that grace which our inner man have in christ we must know that in the old testament god sanctify to himself every firstborn male the birthright be of great value give a superiority over the rest by the double honour of priesthood and kingship for the firstborn brother be priest and lord of all the rest under this figure be foreshown christ the true and only firstborn of god the father and of the virgin mary and a true king and priest not in a fleshly and earthly sense for hi kingdom be not of this world it be in heavenly and spiritual thing that he reign and act as priest and these be righteousness truth wisdom peace salvation etc not but that all thing even those of earth and hell be subject to himfor otherwise how could he defend and save u from thembut it be not in these nor by these that hi kingdom stand so too hi priesthood do not consist in the outward display of vestment and gesture a do the human priesthood of aaron and our ecclesiastical priesthood at this day but in spiritual thing wherein in hi invisible office he intercede for u with god in heaven and there offer himself and perform all the duty of a priest a paul describe him to the hebrew under the figure of melchizedek nor do he only pray and intercede for u he also teach u inwardly in the spirit with the living teaching of hi spirit now these be the two special office of a priest a be figure to u in the case of fleshly priest by visible prayer and sermon a christ by hi birthright have obtain these two dignity so he impart and communicate them to every believer in him under that law of matrimony of which we have speak above by which all that be the husband be also the wife hence all we who believe on christ be king and priest in christ a it be say ye be a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praise of him who hath call you out of darkness into hi marvellous light peter ii these two thing stand thus first a regard kingship every christian be by faith so exalt above all thing that in spiritual power he be completely lord of all thing so that nothing whatever can do him any hurt yea all thing be subject to him and be compel to be subservient to hi salvation thus paul say all thing work together for good to them who be the call rom viii and also whether life or death or thing present or thing to come all be yours and ye be christ cor iii not that in the sense of corporeal power any one among christian have be appoint to possess and rule all thing accord to the mad and senseless idea of certain ecclesiastic that be the office of king prince and men upon earth in the experience of life we see that we be subject to all thing and suffer many thing even death yea the more of a christian any man be to so many the more evils suffering and death be he subject a we see in the first place in christ the firstborn and in all hi holy brother this be a spiritual power which rule in the midst of enemy and be powerful in the midst of distress and this be nothing els than that strength be make perfect in my weakness and that i can turn all thing to the profit of my salvation so that even the cross and death be compel to serve me and to work together for my salvation this be a lofty and eminent dignity a true and almighty dominion a spiritual empire in which there be nothing so good nothing so bad a not to work together for my good if only i believe and yet there be nothing of which i have needfor faith alone suffice for my salvationunless that in it faith may exercise the power and empire of it liberty this be the inestimable power and liberty of christian nor be we only king and the free of all men but also priests for ever a dignity far high than kingship because by that priesthood we be worthy to appear before god to pray for other and to teach one another mutually the thing which be of god for these be the duty of priest and they can not possibly be permit to any unbeliever christ have obtain for u this favour if we believe in him that just a we be hi brother and coheirs and fellowkings with him so we should be also fellowpriests with him and venture with confidence through the spirit of faith to come into the presence of god and cry abba father and to pray for one another and to do all thing which we see do and figure in the visible and corporeal office of priesthood but to an unbelieving person nothing render service or work for good he himself be in servitude to all thing and all thing turn out for evil to him because he use all thing in an impious way for hi own advantage and not for the glory of god and thus he be not a priest but a profane person whose prayer be turn into sin nor do he ever appear in the presence of god because god do not hear sinner who then can comprehend the loftiness of that christian dignity which by it royal power rule over all thing even over death life and sin and by it priestly glory be allpowerful with god since god do what he himself seek and wish a it be write he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them psalm cxlv this glory certainly can not be attain by any work but by faith only from these consideration any one may clearly see how a christian man be free from all thing so that he need no work in order to be justify and save but receive these gift in abundance from faith alone nay be he so foolish a to pretend to be justify set free saved and make a christian by mean of any good work he would immediately lose faith with all it benefit such folly be prettily represent in the fable where a dog run along in the water and carrying in hi mouth a real piece of meat be deceive by the reflection of the meat in the water and in try with open mouth to seize it lose the meat and it image at the same time here you will ask if all who be in the church be priest by what character be those whom we now call priest to be distinguish from the laity i reply by the use of these word priest clergy spiritual person ecclesiastic an injustice have be do since they have be transfer from the remain body of christian to those few who be now by hurtful custom call ecclesiastic for holy scripture make no distinction between them except that those who be now boastfully call pope bishop and lord it call minister servant and steward who be to serve the rest in the ministry of the word for teach the faith of christ and the liberty of believer for though it be true that we be all equally priests yet we can not nor if we could ought we all to minister and teach publicly thus paul say let a man so account of u a of the minister of christ and steward of the mystery of god cor iv this bad system have now issue in such a pompous display of power and such a terrible tyranny that no earthly government can be compare to it a if the laity be something els than christian through this perversion of thing it have happen that the knowledge of christian grace of faith of liberty and altogether of christ have utterly perish and have be succeed by an intolerable bondage to human work and law and accord to the lamentation of jeremiah we have become the slave of the vile men on earth who abuse our misery to all the disgraceful and ignominious purpose of their own will return to the subject which we have begin i think it be make clear by these consideration that it be not sufficient nor a christian course to preach the work life and word of christ in a historic manner a fact which it suffice to know a an example how to frame our life a do those who be now hold the best preacher and much less so to keep silence altogether on these thing and to teach in their stead the law of men and the decree of the father there be now not a few person who preach and read about christ with the object of move the human affection to sympathise with christ to indignation against the jew and other childish and womanish absurdity of that kind now preach ought to have the object of promote faith in him so that he may not only be christ but a christ for you and for me and that what be say of him and what he be call may work in u and this faith be produce and be maintain by preach why christ come what he have bring u and give to u and to what profit and advantage he be to be receive this be do when the christian liberty which we have from christ himself be rightly taught and we be show in what manner all we christian be king and priest and how we be lord of all thing and may be confident that whatever we do in the presence of god be please and acceptable to him whose heart would not rejoice in it inmost core at hear these thing whose heart on receive so great a consolation would not become sweet with the love of christ a love to which it can never attain by any law or work who can injure such a heart or make it afraid if the consciousness of sin or the horror of death rush in upon it it be prepared to hope in the lord and be fearless of such evil and undisturbed until it shall look down upon it enemy for it believe that the righteousness of christ be it own and that it sin be no longer it own but that of christ but on account of it faith in christ all it sin must need be swallow up from before the face of the righteousness of christ a i have say above it learn too with the apostle to scoff at death and sin and to say o death where be thy sting o grave where be thy victory the sting of death be sin and the strength of sin be the law but thanks be to god which giveth u the victory through our lord jesus christ cor xv for death be swallow up in victory not only the victory of christ but ours also since by faith it become ours and in it we too conquer let it suffice to say this concern the inner man and it liberty and concern that righteousness of faith which need neither law nor good work nay they be even hurtful to it if any one pretend to be justify by them and now let u turn to the other part to the outward man here we shall give an answer to all those who take offence at the word of faith and at what i have assert say if faith do everything and by itself suffices for justification why then be good work command be we then to take our ease and do no work content with faith not so impious men i reply not so that would indeed really be the case if we be thoroughly and completely inner and spiritual person but that will not happen until the last day when the dead shall be raise as long a we live in the flesh we be but begin and make advance in that which shall be complete in a future life on this account the apostle call that which we have in this life the firstfruits of the spirit rom viii in future we shall have the tenth and the fullness of the spirit to this part belong the fact i have state before that the christian be the servant of all and subject to all for in that part in which he be free he do no work but in that in which he be a servant he do all work let u see on what principle this be so although a i have say inwardly and accord to the spirit a man be amply enough justify by faith have all that he require to have except that this very faith and abundance ought to increase from day to day even till the future life still he remain in this mortal life upon earth in which it be necessary that he should rule hi own body and have intercourse with men here then work begin here he must not take hi ease here he must give heed to exercise hi body by fasting watching labour and other regular discipline so that it may be subdue to the spirit and obey and conform itself to the inner man and faith and not rebel against them nor hinder them as be it nature to do if it be not keep under for the inner man be conform to god and create after the image of god through faith rejoices and delight itself in christ in whom such blessing have be confer on it and hence have only this task before it to serve god with joy and for nought in free love but in do this he come into collision with that contrary will in hi own flesh which be strive to serve the world and to seek it own gratification this the spirit of faith can not and will not bear but apply itself with cheerfulness and zeal to keep it down and restrain it a paul say i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my member war against the law of my mind and bring me into captivity to the law of sin rom vii and again i keep under my body and bring it unto subjection l that by any mean when i have preach to other i myself should be a castaway cor ix and they that be christ have crucify the flesh with the affection and lust gal v these work however must not be do with any notion that by them a man can be justify before godfor faith which alone be righteousness before god will not bear with this false notionbut solely with this purpose that the body may be bring into subjection and be purify from it evil lust so that our eye may be turn only to purge away those lust for when the soul have be cleanse by faith and make to love god it would have all thing to be cleanse in like manner and especially it own body so that all thing might unite with it in the love and praise of god thus it come that from the requirement of hi own body a man can not take hi ease but be compel on it account to do many good work that he may bring it into subjection yet these work be not the mean of hi justification before god he do them out of disinterested love to the service of god look to no other end than to do what be wellpleasing to him whom he desire to obey most dutifully in all thing on this principle every man may easily instruct himself in what measure and with what distinction he ought to chasten hi own body he will fast watch and labour just as much a he see to suffice for keep down the wantonness and concupiscence of the body but those who pretend to be justify by work be look not to the mortification of their lust but only to the work themselves think that if they can accomplish a many work and a great one a possible all be well with them and they be justify sometimes they even injure their brain and extinguish nature or at least make it useless this be enormous folly and ignorance of christian life and faith when a man seek without faith to be justify and save by work to make what we have say more easily understood let u set it forth under a figure the work of a christian man who be justified and save by hi faith out of the pure and unbought mercy of god ought to be regard in the same light a would have be those of adam and eve in paradise and of all their posterity if they have not sin of them it be say the lord god take the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it gen ii now adam have be create by god just and righteous so that he could not have need to be justify and make righteous by keep the garden and working in it but that he might not be unemployed god give him the business of keep and cultivate paradise these would have indeed be work of perfect freedom be do for no object but that of please god and not in order to obtain justification which he already have to the full and which would have be innate in u all so it be with the work of a believer being by hi faith replace afresh in paradise and create anew he do not need work for hi justification but that he may not be idle but may exercise hi own body and preserve it hi work be to be do freely with the sole object of please god only we be not yet fully create anew in perfect faith and love these require to be increase not however through work but through themselves a bishop when he consecrate a church confirm child or performs any other duty of hi office be not consecrate a bishop by these work nay unless he have be previously consecrate a bishop not one of those work would have any validity they would be foolish childish and ridiculous thus a christian be consecrate by hi faith do good work but he be not by these work make a more sacred person or more a christian that be the effect of faith alone nay unless he be previously a believer and a christian none of hi work would have any value at all they would really be impious and damnable sin true then be these two saying good work do not make a good man but a good man do good work bad work do not make a bad man but a bad man do bad work thus it be always necessary that the substance or person should be good before any good work can be do and that good work should follow and proceed from a good person a christ say a good tree can not bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit matt vii now it be clear that the fruit do not bear the tree nor do the tree grow on the fruit but on the contrary the tree bear the fruit and the fruit grow on the tree a then tree must exist before their fruit and a the fruit do not make the tree either good or bad but on the contrary a tree of either kind produce fruit of the same kind so must first the person of the man be good or bad before he can do either a good or a bad work and hi work do not make him bad or good but he himself make hi work either bad or good we may see the same thing in all handicraft a bad or good house do not make a bad or good builder but a good or bad builder make a good or bad house and in general no work make the workman such a it be itself but the workman make the work such a he be himself such be the case too with the work of men such a the man himself be whether in faith or in unbelief such be hi work good if it be do in faith bad if in unbelief but the converse be not true that such a the work be such the man become in faith or in unbelief for a work do not make a believing man so neither do they make a justified man but faith a it make a man a believer and justify so also it make hi work good since then work justify no man but a man must be justify before he can do any good work it be most evident that it be faith alone which by the mere mercy of god through christ and by mean of hi word can worthily and sufficiently justify and save the person and that a christian man need no work no law for hi salvation for by faith he be free from all law and in perfect freedom do gratuitously all that he do seek nothing either of profit or of salvationsince by the grace of god he be already save and rich in all thing through hi faithbut solely that which be wellpleasing to god so too no good work can profit an unbeliever to justification and salvation and on the other hand no evil work make him an evil and condemn person but that unbelief which make the person and the tree bad make hi work evil and condemn wherefore when any man be make good or bad this do not arise from hi work but from hi faith or unbelief a the wise man say the beginning of sin be to fall away from god that be not to believe paul say he that cometh to god must believe heb xi and christ say the same thing either make the tree good and hi fruit good or els make the tree corrupt and hi fruit corrupt matt xii as much a to say he who wish to have good fruit will begin with the tree and plant a good one even so he who wish to do good work must begin not by work but by believe since it be this which make the person good for nothing make the person good but faith nor bad but unbelief it be certainly true that in the sight of men a man become good or evil by hi work but here become mean that it be thus show and recognise who be good or evil a christ say by their fruit ye shall know them matt vii but all this stop at appearance and external and in this matter very many deceive themselves when they presume to write and teach that we be to be justify by good work and meanwhile make no mention even of faith walking in their own way ever deceive and deceive go from bad to worse blind leader of the blind weary themselves with many work and yet never attain to true righteousness of whom paul say have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof ever learn and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth tim iii he then who do not wish to go astray with these blind one must look far than to the work of the law or the doctrine of work nay must turn away hi sight from work and look to the person and to the manner in which it may be justify now it be justified and save not by work or law but by the word of godthat be by the promise of hi graceso that the glory may be to the divine majesty which have save u who believe not by work of righteousness which we have do but accord to hi mercy by the word of hi grace from all this it be easy to perceive on what principle good work be to be cast aside or embrace and by what rule all teaching put forth concern work be to be understand for if work be bring forward a ground of justification and be do under the false persuasion that we can pretend to be justify by them they lay on u the yoke of necessity and extinguish liberty along with faith and by this very addition to their use they become no longer good but really worthy of condemnation for such work be not free but blaspheme the grace of god to which alone it belong to justify and save through faith work can not accomplish this and yet with impious presumption through our folly they take it on themselves to do so and thus break in with violence upon the office and glory of grace we do not then reject good work nay we embrace them and teach them in the high degree it be not on their own account that we condemn them but on account of this impious addition to them and the perverse notion of seek justification by them these thing cause them to be only good in outward show but in reality not good since by them men be deceive and deceive other like raven wolf in sheep clothe now this leviathan this pervert notion about work be invincible when sincere faith be want for those sanctified doer of work can not but hold it till faith which destroy it come and reign in the heart nature can not expel it by her own power nay can not even see it for what it be but consider it a a most holy will and when custom step in besides and strengthen this pravity of nature a have happen by mean of impious teacher then the evil be incurable and lead astray multitude to irreparable ruin therefore though it be good to preach and write about penitence confession and satisfaction yet if we stop there and do not go on to teach faith such teaching be without doubt deceitful and devilish for christ speaking by hi servant john not only say repent ye but add for the kingdom of heaven be at hand matt iii for not one word of god only but both should be preach new and old thing should be bring out of the treasury as well the voice of the law a the word of grace the voice of the law should be bring forward that men may be terrify and bring to a knowledge of their sin and thence be convert to penitence and to a good manner of life but we must not stop here that would be to wind only and not to bind up to strike and not to heal to kill and not to make alive to bring down to hell and not to bring back to humble and not to exalt therefore the word of grace and of the promised remission of sin must also be preach in order to teach and set up faith since without that word contrition penitence and all other duty be perform and teach in vain there still remain it be true preacher of repentance and grace but they do not explain the law and the promise of god to such an end and in such a spirit that men may learn whence repentance and grace be to come for repentance come from the law of god but faith or grace from the promise of god a it be say faith cometh by hear and hearing by the word of god rom x whence it come that a man when humble and bring to the knowledge of himself by the threatenings and terror of the law be console and raise up by faith in the divine promise thus weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning psalm xxx thus much we say concern work in general and also concern those which the christian practise with regard to hi own body lastly we will speak also of those work which he perform towards hi neighbour for man do not live for himself alone in this mortal body in order to work on it account but also for all men on earth nay he live only for other and not for himself for it be to this end that he bring hi own body into subjection that he may be able to serve other more sincerely and more freely a paul say none of u liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord rom xiv thus it be impossible that he should take hi ease in this life and not work for the good of hi neighbour since he must need speak act and converse among men just a christ be make in the likeness of men and find in fashion a a man and have hi conversation among men yet a christian have need of none of these thing for justification and salvation but in all hi work he ought to entertain this view and look only to this objectthat he may serve and be useful to other in all that he do have nothing before hi eye but the necessity and the advantage of hi neighbour thus the apostle command u to work with our own hand that we may have to give to those that need he might have say that we may support ourselves but he tell u to give to those that need it be the part of a christian to take care of hi own body for the very purpose that by it soundness and wellbeing he may be enable to labour and to acquire and preserve property for the aid of those who be in want that thus the strong member may serve the weak member and we may be child of god thoughtful and busy one for another bear one anothers burden and so fulfil the law of christ here be the truly christian life here be faith really work by love when a man apply himself with joy and love to the work of that free servitude in which he serve other voluntarily and for nought himself abundantly satisfy in the ful and rich of hi own faith thus when paul have teach the philippian how they have be make rich by that faith in christ in which they have obtain all thing he teach them far in these word if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowel and mercy fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded have the same love be of one accord of one mind let nothing be do through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other good than themselves look not every man on hi own thing but every man also on the thing of other phil ii in this we see clearly that the apostle lay down this rule for a christian life that all our work should be direct to the advantage of other since every christian have such abundance through hi faith that all hi other work and hi whole life remain over and above wherewith to serve and benefit hi neighbour of spontaneous goodwill to this end he bring forward christ a an example say let this mind be in you which be also in christ jesus who be in the form of god think it not robbery to be equal with god but make himself of no reputation and take upon him the form of a servant and be make in the likeness of men and be find in fashion a a man he humble himself and become obedient unto death phil ii this most wholesome saying of the apostle have be darken to u by men who totally misunderstand the expression form of god form of a servant fashion likeness of men have transfer them to the nature of godhead and manhood paul meaning be this christ when he be full of the form of god and abound in all good thing so that he have no need of work or suffering to be just and savedfor all these thing he have from the very beginningyet be not puff up with these thing and do not raise himself above u and arrogate to himself power over u though he might lawfully have do so but on the contrary so act in labour work suffering and die a to be like the rest of men and no otherwise than a man in fashion and in conduct a if he be in want of all thing and have nothing of the form of god and yet all this he do for our sake that he might serve u and that all the work he should do under that form of a servant might become ours thus a christian like christ hi head be full and in abundance through hi faith ought to be content with this form of god obtain by faith except that a i have say he ought to increase this faith till it be perfect for this faith be hi life justification and salvation preserve hi person itself and make it please to god and bestow on him all that christ have a i have say above and a paul affirm the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god gal ii though he be thus free from all work yet he ought to empty himself of this liberty take on him the form of a servant be make in the likeness of men be find in fashion a a man serve help and in every way act towards hi neighbour a he see that god through christ have act and be act towards him all this he should do freely and with regard to nothing but the good pleasure of god and he should reason thus lo my god without merit on my part of hi pure and free mercy have give to me an unworthy condemn and contemptible creature all the rich of justification and salvation in christ so that i no longer be in want of anything except of faith to believe that this be so for such a father then who have overwhelm me with these inestimable rich of hi why should i not freely cheerfully and with my whole heart and from voluntary zeal do all that i know will be please to him and acceptable in hi sight i will therefore give myself a a sort of christ to my neighbour a christ have give himself to me and will do nothing in this life except what i see will be needful advantageous and wholesome for my neighbour since by faith i abound in all good thing in christ thus from faith flow forth love and joy in the lord and from love a cheerful willing free spirit dispose to serve our neighbour voluntarily without take any account of gratitude or ingratitude praise or blame gain or loss it object be not to lay men under obligation nor do it distinguish between friend and enemy or look to gratitude or ingratitude but most freely and willingly spend itself and it good whether it lose them through ingratitude or gain goodwill for thus do it father distribute all thing to all men abundantly and freely make hi sun to rise upon the just and the unjust thus too the child do and endure nothing except from the free joy with which it delight through christ in god the giver of such great gift you see then that if we recognize those great and precious gift a peter say which have be give to u love be quickly diffuse in our heart through the spirit and by love we be make free joyful allpowerful active worker victor over all our tribulation servant to our neighbour and nevertheless lord of all thing but for those who do not recognise the good thing give to them through christ christ have be bear in vain such person walk by work and will never attain the taste and feeling of these great thing therefore just a our neighbour be in want and have need of our abundance so we too in the sight of god be in want and have need of hi mercy and a our heavenly father have freely help u in christ so ought we freely to help our neighbour by our body and work and each should become to other a sort of christ so that we may be mutually christ and that the same christ may be in all of u that be that we may be truly christian who then can comprehend the rich and glory of the christian life it can do all thing have all thing and be in want of nothing be lord over sin death and hell and at the same time be the obedient and useful servant of all but ala it be at this day unknown throughout the world it be neither preached nor sought after so that we be quite ignorant about our own name why we be and be call christian we be certainly call so from christ who be not absent but dwell among usprovided that be that we believe in him and be reciprocally and mutually one the christ of the other do to our neighbour a christ do to u but now in the doctrine of men we be teach only to seek after merit reward and thing which be already ours and we have make of christ a taskmaster far more severe than moses the blessed virgin beyond all other afford u an example of the same faith in that she be purify accord to the law of moses and like all other woman though she be bind by no such law and have no need of purification still she submit to the law voluntarily and of free love make herself like the rest of woman that she might not offend or throw contempt on them she be not justify by do this but be already justify she do it freely and gratuitously thus ought our work too to be do and not in order to be justify by them for be first justify by faith we ought to do all our work freely and cheerfully for the sake of other st paul circumcise hi disciple timothy not because he need circumcision for hi justification but that he might not offend or contemn those jew weak in the faith who have not yet be able to comprehend the liberty of faith on the other hand when they contemn liberty and urge that circumcision be necessary for justification he resist them and would not allow titus to be circumcise for a he would not offend or contemn any one weakness in faith but yield for the time to their will so again he would not have the liberty of faith offend or contemn by hardened selfjustifiers but walk in a middle path spar the weak for the time and always resist the harden that he might convert all to the liberty of faith on the same principle we ought to act receive those that be weak in the faith but boldly resist these harden teacher of work of whom we shall hereafter speak at more length christ also when hi disciple be ask for the tribute money ask of peter whether the child of a king be not free from tax peter agree to this yet jesus command him to go to the sea say lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast open hi mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee matt xvii this example be very much to our purpose for here christ call himself and hi disciple free men and child of a king in want of nothing and yet he voluntarily submit and pay the tax just a far then a this work be necessary or useful to christ for justification or salvation so far do all hi other work or those of hi disciple avail for justification they be really free and subsequent to justification and only do to serve other and set them an example such be the work which paul inculcate that christian should be subject to principality and power and ready to every good work titus iii not that they may be justify by these thingsfor they be already justify by faithbut that in liberty of spirit they may thus be the servant of other and subject to power obey their will out of gratuitous love such too ought to have be the work of all college monastery and priest every one do the work of hi own profession and state of life not in order to be justify by them but in order to bring hi own body into subjection a an example to other who themselves also need to keep under their body and also in order to accommodate himself to the will of other out of free love but we must always guard most carefully against any vain confidence or presumption of be justified gain merit or be save by these work this be the part of faith alone a i have so often say any man possess this knowledge may easily keep clear of danger among those innumerable command and precept of the pope of bishop of monastery of church of prince and of magistrate which some foolish pastor urge on u a be necessary for justification and salvation call them precept of the church when they be not so at all for the christian freeman will speak thus i will fast i will pray i will do this or that which be command me by men not a have any need of these thing for justification or salvation but that i may thus comply with the will of the pope of the bishop of such a community or such a magistrate or of my neighbour a an example to him for this cause i will do and suffer all thing just a christ do and suffer much more for me though he need not at all to do so on hi own account and make himself for my sake under the law when he be not under the law and although tyrant may do me violence or wrong in require obedience to these thing yet it will not hurt me to do them so long a they be not do against god from all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and faithful discrimination between all work and law and to know who be blind and foolish pastor and who be true and good one for whatsoever work be not direct to the sole end either of keep under the body or of do service to our neighbourprovided he require nothing contrary to the will of godis no good or christian work hence i greatly fear that at this day few or no college monasteries altar or ecclesiastical function be christian one and the same may be say of fast and special prayer to certain saint i fear that in all these nothing be be seek but what be already ours while we fancy that by these thing our sin be purge away and salvation be attain and thus utterly do away with christian liberty this come from ignorance of christian faith and liberty this ignorance and this crushing of liberty be diligently promote by the teaching of very many blind pastor who stir up and urge the people to a zeal for these thing praise them and puff them up with their indulgence but never teach faith now i would advise you if you have any wish to pray to fast or to make foundation in church a they call it to take care not to do so with the object of gain any advantage either temporal or eternal you will thus wrong your faith which alone bestow all thing on you and the increase of which either by work or by suffer be alone to be care for what you give give freely and without price that other may prosper and have increase from you and your goodness thus you will be a truly good man and a christian for what to you be your good and your work which be do over and above for the subjection of the body since you have abundance for yourself through your faith in which god have give you all thing we give this rule the good thing which we have from god ought to flow from one to another and become common to all so that every one of u may a it be put on hi neighbour and so behave towards him a if he be himself in hi place they flow and do flow from christ to u he put u on and act for u a if he himself be what we be from u they flow to those who have need of them so that my faith and righteousness ought to be lay down before god a a covering and intercession for the sin of my neighbour which i be to take on myself and so labour and endure servitude in them a if they be my own for thus have christ do for u this be true love and the genuine truth of christian life but only there be it true and genuine where there be true and genuine faith hence the apostle attribute to charity this quality that she seeketh not her own we conclude therefore that a christian man do not live in himself but in christ and in hi neighbour or els be no christian in christ by faith in hi neighbour by love by faith he be carry upwards above himself to god and by love he sink back below himself to hi neighbour still alwaysabiding in god and hi love a christ say verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angel of god ascend and descend upon the son of man john i thus much concern liberty which a you see be a true and spiritual liberty make our heart free from all sin law and commandment a paul say the law be not make for a righteous man tim i and one which surpass all other external liberty as far a heaven be above earth may christ make u to understand and preserve this liberty amen finally for the sake of those to whom nothing can be state so well but that they misunderstand and distort it we must add a word in case they can understand even that there be very many person who when they hear of this liberty of faith straightway turn it into an occasion of licence they think that everything be now lawful for them and do not choose to show themselves free men and christian in any other way than by their contempt and reprehension of ceremony of tradition of human law a if they be christian merely because they refuse to fast on stated day or eat flesh when other fast or omit the customary prayer scoff at the precept of men but utterly passing over all the rest that belong to the christian religion on the other hand they be most pertinaciously resist by those who strive after salvation solely by their observance of and reverence for ceremony a if they would be save merely because they fast on stated day or abstain from flesh or make formal prayer talk loudly of the precept of the church and of the father and not care a straw about those thing which belong to our genuine faith both these party be plainly culpable in that while they neglect matter which be of weight and necessary for salvation they contend noisily about such a be without weight and not necessary how much more rightly do the apostle paul teach u to walk in the middle path condemn either extreme and say let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth rom xiv you see here how the apostle blame those who not from religious feel but in mere contempt neglect and rail at ceremonial observance and teach them not to despise since this knowledge puffeth up again he teach the pertinacious upholder of these thing not to judge their opponent for neither party observe towards the other that charity which edifieth in this matter we must listen to scripture which teach u to turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left but to follow those right precept of the lord which rejoice the heart for just a a man be not righteous merely because he serve and be devote to work and ceremonial rite so neither will he be account righteous merely because he neglect and despise them it be not from work that we be set free by the faith of christ but from the belief in work that be from foolishly presume to seek justification through work faith redeem our conscience make them upright and preserve them since by it we recognise the truth that justification do not depend on our work although good work neither can nor ought to be absent just a we can not exist without food and drink and all the function of this mortal body still it be not on them that our justification be base but on faith and yet they ought not on that account to be despise or neglect thus in this world we be compel by the need of this bodily life but we be not hereby justified my kingdom be not hence nor of this world say christ but he do not say my kingdom be not here nor in this world paul too say though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh cor x and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god gal ii thus our doings life and be in work and ceremony be do from the necessity of this life and with the motive of govern our body but yet we be not justify by these thing but by the faith of the son of god the christian must therefore walk in the middle path and set these two class of men before hi eye he may meet with harden and obstinate ceremonialists who like deaf adder refuse to listen to the truth of liberty and cry up enjoin and urge on u their ceremony a if they could justify u without faith such be the jew of old who would not understand that they might act well these men we must resist do just the contrary to what they do and be bold to give them offence l by this impious notion of theirs they should deceive many along with themselves before the eye of these men it be expedient to eat flesh to break fast and to do in behalf of the liberty of faith thing which they hold to be the great sin we must say of them let them alone they be blind leader of the blind matt xv in this way paul also would not have titus circumcise though these men urge it and christ defend the apostle who have pluck ear of corn on the sabbath day and many like instance or els we may meet with simpleminded and ignorant person weak in the faith a the apostle call them who be a yet unable to apprehend that liberty of faith even if willing to do so these we must spare l they should be offend we must bear with their infirmity till they shall be more fully instruct for since these men do not act thus from harden malice but only from weakness of faith therefore in order to avoid give them offence we must keep fast and do other thing which they consider necessary this be require of u by charity which injure no one but serve all men it be not the fault of these person that they be weak but that of their pastor who by the snare and weapon of their own tradition have bring them into bondage and wound their soul when they ought to have be set free and heal by the teaching of faith and liberty thus the apostle say if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth cor viii and again i know and be persuade by the lord jesus that there be nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it be unclean it be evil for that man who eateth with offence rom xiv thus though we ought boldly to resist those teacher of tradition and though the law of the pontiff by which they make aggression on the people of god deserve sharp reproof yet we must spare the timid crowd who be hold captive by the law of those impious tyrant till they be set free fight vigorously against the wolf but on behalf of the sheep not against the sheep and this you may do by inveigh against the law and lawgiver and yet at the same time observe these law with the weak l they be offend until they shall themselves recognise the tyranny and understand their own liberty if you wish to use your liberty do it secretly a paul say hast thou faith have it to thyself before god rom xiv but take care not to use it in the presence of the weak on the other hand in the presence of tyrant and obstinate opposer use your liberty in their despite and with the utmost pertinacity that they too may understand that they be tyrant and their law useless for justification nay that they have no right to establish such law since then we can not live in this world without ceremony and work since the hot and inexperienced period of youth have need of be restrain and protect by such bond and since every one be bind to keep under hi own body by attention to these thing therefore the minister of christ must be prudent and faithful in so ruling and teach the people of christ in all these matter that no root of bitterness may spring up among them and so many be defile a paul warn the hebrew that be that they may not lose the faith and begin to be defile by a belief in work a the mean of justification this be a thing which easily happen and defile very many unless faith be constantly inculcate along with work it be impossible to avoid this evil when faith be pass over in silence and only the ordinance of men be teach a have be do hitherto by the pestilent impious and souldestroying tradition of our pontiff and opinion of our theologian an infinite number of soul have be draw down to hell by these snare so that you may recognise the work of antichrist in brief a poverty be imperil amid rich honesty amid business humility amid honour abstinence amid feast purity amid pleasure so be justification by faith imperil among ceremony solomon say can a man take fire in hi bosom and hi clothes not be burn prov vi and yet a we must live among rich business honour pleasures feasting so must we among ceremony that be among perils just a infant boy have the great need of be cherish in the bosom and by the care of girl that they may not die and yet when they be grow there be peril to their salvation in living among girl so inexperienced and fervid young men require to be keep in and restrain by the barrier of ceremony even be they of iron l their weak mind should rush headlong into vice and yet it would be death to them to persevere in believe that they can be justify by these thing they must rather be teach that they have be thus imprison not with the purpose of their be justify or gain merit in this way but in order that they might avoid wrongdoing and be more easily instruct in that righteousness which be by faith a thing which the headlong character of youth would not bear unless it be put under restraint hence in the christian life ceremony be to be no otherwise look upon than a builder and workman look upon those preparation for building or working which be not make with any view of be permanent or anything in themselves but only because without them there could be no building and no work when the structure be complete they be lay aside here you see that we do not contemn these preparation but set the high value on them a belief in them we do contemn because no one think that they constitute a real and permanent structure if any one be so manifestly out of hi sens a to have no other object in life but that of set up these preparation with all possible expense diligence and perseverance while he never think of the structure itself but please himself and make hi boast of these useless preparation and prop should we not all pity hi madness and think that at the cost thus throw away some great building might have be raise thus too we do not contemn work and ceremoniesnay we set the high value on them but we contemn the belief in work which no one should consider to constitute true righteousness a do those hypocrite who employ and throw away their whole life in the pursuit of work and yet never attain to that for the sake of which the work be do a the apostle say they be ever learn and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth tim iii they appear to wish to build they make preparation and yet they never do build and thus they continue in a show of godliness but never attain to it power meanwhile they please themselves with this zealous pursuit and even dare to judge all other whom they do not see adorned with such a glitter display of work while if they have be imbue with faith they might have do great thing for their own and other salvation at the same cost which they now waste in abuse of the gift of god but since human nature and natural reason a they call it be naturally superstitious and quick to believe that justification can be attain by any law or work propose to them and since nature be also exercise and confirm in the same view by the practice of all earthly lawgiver she can never of her own power free herself from this bondage to work and come to a recognition of the liberty of faith we have therefore need to pray that god will lead u and make u taught of god that be ready to learn from god and will himself a he have promise write hi law in our heart otherwise there be no hope for u for unless he himself teach u inwardly this wisdom hide in a mystery nature can not but condemn it and judge it to be heretical she take offence at it and it seem folly to her just a we see that it happen of old in the case of the prophet and apostle and just a blind and impious pontiff with their flatterer do now in my case and that of those who be like me upon whom together with ourselves may god at length have mercy and lift up the light of hi countenance upon them that we may know hi way upon earth and hi save health among all nation who be bless for evermore amen in the year of the lord mdxx
