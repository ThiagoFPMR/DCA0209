friend in this trifling affair that misunderstanding and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice and wickedness at all event the two latter be of less frequent occurrence in other respect i be very well off here solitude in this terrestrial paradise be a genial balm to my mind and the young spring cheer with it bounteous promise my oftentimes misgive heart every tree every bush be full of flower and one might wish himself transform into a butterfly to float about in this ocean of perfume and find hi whole existence in it the town itself be disagreeable but then all around you find an inexpressible beauty of nature this induce the late count m to lay out a garden on one of the sloping hill which here intersect each other with the most charming variety and form the most lovely valley the garden be simple and it be easy to perceive even upon your first entrance that the plan be not design by a scientific gardener but by a man who wish to give himself up here to the enjoyment of hi own sensitive heart many a tear have i already shed to the memory of it departed master in a summerhouse which be now reduce to ruin but be hi favourite resort and now be mine i shall soon be master of the place the gardener have become attach to me within the last few day and he will lose nothing thereby a wonderful serenity have take possession of my entire soul like these sweet morning of spring which i enjoy with my whole heart i be alone and feel the charm of existence in this spot which be create for the bliss of soul like mine i be so happy my dear friend so absorb in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence that i neglect my talent i should be incapable of draw a single stroke at the present moment and yet i feel that i never be a great artist than now when while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me and the meridian sun strike the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my tree and but a few stray gleam steal into the inner sanctuary i throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream and a i lie close to the earth a thousand unknown plant be notice by me when i hear the buzz of the little world among the stalk and grow familiar with the countless indescribable form of the insect and fly then i feel the presence of the almighty who form u in hi own image and the breath of that universal love which bear and sustain u a it float around u in an eternity of bliss and then my friend when darkness overspreads my eye and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb it power like the form of a beloved mistress then i often think with longing oh would i could describe these conception could impress upon paper all that be live so full and warm within me that it might be the mirror of my soul a my soul be the mirror of the infinite god o my friendbut it be too much for my strengthi sink under the weight of the splendour of these vision i know not whether some deceitful spirit haunt this spot or whether it be the warm celestial fancy in my own heart which make everything around me seem like paradise in front of the house be a fountaina fountain to which i be bind by a charm like melusina and her sister descend a gentle slope you come to an arch where some twenty step low down water of the clear crystal gush from the marble rock the narrow wall which enclose it above the tall tree which encircle the spot and the coolness of the place itselfeverything imparts a pleasant but sublime impression not a day pass on which i do not spend an hour there the young maiden come from the town to fetch waterinnocent and necessary employment and formerly the occupation of the daughter of king a i take my rest there the idea of the old patriarchal life be awaken around me i see them our old ancestor how they form their friendship and contract alliance at the fountainside and i feel how fountain and stream be guard by beneficent spirit he who be a stranger to these sensation have never really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the fatigue of a weary summer day you ask if you shall send me book my dear friend i beseech you for the love of god relieve me from such a yoke i need no more to be guide agitated heat my heart ferment sufficiently of itself i want strain to lull me and i find them to perfection in my homer often do i strive to allay the burning fever of my blood and you have never witness anything so unsteady so uncertain a my heart but need i confess this to you my dear friend who have so often endure the anguish of witness my sudden transition from sorrow to immoderate joy and from sweet melancholy to violent passion i treat my poor heart like a sick child and gratify it every fancy do not mention this again there be people who would censure me for it the common people of the place know me already and love me particularly the child when at first i associate with them and inquire in a friendly tone about their various trifle some fancy that i wish to ridicule them and turn from me in exceed illhumour i do not allow that circumstance to grieve me i only felt most keenly what i have often before observed person who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof from the common people a though they fear to lose their importance by the contact whilst wanton idler and such a be prone to bad joke affect to descend to their level only to make the poor people feel their impertinence all the more keenly i know very well that we be not all equal nor can be so but it be my opinion that he who avoid the common people in order not to lose their respect be as much to blame a a coward who hide himself from hi enemy because he fear defeat the other day i go to the fountain and find a young servantgirl who have set her pitcher on the low step and look around to see if one of her companion be approach to place it on her head i run down and look at her shall i help you pretty lass say i she blush deeply oh sir she exclaim no ceremony i reply she adjust her headgear and i help her she thank me and ascend the step i have make all sort of acquaintance but have a yet find no society i know not what attraction i possess for the people so many of them like me and attach themselves to me and then i feel sorry when the road we pursue together go only a short distance if you inquire what the people be like here i must answer the same a everywhere the human race be but a monotonous affair most of them labour the great part of their time for mere subsistence and the scanty portion of freedom which remain to them so trouble them that they use every exertion to get rid of it oh the destiny of man but they be a right good sort of people if i occasionally forget myself and take part in the innocent pleasure which be not yet forbid to the peasantry and enjoy myself for instance with genuine freedom and sincerity round a wellcovered table or arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely and so forth all this produce a good effect upon my disposition only i must forget that there lie dormant within me so many other quality which moulder uselessly and which i be oblige to keep carefully conceal ah this thought affect my spirit fearfully and yet to be misunderstood be the fate of the like of u alas that the friend of my youth be go ala that i ever know her i might say to myself you be a dreamer to seek what be not to be find here below but she have be mine i have possess that heart that noble soul in whose presence i seem to be more than i really be because i be all that i could be good heaven do then a single power of my soul remain unexercised in her presence could i not display to it full extent that mysterious feeling with which my heart embrace nature wa not our intercourse a perpetual web of the fine emotion of the keen wit the variety of which even in their very eccentricity bore the stamp of genius ala the few year by which she be my senior bring her to the grave before me never can i forget her firm mind or her heavenly patience a few day ago i meet a certain young v a frank open fellow with a most pleasing countenance he have just leave the university do not deem himself overwise but believe he know more than other people he have work hard a i can perceive from many circumstance and in short posse a large stock of information when he hear that i be draw a good deal and that i know greek two wonderful thing for this part of the country he come to see me and display hi whole store of learn from batteaux to wood from de pile to winkelmann he assure me he have read through the first part of sultzers theory and also possess a manuscript of heynes work on the study of the antique i allow it all to pass i have become acquaint also with a very worthy person the district judge a frank and openhearted man i be told it be a most delightful thing to see him in the midst of hi child of whom he have nine hi eldest daughter especially be highly spoken of he have invite me to go and see him and i intend to do so on the first opportunity he live at one of the royal huntinglodges which can be reach from here in an hour and a half by walk and which he obtain leave to inhabit after the loss of hi wife a it be so painful to him to reside in town and at the court there have also come in my way a few other original of a questionable sort who be in all respect undesirable and most intolerable in their demonstration of friendship goodbye this letter will please you it be quite historical that the life of man be but a dream many a man have surmise heretofore and i too be everywhere pursue by this feeling when i consider the narrow limit within which our active and inquiring faculty be confine when i see how all our energy be waste in provide for mere necessity which again have no further end than to prolong a wretched existence and then that all our satisfaction concern certain subject of investigation end in nothing good than a passive resignation whilst we amuse ourselves paint our prisonwalls with bright figure and brilliant landscapeswhen i consider all this wilhelm i be silent i examine my own be and find there a world but a world rather of imagination and dim desire than of distinctness and live power then everything swim before my sens and i smile and dream while pursue my way through the world all learn professor and doctor be agree that child do not comprehend the cause of their desire but that the grownup should wander about this earth like child without know whence they come or whither they go influenced a little by fixed motif but guide like them by biscuit sugarplum and the rodthis be what nobody be willing to acknowledge and yet i think it be palpable i know what you will say in reply for i be ready to admit that they be happy who like child amuse themselves with their plaything dress and undress their doll and attentively watch the cupboard where mamma have lock up her sweet thing and when at last they get a delicious morsel eat it greedily and exclaim more these be certainly happy being but other also be object of envy who dignify their paltry employment and sometimes even their passion with pompous title represent them to mankind a gigantic achievement perform for their welfare and glory but the man who humbly acknowledge the vanity of all this who observe with what pleasure the thriving citizen convert hi little garden into a paradise and how patiently even the poor man pursue hi weary way under hi burden and how all wish equally to behold the light of the sun a little longeryes such a man be at peace and create hi own world within himself and he be also happy because he be a man and then however limit hi sphere he still preserve in hi bosom the sweet feeling of liberty and know that he can quit hi prison whenever he like you know of old my way of settle anywhere of select a little cottage in some cosy spot and of put up in it with every inconvenience here too i have discover such a snug comfortable place which possess peculiar charm for me about a league from the town be a place call walheim the reader need not take the trouble to look for the place thus designate we have find it necessary to change the name give in the original it be delightfully situate on the side of a hill and by proceed along one of the footpath which lead out of the village you can have a view of the whole valley a good old woman live there who keep a small inn she sell wine beer and coffee and be cheerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age the chief charm of this spot consist in two lindentrees spread their enormous branch over the little green before the church which be entirely surround by peasant cottage barn and homestead i have seldom see a place so retired and peaceable and there often have my table and chair bring out from the little inn and drink my coffee there and read my homer accident bring me to the spot one fine afternoon and i find it perfectly desert everybody be in the field except a little boy about four year of age who be sit on the ground and hold between hi knee a child about six month old he press it to hi bosom with both arm which thus form a sort of armchair and notwithstanding the liveliness which sparkle in it black eye it remain perfectly still the sight charm me i sit down upon a plough opposite and sketch with great delight this little picture of brotherly tenderness i add the neighbouring hedge the barndoor and some broken cartwheel just a they happen to lie and i find in about an hour that i have make a very correct and interesting drawing without put in the slight thing of my own this confirm me in my resolution of adhere for the future entirely to nature she alone be inexhaustible and capable of form the great master much may be allege in favour of rule a much may be likewise advance in favour of the law of society an artist form upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad or disgust a a man who observe the law and obeys decorum can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour nor a decided villain but yet say what you will of rule they destroy the genuine feeling of nature as well a it true expression do not tell me that this be too hard that they only restrain and prune superfluous branch etc my good friend i will illustrate this by an analogy these thing resemble love a warmhearted youth become strongly attach to a maiden he spend every hour of the day in her company wear out hi health and lavish hi fortune to afford continual proof that he be wholly devote to her then come a man of the world a man of place and respectability and address him thus my good young friend love be natural but you must love within bound divide your time devote a portion to business and give the hour of recreation to your mistress calculate your fortune and out of the superfluity you may make her a present only not too oftenon her birthday and such occasion pursue this advice he may become a useful member of society and i should advise every prince to give him an appointment but it be all up with hi love and with hi genius if he be an artist o my friend why be it that the torrent of genius so seldom burst forth so seldom roll in fullflowing stream overwhelm your astounded soul because on either side of this stream cold and respectable person have take up their abode and forsooth their summerhouse and tulipbeds would suffer from the torrent wherefore they dig trench and raise embankment betimes in order to avert the impending danger i find i have fall into rapture declamation and simile and have forget in consequence to tell you what become of the child absorbed in my artistic contemplation which i briefly describe in my letter of yesterday i continue sit on the plough for two hour toward even a young woman with a basket on her arm come run toward the child who have not move all that time she exclaim from a distance you be a good boy philip she give me greet i return it rise and approach her i inquire if she be the mother of those pretty child yes she say and give the eldest a piece of bread she take the little one in her arm and kiss it with a mother tenderness i leave my child in philip care she say whilst i go into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheaten bread some sugar and an earthen pot i saw the various article in the basket from which the cover have fall i shall make some broth tonight for my little han which be the name of the young that wild fellow the big one break my pot yesterday whilst he be scramble with philip for what remain of the content i inquire for the eldest and she have scarcely time to tell me that he be drive a couple of geese home from the meadow when he run up and hand philip an osiertwig i talk a little longer with the woman and find that she be the daughter of the schoolmaster and that her husband be go on a journey into switzerland for some money a relation have leave him they want to cheat him she say and would not answer hi letter so he be go there himself i hope he have meet with no accident a i have hear nothing of him since hi departure i leave the woman with regret give each of the child a kreutzer with an additional one for the young to buy some wheaten bread for hi broth when she go to town next and so we part i assure you my dear friend when my thought be all in tumult the sight of such a creature a this tranquillise my disturbed mind she move in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her existence she supply her want from day to day and when she see the leaf fall they raise no other idea in her mind than that winter be approach since that time i have go out there frequently the child have become quite familiar with me and each get a lump of sugar when i drink my coffee and they share my milk and bread and butter in the evening they always receive their kreutzer on sunday for the good woman have order to give it to them when i do not go there after even service they be quite at home with me tell me everything and i be particularly amuse with observe their temper and the simplicity of their behaviour when some of the other village child be assemble with them it have give me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of the mother lest a she say they should inconvenience the gentleman what i have lately say of painting be equally true with respect to poetry it be only necessary for u to know what be really excellent and venture to give it expression and that be say much in few word today i have have a scene which if literally relate would make the most beautiful idyl in the world but why should i talk of poetry and scene and idyl can we never take pleasure in nature without have recourse to art if you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction you will be sadly mistake it relate merely to a peasantlad who have excite in me the warm interest a usual i shall tell my story badly and you a usual will think me extravagant it be walheim once morealways walheimwhich produce these wonderful phenomenon a party have assemble outside the house under the lindentrees to drink coffee the company do not exactly please me and under one pretext or another i linger behind a peasant come from an adjoining house and set to work arrange some part of the same plough which i have lately sketch hi appearance please me and i speak to him inquire about hi circumstance make hi acquaintance and a be my wont with person of that class be soon admit into hi confidence he say he be in the service of a young widow who set great store by him he speak so much of hi mistress and praise her so extravagantly that i could soon see he be desperately in love with her she be no longer young he say and she be treat so badly by her former husband that she do not mean to marry again from hi account it be so evident what incomparable charm she possess for him and how ardently he wish she would select him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband misconduct that i should have to repeat hi own word in order to describe the depth of the poor fellow attachment truth and devotion it would in fact require the gift of a great poet to convey the expression of hi feature the harmony of hi voice and the heavenly fire of hi eye no word can portray the tenderness of hi every movement and of every feature no effort of mine could do justice to the scene hi alarm l i should misconceive hi position with regard to hi mistress or question the propriety of her conduct touch me particularly the charm manner with which he describe her form and person which without possess the grace of youth won and attach him to her be inexpressible and must be leave to the imagination i have never in my life witness or fancy or conceive the possibility of such intense devotion such ardent affection unite with so much purity do not blame me if i say that the recollection of this innocence and truth be deeply impressed upon my very soul that this picture of fidelity and tenderness haunt me everywhere and that my own heart a though enkindle by the flame glow and burn within me i mean now to try and see her as soon a i can or perhaps on second thought i have well not it be well i should behold her through the eye of her lover to my sight perhaps she would not appear a she now stand before me and why should i destroy so sweet a picture why do i not write to you you lay claim to learn and ask such a question you should have guess that i be wellthat be to sayin a word i have make an acquaintance who have win my heart i havei know not to give you a regular account of the manner in which i have become acquaint with the most amiable of woman would be a difficult task i be a happy and contented mortal but a poor historian an angel nonsense everybody so describes hi mistress and yet i find it impossible to tell you how perfect she be or why she be so perfect suffice it to say she have captivate all my sens so much simplicity with so much understandingso mild and yet so resolutea mind so placid and a life so active but all this be ugly balderdash which express not a single character nor feature some other timebut no not some other time now this very instant will i tell you all about it now or never well between ourselves since i commence my letter i have be three time on the point of throw down my pen of order my horse and rid out and yet i vow this morning that i would not ride today and yet every moment i be rush to the window to see how high the sun be i could not restrain myselfgo to her i must i have just return wilhelm and whilst i be take supper i will write to you what a delight it be for my soul to see her in the midst of her dear beautiful childreneight brother and sister but if i proceed thus you will be no wiser at the end of my letter than you be at the begin attendthen and i will compel myself to give you the detail i mention to you the other day that i have become acquaint with s the district judge and that he have invite me to go and visit him in hi retirement or rather in hi little kingdom but i neglect go and perhaps should never have go if chance have not discover to me the treasure which lay conceal in that retire spot some of our young people have propose give a ball in the country at which i consent to be present i offer my hand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable but rather commonplace sort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood and it be agree that i should engage a carriage and call upon charlotte with my partner and her aunt to convey them to the ball my companion inform me a we drive along through the park to the huntinglodge that i should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady take care add the aunt that you do not lose your heart why say i because she be already engage to a very worthy man she reply who be go to settle hi affair upon the death of hi father and will succeed to a very considerable inheritance this information possess no interest for me when we arrive at the gate the sun be set behind the top of the mountain the atmosphere be heavy and the lady express their fear of an approach storm a mass of low black cloud be gather in the horizon i relieve their anxiety by pretend to be weatherwise although i myself have some apprehension l our pleasure should be interrupt i alight and a maid come to the door and request u to wait a moment for her mistress i walk across the court to a wellbuilt house and ascend the flight of step in front open the door and saw before me the most charming spectacle i have ever witness six child from eleven to two year old be run about the hall and surround a lady of middle height with a lovely figure dress in a robe of simple white trim with pink ribbon she be hold a rye loaf in her hand and be cut slice for the little one all around in proportion to their age and appetite she perform her task in a graceful and affectionate manner each claimant await hi turn with outstretched hand and boisterously shout hi thanks some of them run away at once to enjoy their evening meal whilst other of a gentler disposition retire to the courtyard to see the stranger and to survey the carriage in which their charlotte be to drive away pray forgive me for give you the trouble to come for me and for keep the lady wait but dress and arrange some household duty before i leave have make me forget my children supper and they do not like to take it from any one but me i utter some indifferent compliment but my whole soul be absorb by her air her voice her manner and i have scarcely recover myself when she run into her room to fetch her glove and fan the young one throw inquire glance at me from a distance whilst i approach the young a most delicious little creature he draw back and charlotte enter at the very moment say louis shake hand with your cousin the little fellow obey willingly and i could not resist give him a hearty kiss notwithstanding hi rather dirty face cousin say i to charlotte a i hand her down do you think i deserve the happiness of be relate to you she reply with a ready smile oh i have such a number of cousin that i should be sorry if you be the most undeserving of them in take leave she desire her next sister sophy a girl about eleven year old to take great care of the child and to say goodbye to papa for her when he come home from hi ride she enjoin to the little one to obey their sister sophy a they would herself upon which some promise that they would but a little fairhaired girl about six year old look discontented and say but sophy be not you charlotte and we like you best the two eldest boy have clamber up the carriage and at my request she permit them to accompany u a little way through the forest upon their promising to sit very still and hold fast we be hardly seat and the lady have scarcely exchange compliment make the usual remark upon each other dress and upon the company they expect to meet when charlotte stop the carriage and make her brother get down they insist upon kiss her hand once more which the eldest do with all the tenderness of a youth of fifteen but the other in a light and more careless manner she desire them again to give her love to the child and we drive off the aunt inquire of charlotte whether she have finish the book she have last send her no say charlotte i do not like it you can have it again and the one before be not much good i be surprise upon ask the title to hear that it be we feel oblige to suppress the passage in the letter to prevent any one from feel aggrieve although no author need pay much attention to the opinion of a mere girl or that of an unsteady young man i find penetration and character in everything she say every expression seem to brighten her feature with new charmswith new ray of geniuswhich unfold by degree a she felt herself understood when i be young she observe i love nothing so much a romance nothing could equal my delight when on some holiday i could settle down quietly in a corner and enter with my whole heart and soul into the joy or sorrow of some fictitious leonora i do not deny that they even possess some charm for me yet but i read so seldom that i prefer book suit exactly to my taste and i like those author best whose scene describe my own situation in lifeand the friend who be about me whose story touch me with interest from resemble my own homely existencewhich without be absolutely paradise be on the whole a source of indescribable happiness i endeavour to conceal the emotion which these word occasion but it be of slight avail for when she have express so truly her opinion of the vicar of wakefield and of other work the name of which i omit though the name be omit yet the author mention deserve charlotte approbation and will feel it in their heart when they read this passage it concern no other person i could no longer contain myself but give full utterance to what i think of it and it be not until charlotte have address herself to the two other lady that i remember their presence and observe them sit mute with astonishment the aunt look at me several time with an air of raillery which however i do not at all mind we talk of the pleasure of dance if it be a fault to love it say charlotte i be ready to confess that i prize it above all other amusement if anything disturbs me i go to the piano play an air to which i have dance and all go right again directly you who know me can fancy how steadfastly i gaze upon her rich dark eye during these remark how my very soul gloat over her warm lip and fresh glowing cheek how i become quite lose in the delightful meaning of her word so much so that i scarcely hear the actual expression in short i alight from the carriage like a person in a dream and be so lose to the dim world around me that i scarcely hear the music which resound from the illuminated ballroom the two messrs andran and a certain n n i can not trouble myself with the name who be the aunt and charlottes partner receive u at the carriagedoor and take possession of their lady whilst i follow with mine we commence with a minuet i lead out one lady after another and precisely those who be the most disagreeable could not bring themselves to leave off charlotte and her partner begin an english country dance and you must imagine my delight when it be their turn to dance the figure with u you should see charlotte dance she dance with her whole heart and soul her figure be all harmony elegance and grace a if she be conscious of nothing els and have no other think or feeling and doubtless for the moment every other sensation be extinct she be engage for the second country dance but promise me the third and assure me with the most agreeable freedom that she be very fond of waltz it be the custom here she say for the previous partner to waltz together but my partner be an indifferent waltzer and will feel delighted if i save him the trouble your partner be not allow to waltz and indeed be equally incapable but i observe during the country dance that you waltz well so if you will waltz with me i beg you would propose it to my partner and i will propose it to yours we agree and it be arrange that our partner should mutually entertain each other we set off and at first delighted ourselves with the usual graceful motion of the arm with what grace with what ease she move when the waltz commence and the dancer whirl around each other in the giddy maze there be some confusion owe to the incapacity of some of the dancer we judiciously remain still allow the other to weary themselves and when the awkward dancer have withdraw we join in and keep it up famously together with one other coupleandran and hi partner never do i dance more lightly i felt myself more than mortal hold this lovely of creature in my arm fly with her as rapidly a the wind till i lose sight of every other object and o wilhelm i vow at that moment that a maiden whom i love or for whom i felt the slight attachment never never should waltz with any one els but with me if i go to perdition for ityou will understand this we take a few turn in the room to recover our breath charlotte sit down and felt refresh by partake of some orange which i have have securedthe only one that have be leave but at every slice which from politeness she offer to her neighbour i felt a though a dagger go through my heart we be the second couple in the third country dance a we be go down and heaven know with what ecstasy i gaze at her arm and eye beam with the sweet feeling of pure and genuine enjoyment we pass a lady whom i have notice for her charming expression of countenance although she be no long young she look at charlotte with a smile then hold up her finger in a threatening attitude repeat twice in a very significant tone of voice the name of albert who be albert say i to charlotte if it be not impertinent to ask she be about to answer when we be oblige to separate in order to execute a figure in the dance and a we cross over again in front of each other i perceive she look somewhat pensive why need i conceal it from you she say a she give me her hand for the promenade albert be a worthy man to whom i be engage now there be nothing new to me in this for the girl have tell me of it on the way but it be so far new that i have not think of it in connection with her whom in so short a time i have learn to prize so highly enough i become confused get out in the figure and occasion general confusion so that it require all charlotte presence of mind to set me right by pull and push me into my proper place the dance be not yet finish when the lightning which have for some time be see in the horizon and which i have assert to proceed entirely from heat grow more violent and the thunder be hear above the music when any distress or terror surprise u in the midst of our amusement it naturally make a deep impression than at other time either because the contrast make u more keenly susceptible or rather perhaps because our sens be then more open to impression and the shock be consequently strong to this cause i must ascribe the fright and shriek of the lady one sagaciously sit down in a corner with her back to the window and hold her finger to her ear a second knelt down before her and hide her face in her lap a third threw herself between them and embrace her sister with a thousand tear some insist on go home other unconscious of their action want sufficient presence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young partner who seek to direct to themselves those sigh which the lip of our agitated beauty intend for heaven some of the gentleman have go downstairs to smoke a quiet cigar and the rest of the company gladly embrace a happy suggestion of the hostess to retire into another room which be provide with shutter and curtain we have hardly get there when charlotte place the chair in a circle and when the company have sit down in compliance with her request she forthwith propose a round game i notice some of the company prepare their mouth and draw themselves up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit let u play at counting say charlotte now pay attention i shall go round the circle from right to leave and each person be to count one after the other the number that come to him and must count fast whoever stop or mistake be to have a box on the ear and so on till we have count a thousand it be delightful to see the fun she go round the circle with upraised arm one say the first two the second three the third and so on till charlotte go faster and faster one make a mistake instantly a box on the ear and amid the laughter that ensue come another box and so on faster and faster i myself come in for two i fancy they be hard than the rest and felt quite delight a general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long before we have count as far a a thousand the party break up into little separate knot the storm have cease and i follow charlotte into the ballroom on the way she say the game banish their fear of the storm i could make no reply i myself she continue be as much frighten a any of them but by affect courage to keep up the spirit of the other i forget my apprehension we go to the window it be still thunder at a distance a soft rain be pour down over the country and fill the air around u with delicious odour charlotte lean forward on her arm her eye wander over the scene she raise them to the sky and then turn them upon me they be moisten with tear she place her hand on mine and say klopstock at once i remember the magnificent ode which be in her thought i felt oppress with the weight of my sensation and sank under them it be more than i could bear i bent over her hand kiss it in a stream of delicious tear and again look up to her eye divine klopstock why didst thou not see thy apotheosis in those eye and thy name so often profane would that i never hear it repeat i no longer remember where i stop in my narrative i only know it be two in the morning when i go to bed and if you have be with me that i might have talk instead of write to you i should in all probability have keep you up till daylight i think i have not yet relate what happen a we ride home from the ball nor have i time to tell you now it be a most magnificent sunrise the whole country be refresh and the rain fell drop by drop from the tree in the forest our companion be asleep charlotte ask me if i do not wish to sleep also and beg of me not to make any ceremony on her account look steadfastly at her i answer as long a i see those eye open there be no fear of my fall asleep we both continue awake till we reach her door the maid open it softly and assure her in answer to her inquiry that her father and the child be well and still sleep i leave her ask permission to visit her in the course of the day she consent and i go and since that time sun moon and star may pursue their course i know not whether it be day or night the whole world be nothing to me my day be as happy a those reserve by god for hi elect and whatever be my fate hereafter i can never say that i have not taste joythe pure joy of life you know walheim i be now completely settle there in that spot i be only half a league from charlotte and there i enjoy myself and taste all the pleasure which can fall to the lot of man little do i imagine when i select walheim for my pedestrian excursion that all heaven lay so near it how often in my wandering from the hillside or from the meadow across the river have i behold this huntinglodge which now contain within it all the joy of my heart i have often my dear wilhelm reflect on the eagerness men feel to wander and make new discovery and upon that secret impulse which afterward incline them to return to their narrow circle conform to the law of custom and embarrass themselves no longer with what pass around them it be so strange how when i come here first and gaze upon that lovely valley from the hillside i felt charm with the entire scene surround me the little wood oppositehow delightful to sit under it shade how fine the view from that point of rock then that delightful chain of hill and the exquisite valley at their foot could i but wander and lose myself amongst them i go and return without find what i wish distance my friend be like futurity a dim vastness be spread before our soul the perception of our mind be as obscure a those of our vision and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole be that it may be fill with the complete and perfect bliss of one glorious emotion but ala when we have attain our object when the distant there become the present here all be change we be a poor and circumscribe a ever and our soul still languish for unattainable happiness so do the restless traveller pant for hi native soil and find in hi own cottage in the arm of hi wife in the affection of hi child and in the labour necessary for their support that happiness which he have seek in vain through the wide world when in the morning at sunrise i go out to walheim and with my own hand gather in the garden the pea which be to serve for my dinner when i sit down to shell them and read my homer during the interval and then select a saucepan from the kitchen fetch my own butter put my mess on the fire cover it up and sit down to stir it a occasion require i figure to myself the illustrious suitor of penelope kill dressing and prepare their own ox and swine nothing fill me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than those trait of patriarchal life which thank heaven i can imitate without affectation happy be it indeed for me that my heart be capable of feel the same simple and innocent pleasure a the peasant whose table be cover with food of hi own rearing and who not only enjoy hi meal but remembers with delight the happy day and sunny morning when he plant it the soft evening when he water it and the pleasure he experience in watch it daily growth the day before yesterday the physician come from the town to pay a visit to the judge he find me on the floor playing with charlotte child some of them be scramble over me and other romp with me and a i catch and tickle them they make a great noise the doctor be a formal sort of personage he adjust the plait of hi ruffle and continually settle hi frill whilst he be talk to you and he think my conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man i could perceive this by hi countenance but i do not suffer myself to be disturb i allow him to continue hi wise conversation whilst i rebuild the children card house for them as fast a they throw them down he go about the town afterward complain that the judge child be spoil enough before but that now werther be completely ruin them yes my dear wilhelm nothing on this earth affect my heart so much a child when i look on at their doings when i mark in the little creatures the seed of all those virtue and quality which they will one day find so indispensable when i behold in the obstinate all the future firmness and constancy of a noble character in the capricious that levity and gaiety of temper which will carry them lightly over the danger and trouble of life their whole nature simple and unpollutedthen i call to mind the golden word of the great teacher of mankind unless ye become like one of these and now my friend these child who be our equal whom we ought to consider a our model we treat them a though they be our subject they be allow no will of their own and have we then none ourselves whence come our exclusive right be it because we be old and more experienced great god from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great child and little child and no other and thy son have long since declare which afford thee great pleasure but they believe in him and hear him notthat too be an old story and they train their child after their own image etc adieu wilhelm i will not further bewilder myself with this subject the consolation charlotte can bring to an invalid i experience from my own heart which suffer more from her absence than many a poor creature linger on a bed of sickness she be go to spend a few day in the town with a very worthy woman who be give over by the physician and wish to have charlotte near her in her last moment i accompany her last week on a visit to the vicar of s a small village in the mountain about a league hence we arrive about four oclock charlotte have take her little sister with her when we enter the vicarage court we find the good old man sit on a bench before the door under the shade of two large walnuttrees at the sight of charlotte he seem to gain new life rise forget hi stick and venture to walk toward her she run to him and make him sit down again then place herself by hi side she give him a number of message from her father and then catch up hi young child a dirty ugly little thing the joy of hi old age and kiss it i wish you could have witness her attention to this old manhow she raise her voice on account of hi deafness how she tell him of healthy young people who have be carry off when it be least expect praise the virtue of carlsbad and commend hi determination to spend the ensue summer there and assure him that he look well and strong than he do when she saw him last i in the meantime pay attention to hi good lady the old man seem quite in spirit and a i could not help admire the beauty of the walnuttrees which form such an agreeable shade over our head he begin though with some little difficulty to tell u their history a to the old say he we do not know who plant itsome say one clergyman and some another but the young one there behind u be exactly the age of my wife fifty year old next october her father plant it in the morning and in the evening she come into the world my wife father be my predecessor here and i can not tell you how fond he be of that tree and it be fully as dear to me under the shade of that very tree upon a log of wood my wife be seat knit when i a poor student come into this court for the first time just seven and twenty year ago charlotte inquire for hi daughter he say she be go with herr schmidt to the meadow and be with the haymaker the old man then resume hi story and tell u how hi predecessor have take a fancy to him a have hi daughter likewise and how he have become first hi curate and subsequently hi successor he have scarcely finish hi story when hi daughter return through the garden accompany by the abovementioned herr schmidt she welcome charlotte affectionately and i confess i be much take with her appearance she be a livelylooking goodhumoured brunette quite competent to amuse one for a short time in the country her lover for such herr schmidt evidently appear to be be a polite reserve personage and would not join our conversation notwithstanding all charlotte endeavour to draw him out i be much annoy at observe by hi countenance that hi silence do not arise from want of talent but from caprice and illhumour this subsequently become very evident when we set out to take a walk and frederica join charlotte with whom i be talk the worthy gentleman face which be naturally rather sombre become so dark and angry that charlotte be oblige to touch my arm and remind me that i be talk too much to frederica nothing distress me more than to see men torment each other particularly when in the flower of their age in the very season of pleasure they waste their few short day of sunshine in quarrel and dispute and only perceive their error when it be too late to repair it this think dwelt upon my mind and in the evening when we return to the vicar and be sit round the table with our bread end milk the conversation turn on the joy and sorrow of the world i could not resist the temptation to inveigh bitterly against illhumour we be apt say i to complain butwith very little cause that our happy day be few and our evil day many if our heart be always dispose to receive the benefit heaven send u we should acquire strength to support evil when it come but observe the vicar wife we can not always command our temper so much depend upon the constitution when the body suffer the mind be ill at ease i acknowledge that i continue but we must consider such a disposition in the light of a disease and inquire whether there be no remedy for it i should be glad to hear one say charlotte at least i think very much depend upon ourselves i know it be so with me when anything annoy me and disturb my temper i hasten into the garden hum a couple of country dance and it be all right with me directly that be what i mean i reply illhumour resembles indolence it be natural to u but if once we have courage to exert ourselves we find our work run fresh from our hand and we experience in the activity from which we shrink a real enjoyment frederica listen very attentively and the young man object that we be not master of ourselves and still less so of our feeling the question be about a disagreeable feeling i add from which every one would willingly escape but none know their own power without trial invalid be glad to consult physician and submit to the most scrupulous regimen the most nauseous medicine in order to recover their health i observe that the good old man incline hi head and exert himself to hear our discourse so i raise my voice and address myself directly to him we preach against a great many crime i observe but i never remember a sermon deliver against illhumour that may do very well for your town clergyman say he country people be never illhumoured though indeed it might be useful occasionally to my wife for instance and the judge we all laugh a do he likewise very cordially till he fell into a fit of cough which interrupt our conversation for a time herr schmidt resume the subject you call ill humour a crime he remark but i think you use too strong a term not at all i reply if that deserve the name which be so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbour be it not enough that we want the power to make one another happy must we deprive each other of the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves show me the man who have the courage to hide hi illhumour who bear the whole burden himself without disturb the peace of those around him no illhumour arise from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit from a discontent which ever accompany that envy which foolish vanity engenders we see people happy whom we have not make so and can not endure the sight charlotte look at me with a smile she observe the emotion with which i speak and a tear in the eye of frederica stimulate me to proceed woe unto those i say who use their power over a human heart to destroy the simple pleasure it would naturally enjoy all the favours all the attention in the world can not compensate for the loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny have destroy my heart be full a i speak a recollection of many thing which have happen press upon my mind and fill my eye with tear we should daily repeat to ourselves i exclaim that we should not interfere with our friend unless to leave them in possession of their own joy and increase their happiness by share it with them but when their soul be torment by a violent passion or their heart rent with grief be it in your power to afford them the slight consolation and when the last fatal malady seize the be whose untimely grave you have prepare when she lie languid and exhaust before you her dim eye raise to heaven and the damp of death upon her pallid brow there you stand at her bedside like a condemned criminal with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune could not save her and the agonise thought wring you that all your effort be powerless to impart even a moment strength to the depart soul or quicken her with a transitory consolation at these word the remembrance of a similar scene at which i have be once present fell with full force upon my heart i bury my face in my handkerchief and hasten from the room and be only recall to my recollection by charlotte voice who remind me that it be time to return home with what tenderness she chide me on the way for the too eager interest i take in everything she declare it would do me injury and that i ought to spare myself yes my angel i will do so for your sake she be still with her die friend and be still the same bright beautiful creature whose presence soften pain and shed happiness around whichever way she turn she go out yesterday with her little sister i know it and go to meet them and we walk together in about an hour and a half we return to the town we stop at the spring i be so fond of and which be now a thousand time dearer to me than ever charlotte seat herself upon the low wall and we gather about her i look around and recall the time when my heart be unoccupied and free dear fountain i say since that time i have no more come to enjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream i have pass thee with careless step and scarcely bestow a glance upon thee i look down and observed charlotte little sister jane come up the step with a glass of water i turn toward charlotte and i felt her influence over me jane at the moment approach with the glass her sister marianne wish to take it from her no cry the child with the sweet expression of face charlotte must drink first the affection and simplicity with which this be utter so charmed me that i seek to express my feeling by catch up the child and kiss her heartily she be frighten and begin to cry you should not do that say charlotte i felt perplexed come jane she continue take her hand and lead her down the step again it be no matter wash yourself quickly in the fresh water i stand and watch them and when i saw the little dear rub her cheek with her wet hand in full belief that all the impurity contract from my ugly beard would be wash off by the miraculous water and how though charlotte say it would do she continue still to wash with all her might a though she think too much be good than too little i assure you wilhelm i never attenda baptism with great reverence and when charlotte come up from the well i could have prostrate myself a before the prophet of an eastern nation in the evening i would not resist tell the story to a person who i think possess some natural feeling because he be a man of understand but what a mistake i make he maintain it be very wrong of charlotte that we should not deceive child that such thing occasion countless mistake and superstition from which we be bind to protect the young it occur to me then that this very man have be baptise only a week before so i say nothing far but maintain the justice of my own conviction we should deal with child a god deal with u we be happy under the influence of innocent delusion what a child be man that he should be so solicitous about a look what a child be man we have be to walheim the lady go in a carriage but during our walk i think i saw in charlotte dark eyesi be a foolbut forgive me you should see themthose eyeshowever to be brief for my own eye be weigh down with sleep you must know when the lady step into their carriage again young w seldstadt andran and i be stand about the door they be a merry set of fellow and they be all laughing and joke together i watch charlotte eye they wander from one to the other but they do not light on me on me who stand there motionless and who saw nothing but her my heart bid her a thousand time adieu but she notice me not the carriage drive off and my eye fill with tear i look after her suddenly i saw charlotte bonnet lean out of the window and she turn to look back be it at me my dear friend i know not and in this uncertainty i find consolation perhaps she turn to look at me perhaps goodnightwhat a child i be you should see how foolish i look in company when her name be mention particularly when i be ask plainly how i like her how i like her i detest the phrase what sort of creature must he be who merely like charlotte whose whole heart and sens be not entirely absorb by her like her some one ask me lately how i like ossian madame mi very ill i pray for her recovery because charlotte share my suffering i see her occasionally at my friend house and today she have tell me the strange circumstance old mi a covetous miserly fellow who have long worry and annoy the poor lady sadly but she have bear her affliction patiently a few day ago when the physician inform u that her recovery be hopeless she send for her husband charlotte be present and address him thus i have something to confess which after my decease may occasion trouble and confusion i have hitherto conduct your household a frugally and economically a possible but you must pardon me for have defraud you for thirty year at the commencement of our married life you allow a small sum for the want of the kitchen and the other household expense when our establishment increase and our property grow large i could not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance in proportion in short you know that when our want be great you require me to supply everything with seven florin a week i take the money from you without an observation but make up the weekly deficiency from the moneychest a nobody would suspect your wife of rob the household bank but i have waste nothing and should have be content to meet my eternal judge without this confession if she upon whom the management of your establishment will devolve after my decease would be free from embarrassment upon your insisting that the allowance make to me your former wife be sufficient i talk with charlotte of the inconceivable manner in which men allow themselves to be blind how any one could avoid suspect some deception when seven florin only be allow to defray expense twice a great but i have myself know people who believe without any visible astonishment that their house possess the prophet neverfailing cruse of oil no i be not deceive in her dark eye i read a genuine interest in me and in my fortune yes i feel it and i may believe my own heart which tell medare i say itdare i pronounce the divine wordsthat she love me that she love me how the idea exalts me in my own eye and a you can understand my feeling i may say to you how i honour myself since she love me be this presumption or be it a consciousness of the truth i do not know a man able to supplant me in the heart of charlotte and yet when she speak of her betroth with so much warmth and affection i feel like the soldier who have be strip of hi honour and title and deprive of hi sword how my heart beat when by accident i touch her finger or my foot meet hers under the table i draw back a if from a furnace but a secret force impels me forward again and my sens become disorder her innocent unconscious heart never know what agony these little familiarity inflict upon me sometimes when we be talk she lay her hand upon mine and in the eagerness of conversation come close to me and her balmy breath reach my lipswhen i feel a if lightning have strike me and that i could sink into the earth and yet wilhelm with all this heavenly confidenceif i know myself and should ever dareyou understand me no no my heart be not so corrupt it be weak weak enough but be not that a degree of corruption she be to me a sacred be all passion be still in her presence i can not express my sensation when i be near her i feel a if my soul beat in every nerve of my body there be a melody which she play on the piano with angelic skillso simple be it and yet so spiritual it be her favourite air and when she play the first note all pain care and sorrow disappear from me in a moment i believe every word that be say of the magic of ancient music how her simple song enchants me sometimes when i be ready to commit suicide she sing that air and instantly the gloom and madness which hung over me be dispersed and i breathe freely again wilhelm what be the world to our heart without love what be a magiclantern without light you have but to kindle the flame within and the bright figure shine on the white wall and if love only show u fleeting shadow we be yet happy when like mere child we behold them and be transport with the splendid phantom i have not be able to see charlotte today i be prevent by company from which i could not disengage myself what be to be do i send my servant to her house that i might at least see somebody today who have be near her oh the impatience with which i wait for hi return the joy with which i welcome him i should certainly have catch him in my arm and kiss him if i have not be ashamed it be say that the bonona stone when place in the sun attract the ray and for a time appear luminous in the dark so be it with me and this servant the idea that charlottes eye have dwell on hi countenance hi cheek hi very apparel endear them all inestimably to me so that at the moment i would not have part from him for a thousand crown hi presence make me so happy beware of laugh at me wilhelm can that be a delusion which make u happy i shall see her today i exclaim with delight when i rise in the morning and look out with gladness of heart at the bright beautiful sun i shall see her today and then i have no further wish to form all all be include in that one thought i can not assent to your proposal that i should accompany the ambassador to i do not love subordination and we all know that he be a rough disagreeable person to be connect with you say my mother wish me to be employ i could not help laugh at that be i not sufficiently employ and be it not in reality the same whether i shell pea or count lentils the world run on from one folly to another and the man who solely from regard to the opinion of other and without any wish or necessity of hi own toil after gold honour or any other phantom be no good than a fool you insist so much on my not neglect my drawing that it would be as well for me to say nothing a to confess how little i have lately do i never felt happier i never understand nature well even down to the veriest stem or small blade of grass and yet i be unable to express myself my power of execution be so weak everything seem to swim and float before me so that i can not make a clear bold outline but i fancy i should succeed good if i have some clay or wax to model i shall try if this state of mind continue much long and will take to model if i only knead dough i have commence charlotte portrait three time and have as often disgrace myself this be the more annoying a i be formerly very happy in take likeness i have since sketch her profile and must content myself with that yes dear charlotte i will order and arrange everything only give me more commission the more the good one thing however i must request use no more writingsand with the dear note you send me today i raise your letter hastily to my lip and it set my teeth on edge i have often determine not to see her so frequently but who could keep such a resolution every day i be expose to the temptation and promise faithfully that tomorrow i will really stay away but when tomorrow come i find some irresistible reason for see her and before i can account for it i be with her again either she have say on the previous evening you will be sure to call tomorrowand who could stay away thenor she give me some commission and i find it essential to take her the answer in person or the day be fine and i walk to walheim and when i be there it be only half a league farther to her i be within the charm atmosphere and soon find myself at her side my grandmother use to tell u a story of a mountain of loadstone when any vessel come near it they be instantly deprive of their ironwork the nail fly to the mountain and the unhappy crew perish amidst the disjointed plank albert be arrive and i must take my departure be he the best and noble of men and i in every respect hi inferior i could not endure to see him in possession of such a perfect be possessionenough wilhelm her betrothed be herea fine worthy fellow whom one can not help like fortunately i be not present at their meeting it would have break my heart and he be so considerate he have not give charlotte one kiss in my presence heaven reward him for it i must love him for the respect with which he treat her he show a regard for me but for this i suspect i be more indebted to charlotte than to hi own fancy for me woman have a delicate tact in such matter and it should be so they can not always succeed in keep two rival on term with each other but when they do they be the only gainer i can not help esteem albert the coolness of hi temper contrast strongly with the impetuosity of mine which i can not conceal he have a great deal of feeling and be fully sensible of the treasure he possess in charlotte he be free from illhumour which you know be the fault i detest most he regard me a a man of sense and my attachment to charlotte and the interest i take in all that concern her augment hi triumph and hi love i shall not inquire whether he may not at time tease her with some little jealousy a i know that be i in hi place i should not be entirely free from such sensation but be that a it may my pleasure with charlotte be over call it folly or infatuation what signify a name the thing speaks for itself before albert come i know all that i know now i know i could make no pretension to her nor do i offer any that be as far a it be possible in the presence of so much loveliness not to pant for it enjoyment and now behold me like a silly fellow star with astonishment when another come in and deprives me of my love i bite my lip and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to be resign because there be no help for it let me escape from the yoke of such silly subterfuge i ramble through the wood and when i return to charlotte and find albert sit by her side in the summerhouse in the garden i be unable to bear it behave like a fool and commit a thousand extravagance for heaven sake say charlotte today let u have no more scene like those of last night you terrify me when you be so violent between ourselves i be always away now when he visit her and i feel delighted when i find her alone believe me dear wilhelm i do not allude to you when i speak so severely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate i do not think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment but in fact you be right i only suggest one objection in this world one be seldom reduce to make a selection between two alternative there be a many variety of conduct and opinion a there be turn of feature between an aquiline nose and a flat one you will therefore permit me to concede your entire argument and yet contrive mean to escape your dilemma your position be this i hear you say either you have hope of obtain charlotte or you have none well in the first case pursue your course and press on to the fulfilment of your wish in the second be a man and shake off a miserable passion which will enervate and destroy you my dear friend this be well and easily say but would you require a wretched be whose life be slowly waste under a lingering disease to despatch himself at once by the stroke of a dagger do not the very disorder which consume hi strength deprive him of the courage to effect hi deliverance you may answer me if you please with a similar analogy who would not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of life by doubt and procrastination but i know not if i be right and let u leave these comparison enough there be moment wilhelm when i could rise up and shake it all off and when if i only know where to go i could fly from this place the same evening my diary which i have for some time neglect come before me today and i be amaze to see how deliberately i have entangle myself step by step to have see my position so clearly and yet to have act so like a child even still i behold the result plainly and yet have no thought of act with great prudence if i be not a fool i could spend the happiest and most delightful life here so many agreeable circumstance and of a kind to ensure a worthy man happiness be seldom united ala i feel it too sensiblythe heart alone make our happiness to be admit into this most charming family to be love by the father a a son by the child a a father and by charlotte then the noble albert who never disturb my happiness by any appearance of illhumour receive me with the hearty affection and love me next to charlotte good than all the world wilhelm you would be delight to hear u in our ramble and conversation about charlotte nothing in the world can be more absurd than our connection and yet the thought of it often move me to tear he tell me sometimes of her excellent mother how upon her deathbed she have commit her house and child to charlotte and have give charlotte herself in charge to him how since that time a new spirit have take possession of her how in care and anxiety for their welfare she become a real mother to them how every moment of her time be devote to some labour of love in their behalfand yet her mirth and cheerfulness have never forsake her i walk by hi side pluck flower by the way arrange them carefully into a nosegay then fling them into the first stream i pass and watch them a they float gently away i forget whether i tell you that albert be to remain here he have receive a government appointment with a very good salary and i understand he be in high favour at court i have meet few person so punctual and methodical in business certainly albert be the best fellow in the world i have a strange scene with him yesterday i go to take leave of him for i take it into my head to spend a few day in these mountain from where i now write to you a i be walk up and down hi room my eye fell upon hi pistol lend me those pistol say i for my journey by all mean he reply if you will take the trouble to load them for they only hang there for form i take down one of them and he continue ever since i be near suffer for my extreme caution i will have nothing to do with such thing i be curious to hear the story i be stay say he some three month ago at a friend house in the country i have a brace of pistol with me unloaded and i sleep without any anxiety one rainy afternoon i be sit by myself do nothing when it occur to me i do not know how that the house might be attack that we might require the pistol that we might in short you know how we go on fancy when we have nothing well to do i give the pistol to the servant to clean and load he be play with the maid and try to frighten her when the pistol go offgod know howthe ramrod be in the barrel and it go straight through her right hand and shatter the thumb i have to endure all the lamentation and to pay the surgeon bill so since that time i have keep all my weapon unload but my dear friend what be the use of prudence we can never be on our guard against all possible danger howevernow you must know i can tolerate all men till they come to howeverfor it be selfevident that every universal rule must have it exception but he be so exceedingly accurate that if he only fancy he have say a word too precipitate or too general or only half true he never cease to qualify to modify and extenuate till at last he appear to have say nothing at all upon this occasion albert be deeply immerse in hi subject i cease to listen to him and become lose in reverie with a sudden motion i point the mouth of the pistol to my forehead over the right eye what do you mean cry albert turn back the pistol it be not load say i and even if not he answer with impatience what can you mean i can not comprehend how a man can be so mad a to shoot himself and the bare idea of it shock me but why should any one say i in speaking of an action venture to pronounce it mad or wise or good or bad what be the meaning of all this have you carefully study the secret motif of our action do you understandcan you explain the cause which occasion them and make them inevitable if you can you will be less hasty with your decision but you will allow say albert that some action be criminal let them spring from whatever motif they may i grant it and shrug my shoulder but still my good friend i continue there be some exception here too theft be a crime but the man who commit it from extreme poverty with no design but to save hi family from perishing be he an object of pity or of punishment who shall throw the first stone at a husband who in the heat of just resentment sacrifice hi faithless wife and her perfidious seducer or at the young maiden who in her weak hour of rapture forgets herself in the impetuous joy of love even our law cold and cruel a they be relent in such case and withhold their punishment that be quite another thing say albert because a man under the influence of violent passion lose all power of reflection and be regard a intoxicated or insane oh you people of sound understanding i reply smile be ever ready to exclaim extravagance and madness and intoxication you moral men be so calm and so subdue you abhor the drunken man and detest the extravagant you pass by like the levite and thank god like the pharisee that you be not like one of them i have be more than once intoxicate my passion have always border on extravagance i be not ashamed to confess it for i have learn by my own experience that all extraordinary men who have accomplish great and astonishing action have ever be decry by the world a drunken or insane and in private life too be it not intolerable that no one can undertake the execution of a noble or generous deed without give rise to the exclamation that the doer be intoxicate or mad shame upon you ye sage this be another of your extravagant humour say albert you always exaggerate a case and in this matter you be undoubtedly wrong for we be speak of suicide which you compare with great action when it be impossible to regard it a anything but a weakness it be much easy to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude i be on the point of break off the conversation for nothing put me so completely out of patience a the utterance of a wretched commonplace when i be talk from my inmost heart however i compose myself for i have often hear the same observation with sufficient vexation and i answer him therefore with a little warmth you call this a weaknessbeware of be lead astray by appearance when a nation which have long groan under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant rise at last and throw off it chain do you call that weakness the man who to rescue hi house from the flame find hi physical strength redouble so that he lift burden with ease which in the absence of excitement he could scarcely move he who under the rage of an insult attack and put to flight half a score of hi enemy be such person to be call weak my good friend if resistance be strength how can the high degree of resistance be a weakness albert look steadfastly at me and say pray forgive me but i do not see that the example you have adduce bear any relation to the question very likely i answer for i have often be tell that my style of illustration border a little on the absurd but let u see if we can not place the matter in another point of view by inquire what can be a mans state of mind who resolve to free himself from the burden of lifea burden often so pleasant to bearfor we can not otherwise reason fairly upon the subject human nature i continue have it limit it be able to endure a certain degree of joy sorrow and pain but becomes annihilate as soon a this measure be exceed the question therefore be not whether a man be strong or weak but whether he be able to endure the measure of hi suffering the suffering may be moral or physical and in my opinion it be just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroy himself a to call a man a coward who die of a malignant fever paradox all paradox exclaim albert not so paradoxical a you imagine i reply you allow that we designate a disease a mortal when nature be so severely attacked and her strength so far exhaust that she can not possibly recover her former condition under any change that may take place now my good friend apply this to the mind observe a man in hi natural isolated condition consider how ideas work and how impression fasten on him till at length a violent passion seize him destroy all hi power of calm reflection and utterly ruin him it be in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understand the condition of such a wretched be in vain he counsel him he can no more communicate hi own wisdom to him than a healthy man can instil hi strength into the invalid by whose bedside he be seat albert think this too general i remind him of a girl who have drown herself a short time previously and i relate her history she be a good creature who have grow up in the narrow sphere of household industry and weekly appoint labour one who know no pleasure beyond indulge in a walk on sunday arrayed in her best attire accompany by her friend or perhaps join in the dance now and then at some festival and chat away her spare hour with a neighbour discuss the scandal or the quarrel of the village trifle sufficient to occupy her heart at length the warmth of her nature be influence by certain new and unknown wish inflame by the flattery of men her former pleasure become by degree insipid till at length she meet with a youth to whom she be attract by an indescribable feeling upon him she now rest all her hope she forget the world around her she see hears desire nothing but him and him only he alone occupy all her thought uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervate vanity her affection move steadily toward it object she hop to become hi and to realise in an everlasting union with him all that happiness which she seek all that bliss for which she long hi repeated promise confirm her hope embrace and endearment which increase the ardour of her desire overmaster her soul she float in a dim delusive anticipation of her happiness and her feeling become excite to their utmost tension she stretch out her arm finally to embrace the object of all her wish and her lover forsake her stunned and bewilder she stand upon a precipice all be darkness around her no prospect no hope no consolationforsaken by him in whom her existence be centre she see nothing of the wide world before her think nothing of the many individual who might supply the void in her heart she feel herself desert forsake by the world and blind and impel by the agony which wring her soul she plunge into the deep to end her suffering in the broad embrace of death see here albert the history of thousand and tell me be not this a case of physical infirmity nature have no way to escape from the labyrinth her power be exhaust she can contend no longer and the poor soul must die shame upon him who can look on calmly and exclaim the foolish girl she should have wait she should have allow time to wear off the impression her despair would have be soften and she would have find another lover to comfort her one might as well say the fool to die of a fever why do he not wait till hi strength be restore till hi blood become calm all would then have go well and he would have be alive now albert who could not see the justice of the comparison offer some further objection and amongst other urge that i have take the case of a mere ignorant girl but how any man of sense of more enlarged view and experience could be excuse he be unable to comprehend my friend i exclaim man be but man and whatever be the extent of hi reason power they be of little avail when passion rage within and he feel himself confine by the narrow limit of nature it be well thenbut we will talk of this some other time i say and catch up my hat ala my heart be full and we part without conviction on either side how rarely in this world do men understand each other there can be no doubt that in this world nothing be so indispensable a love i observe that charlotte could not lose me without a pang and the very child have but one wish that be that i should visit them again tomorrow i go this afternoon to tune charlotte piano but i could not do it for the little one insist on my tell them a story and charlotte herself urge me to satisfy them i wait upon them at tea and they be now a fully content with me a with charlotte and i tell them my very best tale of the princess who be wait upon by dwarf i improve myself by this exercise and be quite surprise at the impression my story create if i sometimes invent an incident which i forget upon the next narration they remind one directly that the story be different before so that i now endeavour to relate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone which never change i find by this how much an author injure hi work by alter them even though they be improve in a poetical point of view the first impression be readily receive we be so constituted that we believe the most incredible thing and once they be engrave upon the memory woe to him who would endeavour to efface them must it ever be thusthat the source of our happiness must also be the fountain of our misery the full and ardent sentiment which animate my heart with the love of nature overwhelm me with a torrent of delight and which bring all paradise before me have now become an insupportable torment a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me when in bygone day i gaze from these rock upon yonder mountain across the river and upon the green flowery valley before me and saw all nature budding and burst around the hill clothe from foot to peak with tall thick forest tree the valley in all their varied winding shade with the lovely wood and the soft river glide along amongst the lisping reeds mirror the beautiful cloud which the soft evening breeze waft across the skywhen i hear the grove about me melodious with the music of bird and saw the million swarm of insect dance in the last golden beam of the sun whose setting ray awake the humming beetle from their grassy bed whilst the subdued tumult around direct my attention to the ground and i there observe the arid rock compel to yield nutriment to the dry moss whilst the heath flourish upon the barren sand below me all this display to me the inner warmth which animate all nature and fill and glow within my heart i felt myself exalt by this overflow ful to the perception of the godhead and the glorious form of an infinite universe become visible to my soul stupendous mountain encompass me aby yawn at my foot and cataract fell headlong down before me impetuous river roll through the plain and rock and mountain resound from afar in the depth of the earth i saw innumerable power in motion and multiplying to infinity whilst upon it surface and beneath the heaven there teem ten thousand variety of living creature everything around be alive with an infinite number of form while mankind fly for security to their petty house from the shelter of which they rule in their imagination over the wideextended universe poor fool in whose petty estimation all thing be little from the inaccessible mountain across the desert which no mortal foot have trod far a the confines of the unknown ocean breathe the spirit of the eternal creator and every atom to which he have give existence find favour in hi sight ah how often at that time have the flight of a bird soar above my head inspire me with the desire of be transport to the shore of the immeasurable water there to quaff the pleasure of life from the foam goblet of the infinite and to partake if but for a moment even with the confined power of my soul the beatitude of that creator who accomplish all thing in himself and through himself my dear friend the bare recollection of those hour still console me even this effort to recall those ineffable sensation and give them utterance exalts my soul above itself and make me doubly feel the intensity of my present anguish it be a if a curtain have be draw from before my eye and instead of prospect of eternal life the abyss of an ever open grave yawn before me can we say of anything that it exist when all pass away when time with the speed of a storm carry all thing onwardand our transitory existence hurry along by the torrent be either swallow up by the wave or dash against the rock there be not a moment but prey upon youand upon all around you not a moment in which you do not yourself become a destroyer the most innocent walk deprives of life thousand of poor insect one step destroy the fabric of the industrious ant and convert a little world into chaos no it be not the great and rare calamity of the world the flood which sweep away whole village the earthquake which swallow up our town that affect me my heart be waste by the thought of that destructive power which lie conceal in every part of universal nature nature have form nothing that do not consume itself and every object near it so that surround by earth and air and all the active power i wander on my way with ache heart and the universe be to me a fearful monster for ever devour it own offspring in vain do i stretch out my arm toward her when i awaken in the morning from my weary slumber in vain do i seek for her at night in my bed when some innocent dream have happily deceive me and place her near me in the field when i have seize her hand and cover it with countless kiss and when i feel for her in the half confusion of sleep with the happy sense that she be near tear flow from my oppressed heart and bereft of all comfort i weep over my future woes what a misfortune wilhelm my active spirit have degenerate into contented indolence i can not be idle and yet i be unable to set to work i can not think i have no long any feeling for the beauty of nature and book be distasteful to me once we give ourselves up we be totally lose many a time and oft i wish i be a common labourer that awaken in the morning i might have but one prospect one pursuit one hope for the day which have dawn i often envy albert when i see him bury in a heap of paper and parchment and i fancy i should be happy be i in hi place often impress with this feeling i have be on the point of write to you and to the minister for the appointment at the embassy which you think i might obtain i believe i might procure it the minister have long show a regard for me and have frequently urge me to seek employment it be the business of an hour only now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me weary of liberty he suffer himself to be saddle and bridle and be ride to death for hi pain i know not what to determine upon for be not this anxiety for change the consequence of that restless spirit which would pursue me equally in every situation of life if my ill would admit of any cure they would certainly be cure here this be my birthday and early in the morning i receive a packet from albert upon open it i find one of the pink ribbon which charlotte wore in her dress the first time i saw her and which i have several time ask her to give me with it be two volume in duodecimo of wetsteins homer a book i have often wish for to save me the inconvenience of carry the large ernestine edition with me upon my walk you see how they anticipate my wish how well they understand all those little attention of friendship so superior to the costly present of the great which be humiliate i kiss the ribbon a thousand time and in every breath inhale the remembrance of those happy and irrevocable day which fill me with the keen joy such wilhelm be our fate i do not murmur at it the flower of life be but visionary how many pass away and leave no trace behindhow few yield any fruitand the fruit itself how rarely do it ripen and yet there be flower enough and be it not strange my friend that we should suffer the little that do really ripen to rot decay and perish unenjoyed farewell this be a glorious summer i often climb into the tree in charlotte orchard and shake down the pear that hang on the high branch she stand below and catch them a they fall unhappy be that i be why do i thus deceive myself what be to come of all this wild aimless endless passion i can not pray except to her my imagination see nothing but her all surrounding object be of no account except a they relate to her in this dreamy state i enjoy many happy hour till at length i feel compel to tear myself away from her ah wilhelm to what do not my heart often compel me when i have spend several hour in her company till i feel completely absorb by her figure her grace the divine expression of her thought my mind become gradually excite to the high excess my sight grow dim my hearing confuse my breathing oppress a if by the hand of a murderer and my beating heart seek to obtain relief for my aching sens i be sometimes unconscious whether i really exist if in such moment i find no sympathy and charlotte do not allow me to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bath her hand with my tear i feel compel to tear myself from her when i either wander through the country climb some precipitous cliff or force a path through the trackless thicket where i be lacerate and tear by thorn and brier and thence i find relief sometimes i lie stretch on the ground overcome with fatigue and die with thirst sometimes late in the night when the moon shine above me i recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest to rest my weary limb when exhaust and wear i sleep till break of day o wilhelm the hermit cell hi sackcloth and girdle of thorn would be luxury and indulgence compare with what i suffer adieu i see no end to this wretchedness except the grave i must away thank you wilhelm for determine my waver purpose for a whole fortnight i have think of leave her i must away she have return to town and be at the house of a friend and then albertyes i must go oh what a night wilhelm i can henceforth bear anything i shall never see her again oh why can not i fall on your neck and with flood of tear and rapture give utterance to all the passion which distract my heart here i sit gasp for breath and struggle to compose myself i wait for day and at sunrise the horse be to be at the door and she be sleep calmly little suspect that she have see me for the last time i be free i have have the courage in an interview of two hour duration not to betray my intention and o wilhelm what a conversation it be albert have promise to come to charlotte in the garden immediately after supper i be upon the terrace under the tall chestnut tree and watch the setting sun i saw him sink for the last time beneath this delightful valley and silent stream i have often visit the same spot with charlotte and witness that glorious sight and nowi be walk up and down the very avenue which be so dear to me a secret sympathy have frequently draw me thither before i know charlotte and we be delight when in our early acquaintance we discover that we each love the same spot which be indeed as romantic a any that ever captivate the fancy of an artist from beneath the chestnut tree there be an extensive view but i remember that i have mention all this in a former letter and have describe the tall mass of beech tree at the end and how the avenue grow darker and darker a it wind it way among them till it end in a gloomy recess which have all the charm of a mysterious solitude i still remember the strange feeling of melancholy which come over me the first time i enter that dark retreat at bright midday i felt some secret foreboding that it would one day be to me the scene of some happiness or misery i have spend half an hour struggle between the contend thought of go and return when i hear them come up the terrace i run to meet them i tremble a i take her hand and kiss it a we reach the top of the terrace the moon rise from behind the wooded hill we converse on many subject and without perceive it approach the gloomy recess charlotte enter and sit down albert seat himself beside her i do the same but my agitation do not suffer me to remain long seat i get up and stand before her then walk backward and forward and sit down again i be restless and miserable charlotte draw our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight which throw a silver hue over the terrace in front of u beyond the beech tree it be a glorious sight and be render more striking by the darkness which surround the spot where we be we remain for some time silent when charlotte observe whenever i walk by moonlight it bring to my remembrance all my beloved and depart friend and i be fill with thought of death and futurity we shall live again werther she continue with a firm but feeling voice but shall we know one another again what do you think what do you say charlotte i say a i take her hand in mine and my eye fill with tear we shall see each other againhere and hereafter we shall meet again i could say no more why wilhelm should she put this question to me just at the moment when the fear of our cruel separation fill my heart and oh do those departed one know how we be employ here do they know when we be well and happy do they know when we recall their memory with the fond love in the silent hour of even the shade of my mother hovers around me when seat in the midst of my child i see them assemble near me a they use to assemble near her and then i raise my anxious eye to heaven and wish she could look down upon u and witness how i fulfil the promise i make to her in her last moment to be a mother to her child with what emotion do i then exclaim pardon dearest of mother pardon me if i do not adequately supply your place ala i do my utmost they be clothe and feed and still well they be love and educate could you but see sweet saint the peace and harmony that dwell amongst u you would glorify god with the warm feeling of gratitude to whom in your last hour you address such fervent prayer for our happiness thus do she express herself but o wilhelm who can do justice to her language how can cold and passionless word convey the heavenly expression of the spirit albert interrupt her gently this affect you too deeply my dear charlotte i know your soul dwells on such recollection with intense delight but i implore o albert she continue i be sure you do not forget the evening when we three use to sit at the little round table when papa be absent and the little one have retire you often have a good book with you but seldom read it the conversation of that noble be be preferable to everythingthat beautiful bright gentle and yet evertoiling woman god alone know how i have supplicate with tear on my nightly couch that i might be like her i throw myself at her foot and seize her hand bedew it with a thousand tear charlotte i exclaim god blessing and your mother spirit be upon you oh that you have know her she say with a warm pressure of the hand she be worthy of be know to you i think i should have faint never have i receive praise so flattering she continue and yet she be doom to die in the flower of her youth when her young child be scarcely six month old her illness be but short but she be calm and resign and it be only for her child especially the young that she felt unhappy when her end drew nigh she bid me bring them to her i obey the young one know nothing of their approaching loss while the elder one be quite overcome with grief they stand around the bed and she raise her feeble hand to heaven and pray over them then kiss them in turn she dismiss them and say to me be you a mother to them i give her my hand you be promise much my child she say a mother fondness and a mother care i have often witness by your tear of gratitude that you know what be a mother tenderness show it to your brother and sister and be dutiful and faithful to your father a a wife you will be hi comfort she inquire for him he have retire to conceal hi intolerable anguishhe be heartbroken albert you be in the room she hear some one move she inquire who it be and desire you to approach she survey u both with a look of composure and satisfaction expressive of her conviction that we should be happyhappy with one another albert fell upon her neck and kiss her and exclaim we be so and we shall be so even albert generally so tranquil have quite lose hi composure and i be excite beyond expression and such a be she continue be to leave u werther great god must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this world nobody felt this more acutely than the child they cry and lament for a long time afterward complain that men have carry away their dear mamma charlotte rise it arouse me but i continue sit and hold her hand let u go she say it grow late she attempt to withdraw her hand i hold it still we shall see each other

meet again yes tomorrow i think she answer with a smile tomorrow how i felt the word ah she little think when she draw her hand away from mine they walk down the avenue i stand gaze after them in the moonlight i throw myself upon the ground and wept i then spring up and run out upon the terrace and saw under the shade of the lindentrees her white dress disappearing near the gardengate i stretch out my arm and she vanish we arrive here yesterday the ambassador be indispose and will not go out for some day if he be less peevish and morose all would be well i see but too plainly that heaven have destine me to severe trial but courage a light heart may bear anything a light heart i smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen a little more lightheartedness would render me the happy be under the sun but must i despair of my talent and faculty whilst other of far inferior ability parade before me with the utmost selfsatisfaction gracious providence to whom i owe all my power why didst thou not withhold some of those blessing i possess and substitute in their place a feeling of selfconfidence and contentment but patience all will yet be well for i assure you my dear friend you be right since i have be oblige to associate continually with other people and observe what they do and how they employ themselves i have become far well satisfied with myself for we be so constitute by nature that we be ever prone to compare ourselves with other and our happiness or misery depend very much on the object and person around u on this account nothing be more dangerous than solitude there our imagination always dispose to rise take a new flight on the wing of fancy picture to u a chain of being of whom we seem the most inferior all thing appear great than they really be and all seem superior to u this operation of the mind be quite natural we so continually feel our own imperfection and fancy we perceive in other the quality we do not possess attribute to them also all that we enjoy ourselves that by this process we form the idea of a perfect happy mana man however who only exist in our own imagination but when in spite of weakness and disappointment we set to work in earnest and persevere steadily we often find that though oblige continually to tack we make more way than other who have the assistance of wind and tide and in truth there can be no great satisfaction than to keep pace with other or outstrip them in the race november i begin to find my situation here more tolerable consider all circumstance i find a great advantage in be much occupy and the number of person i meet and their different pursuit create a varied entertainment for me i have form the acquaintance of the count cand i esteem him more and more every day he be a man of strong understanding and great discernment but though he see farther than other people he be not on that account cold in hi manner but capable of inspire and return the warm affection he appear interested in me on one occasion when i have to transact some business with him he perceive at the first word that we understand each other and that he could converse with me in a different tone from what he use with other i can not sufficiently esteem hi frank and open kindness to me it be the great and most genuine of pleasure to observe a great mind in sympathy with our own a i anticipate the ambassador occasion me infinite annoyance he be the most punctilious blockhead under heaven he do everything step by step with the trifle minuteness of an old woman and he be a man whom it be impossible to please because he be never please with himself i like to do business regularly and cheerfully and when it be finish to leave it but he constantly return my paper to me say they will do but recommend me to look over them again a one may always improve by use a good word or a more appropriate particle i then lose all patience and wish myself at the devil not a conjunction not an adverb must be omit he have a deadly antipathy to all those transposition of which i be so fond and if the music of our period be not tune to the establish official key he can not comprehend our mean it be deplorable to be connect with such a fellow my acquaintance with the count ci the only compensation for such an evil he tell me frankly the other day that he be much displease with the difficulty and delay of the ambassador that people like him be obstacle both to themselves and to other but add he one must submit like a traveller who have to ascend a mountain if the mountain be not there the road would be both short and pleasanter but there it be and he must get over it the old man perceive the count partiality for me this annoy him and he seize every opportunity to depreciate the count in my hearing i naturally defend him and that only make matter bad yesterday he make me indignant for he also allude to me the count he say be a man of the world and a good man of business hi style be good and he write with facility but like other genius he have no solid learning he look at me with an expression that seem to ask if i felt the blow but it do not produce the desired effect i despise a man who can think and act in such a manner however i make a stand and answer with not a little warmth the count i say be a man entitle to respect alike for hi character and hi acquirement i have never meet a person whose mind be store with more useful and extensive knowledgewho have in fact master such an infinite variety of subject and who yet retain all hi activity for the detail of ordinary business this be altogether beyond hi comprehension and i take my leave l my anger should be too highly excite by some new absurdity of hi and you be to blame for all this you who persuade me to bend my neck to this yoke by preach a life of activity to me if the man who plant vegetable and carry hi corn to town on marketdays be not more usefully employ than i be then let me work ten year longer at the galley to which i be now chain oh the brilliant wretchedness the weariness that one be doom to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here the ambition of rank how they watch how they toil to gain precedence what poor and contemptible passion be display in their utter nakedness we have a woman here for example who never cease to entertain the company with account of her family and her estate any stranger would consider her a silly be whose head be turn by her pretension to rank and property but she be in reality even more ridiculous the daughter of a mere magistrate clerk from this neighbourhood i can not understand how human being can so debase themselves every day i observe more and more the folly of judging of other by ourselves and i have so much trouble with myself and my own heart be in such constant agitation that i be well content to let other pursue their own course if they only allow me the same privilege what provoke me most be the unhappy extent to which distinction of rank be carry i know perfectly well how necessary be inequality of condition and i be sensible of the advantage i myself derive therefrom but i would not have these institution prove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which i may enjoy on this earth i have lately become acquaint with a miss b a very agreeable girl who have retain her natural manner in the midst of artificial life our first conversation please u both equally and at take leave i request permission to visit her she consent in so oblige a manner that i wait with impatience for the arrival of the happy moment she be not a native of this place but resides here with her aunt the countenance of the old lady be not prepossess i pay her much attention address the great part of my conversation to her and in less than half an hour i discover what her niece subsequently acknowledge to me that her aged aunt have but a small fortune and a still small share of understand enjoy no satisfaction except in the pedigree of her ancestor no protection save in her noble birth and no enjoyment but in look from her castle over the head of the humble citizen she be no doubt handsome in her youth and in her early year probably trifle away her time in render many a poor youth the sport of her caprice in her riper year she have submit to the yoke of a veteran officer who in return for her person and her small independence have spend with her what we may designate her age of brass he be dead and she be now a widow and desert she spend her iron age alone and would not be approach except for the loveliness of her niece what being be men whose whole thought be occupy with form and ceremony who for year together devote their mental and physical exertion to the task of advance themselves but one step and endeavour to occupy a high place at the table not that such person would otherwise want employment on the contrary they give themselves much trouble by neglect important business for such petty trifle last week a question of precedence arose at a sledgingparty and all our amusement be spoil the silly creature can not see that it be not place which constitute real greatness since the man who occupy the first place but seldom play the principal part how many king be govern by their ministershow many minister by their secretary who in such case be really the chief he a it seem to me who can see through the other and possess strength or skill enough to make their power or passion subservient to the execution of hi own design i must write to you from this place my dear charlotte from a small room in a country inn where i have take shelter from a severe storm during my whole residence in that wretched place d where i live amongst strangersstrangers indeed to this hearti never at any time felt the small inclination to correspond with you but in this cottage in this retirement in this solitude with the snow and hail beating against my latticepane you be my first think the instant i enter your figure rise up before me and the remembrance o my charlotte the sacred tender remembrance gracious heaven restore to me the happy moment of our first acquaintance could you but see me my dear charlotte in the whirl of dissipationhow my sens be dry up but my heart be at no time full i enjoy no single moment of happiness all be vainnothing touch me i stand a it be before the rareeshow i see the little puppet move and i ask whether it be not an optical illusion i be amuse with these puppet or rather i be myself one of them but when i sometimes grasp my neighbour hand i feel that it be not natural and i withdraw mine with a shudder in the evening i say i will enjoy the next morning sunrise and yet i remain in bed in the day i promise to ramble by moonlight and i nevertheless remain at home i know not why i rise nor why i go to sleep the leaven which animate my existence be go the charm which cheer me in the gloom of night and arouse me from my morning slumber be for ever flee i have find but one be here to interest me a miss b she resemble you my dear charlotte if any one can possibly resemble you ah you will say he have learn how to pay fine compliment and this be partly true i have be very agreeable lately a it be not in my power to be otherwise i have moreover a deal of wit and the lady say that no one understand flattery well or falsehood you will add since the one accomplishment invariably accompany the other but i must tell you of miss b she have abundance of soul which flash from her deep blue eye her rank be a torment to her and satisfy no one desire of her heart she would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion and we often picture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant scene of rural retirement and then we speak of you my dear charlotte for she know you and render homage to your merit but her homage be not exact but voluntary she love you and delight to hear you make the subject of conversation oh that i be sit at your foot in your favourite little room with the dear child play around u if they become troublesome to you i would tell them some appal goblin story and they would crowd round me with silent attention the sun be set in glory hi last ray be shin on the snow which cover the face of the country the storm be over and i must return to my dungeon adieuis albert with you and what be he to you god forgive the question for a week past we have have the most wretched weather but this to me be a blessing for during my residence here not a single fine day have beam from the heaven but have be lose to me by the intrusion of somebody during the severity of rain sleet frost and storm i congratulate myself that it can not be bad indoors than abroad nor bad abroad than it be within door and so i become reconciled when the sun rise bright in the morning and promise a glorious day i never omit to exclaim there now they have another blessing from heaven which they will be sure to destroy they spoil everythinghealth fame happiness amusement and they do this generally through folly ignorance or imbecility and always accord to their own account with the best intention i could often beseech them on my bended knee to be less resolve upon their own destruction i fear that my ambassador and i shall not continue much longer together he be really grow past endurance he transact hi business in so ridiculous a manner that i be often compel to contradict him and do thing my own way and then of course he think them very ill do he complain of me lately on this account at court and the minister give me a reprimanda gentle one it be true but still a reprimand in consequence of this i be about to tender my resignation when i receive a letter to which i submit with great respect on account of the high noble and generous spirit which dictate it he endeavour to soothe my excessive sensibility pay a tribute to my extreme idea of duty of good example and of perseverance in business a the fruit of my youthful ardour an impulse which he do not seek to destroy but only to moderate that it might have proper play and be productive of good so now i be at rest for another week and no long at variance with myself content and peace of mind be valuable thing i could wish my dear friend that these precious jewel be less transitory god bless you my dear friend and may he grant you that happiness which he deny to me i thank you albert for have deceive me i wait for the news that your weddingday be fix and i intend on that day with solemnity to take down charlotte profile from the wall and to bury it with some other paper i possess you be now united and her picture still remain here well let it remain why should it not i know that i be still one of your society that i still occupy a place uninjured in charlotte heart that i hold the second place therein and i intend to keep it oh i should become mad if she could forget albert that thought be hell farewell albert farewell angel of heaven farewell charlotte i have just have a sad adventure which will drive me away from here i lose all patiencedeathit be not to be remedied and you alone be to blame for you urge and impel me to fill a post for which i be by no mean suit i have now reason to be satisfied and so have you but that you may not again attribute this fatality to my impetuous temper i send you my dear sir a plain and simple narration of the affair a a mere chronicler of fact would describe it the count of olikes and distinguishes me it be well know and i have mention this to you a hundred time yesterday i din with him it be the day on which the nobility be accustom to assemble at hi house in the evening i never once think of the assembly nor that we subalterns do not belong to such society well i din with the count and after dinner we adjourn to the large hall we walk up and down together and i converse with him and with colonel b who join u and in this manner the hour for the assembly approach god know i be think of nothing when who should enter but the honourable lady accompany by her noble husband and their silly scheme daughter with her small waist and flat neck and with disdainful look and a haughty air they pass me by a i heartily detest the whole race i determine upon go away and only wait till the count have disengage himself from their impertinent prattle to take leave when the agreeable miss bcame in a i never meet her without experience a heartfelt pleasure i stay and talk to her leaning over the back of her chair and do not perceive till after some time that she seem a little confused and cease to answer me with her usual ease of manner i be strike with it heavens i say to myself can she too be like the rest i felt annoyed and be about to withdraw but i remain

your melancholy town adieu my dear friend you shall hear of my future career i have pay my visit to my native place with all the devotion of a pilgrim and have experience many unexpected emotion near the great elm tree which be a quarter of a league from the village i get out of the carriage and send it on before that alone and on foot i might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of my recollection i stand there under that same elm which be formerly the term and object of my walk how thing have since change then in happy ignorance i sigh for a world i do not know where i hop to find every pleasure and enjoyment which my heart could desire and now on my return from that wide world o my friend how many disappointed hope and unsuccessful plan have i bring back a i contemplate the mountain which lay stretch out before me i think how often they have be the object of my dear desire here use i to sit for hour together with my eye bend upon them ardently long to wander in the shade of those wood to lose myself in those valley which form so delightful an object in the distance with what reluctance do i leave this charming spot when my hour of recreation be over and my leave of absence expire i draw near to the village all the wellknown old summerhouse and garden be recognise again i dislike the new one and all other alteration which have take place i enter the village and all my former feeling return i can not my dear friend enter into detail charm a be my sensation they would be dull in the narration i have intend to lodge in the marketplace near our old house as soon a i enter i perceive that the schoolroom where our childhood have be teach by that good old woman be convert into a shop i call to mind the sorrow the heaviness the tear and oppression of heart which i experience in that confinement every step produce some particular impression a pilgrim in the holy land do not meet so many spot pregnant with tender recollection and hi soul be hardly move with great devotion one incident will serve for illustration i follow the course of a stream to a farm formerly a delightful walk of mine and pause at the spot where when boys we use to amuse ourselves make duck and drake upon the water i recollect so well how i use formerly to watch the course of that same stream follow it with inquire eagerness form romantic idea of the country it be to pass through but my imagination be soon exhaust while the water continue flow far and far on till my fancy become bewilder by the contemplation of an invisible distance exactly such my dear friend so happy and so confine be the thought of our good ancestor their feeling and their poetry be fresh a childhood and when ulysses talk of the immeasurable sea and boundless earth hi epithet be true natural deeply felt and mysterious of what importance be it that i have learn with every schoolboy that the world be round man need but little earth for enjoyment and still less for hi final repose i be at present with the prince at hi hunt lodge he be a man with whom one can live happily he be honest and unaffected there be however some strange character about him whom i can not at all understand they do not seem vicious and yet they do not carry the appearance of thoroughly honest men sometimes i be dispose to believe them honest and yet i can not persuade myself to confide in them it grieve me to hear the prince occasionally talk of thing which he have only read or hear of and always with the same view in which they have be represent by other he value my understanding and talent more highly than my heart but i be proud of the latter only it be the sole source of everything of our strength happiness and misery all the knowledge i possess every one els can acquire but my heart be exclusively my own i have have a plan in my head of which i do not intend to speak to you until it be accomplish now that it have fail i may as well mention it i wish to enter the army and have long be desirous of take the step this indeed be the chief reason for my come here with the prince a he be a general in the service i communicate my design to him during one of our walk together he disapprove of it and it would have be actual madness not to have listen to hi reason say what you will i can remain here no longer why should i remain time hang heavy upon my hand the prince be as gracious to me a any one could be and yet i be not at my ease there be indeed nothing in common between u he be a man of understand but quite of the ordinary kind hi conversation affords me no more amusement than i should derive from the perusal of a wellwritten book i shall remain here a week longer and then start again on my travel my drawing be the best thing i have do since i come here the prince have a taste for the art and would improve if hi mind be not fetter by cold rule and mere technical idea i often lose patience when with a glow imagination i be give expression to art and nature he interfere with learned suggestion and us at random the technical phraseology of artist once more i be a wanderer a pilgrim through the world but what els be you whither be i go i will tell you in confidence i be oblige to continue a fortnight longer here and then i think it would be good for me to visit the mine in but i be only delude myself thus the fact be i wish to be near charlotte again that be all i smile at the suggestion of my heart and obey it dictate no no it be yet well all be well i her husband o god who give me be if thou hadst destine this happiness for me my whole life would have be one continual thanksgiving but i will not murmurforgive these tear forgive these fruitless wish shemy wife oh the very thought of fold that dear of heaven creature in my arm dear wilhelm my whole frame feel convulse when i see albert put hi arm around her slender waist and shall i avow it why should i not wilhelm she would have be happy with me than with him albert be not the man to satisfy the wish of such a heart he want a certain sensibility he wantsin short their heart do not beat in unison how often my dear friend im read a passage from some interesting book when my heart and charlotte seem to meet and in a hundred other instance when our sentiment be unfold by the story of some fictitious character have i felt that we be make for each other but dear wilhelm he love her with hi whole soul and what do not such a love deserve i have be interrupt by an insufferable visit i have dry my tear and compose my thought adieu my best friend i be not alone unfortunate all men be disappoint in their hope and deceive in their expectation i have pay a visit to my good old woman under the limetrees the eldest boy run out to meet me hi exclamation of joy bring out hi mother but she have a very melancholy look her first word be ala dear sir my little john be dead he be the young of her child i be silent and my husband have return from switzerland without any money and if some kind people have not assist him he must have beg hi way home he be take ill with fever on hi journey i could answer nothing but make the little one a present she invite me to take some fruit i comply and leave the place with a sorrowful heart my sensation be constantly change sometimes a happy prospect open before me but alas it be only for a moment and then when i be lose in reverie i can not help say to myself if albert be to dieyes she would becomeand i should beand so i pursue a chimera till it lead me to the edge of a precipice at which i shudder when i pass through the same gate and walk along the same road which first conduct me to charlotte my heart sink within me at the change that have since take place all all be alter no sentiment no pulsation of my heart be the same my sensation be such a would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should return to visit the superb palace which he have build in happy time adorn with costly magnificence and leave to a beloved son but whose glory he should find departed and it hall desert and in ruin i sometimes can not understand how she can love another how she dare love another when i love nothing in this world so completely so devotedly a i love her when i know only her and have no other possession it be even so a nature put on her autumn tint it become autumn with me and around me my leaf be sere and yellow and the neighbouring tree be divest of their foliage do you remember my write to you about a peasant boy shortly after my arrival here i have just make inquiry about him in walheim they say he have be dismiss from hi service and be now avoid by every one i meet him yesterday on the road go to a neighbouring village i speak to him and he tell me hi story it interest me exceedingly a you will easily understand when i repeat it to you but why should i trouble you why should i not reserve all my sorrow for myself why should i continue to give you occasion to pity and blame me but no matter this also be part of my destiny at first the peasant lad answer my inquiry with a sort of subdue melancholy which seem to me the mark of a timid disposition but a we grow to understand each other he speak with less reserve and openly confess hi fault and lament hi misfortune i wish my dear friend i could give proper expression to hi language he tell me with a sort of pleasurable recollection that after my departure hi passion for hi mistress increase daily until at last he neither know what he do nor what he say nor what be to become of him he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep he felt a sense of suffocation he disobey all order and forget all command involuntarily he seem a if pursue by an evil spirit till one day know that hi mistress have go to an upper chamber he have follow or rather be draw after her a she prove deaf to hi entreaty he have recourse to violence he know not what happen but he call god to witness that hi intention to her be honourable and that he desire nothing more sincerely than that they should marry and pass their life together when he have come to this point he begin to hesitate a if there be something which he have not courage to utter till at length he acknowledge with some confusion certain little confidence she have encourage and liberties she have allow he break off two or three time in hi narration and assure me most earnestly that he have no wish to make her bad a he term it for he love her still as sincerely a ever that the tale have never before escape hi lip and be only now tell to convince me that he be not utterly lose and abandon and here my dear friend i must commence the old song which you know i utter eternally if i could only represent the man a he stand and stand now before me could i only give hi true expression you would feel compel to sympathise in hi fate but enough you who know my misfortune and my disposition can easily comprehend the attraction which draw me toward every unfortunate be but particularly toward him whose story i have recount on peruse this letter a second time i find i have omit the conclusion of my tale but it be easily supply she become reserved toward him at the instigation of her brother who have long hat him and desire hi expulsion from the house fear that hi sister second marriage might deprive hi child of the handsome fortune they expect from her a she be childless he be dismiss at length and the whole affair occasion so much scandal that the mistress dare not take him back even if she have wish it she have since hire another servant with whom they say her brother be equally displeased and whom she be likely to marry but my informant assures me that he himself be determine not to survive such a catastrophe this story be neither exaggerated nor embellished indeed i have weaken and impair it in the narration by the necessity of use the more refined expression of society this love then this constancy this passion be no poetical fiction it be actual and dwell in it great purity amongst that class of mankind whom we term rude uneducated we be the educate not the pervert but read this story with attention i implore you i be tranquil today for i have be employ upon this narration you see by my writing that i be not so agitated a usual i read and reread this tale wilhelm it be the history of your friend my fortune have be and will be similar and i be neither half so brave nor half so determine a the poor wretch with whom i hesitate to compare myself charlotte have write a letter to her husband in the country where he be detain by business it commence my dear love return as soon a possible i await you with a thousand raptures a friend who arrive brought word that for certain reason he could not return immediately charlotte letter be not forward and the same evening it fell into my hand i read it and smile she ask the reason what a heavenly treasure be imagination i exclaim i fancy for a moment that this be write to me she pause and seem displeased i be silent it cost me much to part with the blue coat which i wear the first time i dance with charlotte but i could not possibly wear it any longer but i have order a new one precisely similar even to the collar and sleeve as well a a new waistcoat and pantaloon but it do not produce the same effect upon me i know not how it be but i hope in time i shall like it well she have be absent for some day she go to meet albert today i visit her she rise to receive me and i kiss her hand most tenderly a canary at the moment fly from a mirror and settle upon her shoulder here be a new friend she observe while she make him perch upon her hand he be a present for the child what a dear he be look at him when i fee him he flutter with hi wing and peck so nicely he kiss me too only look she hold the bird to her mouth and he press her sweet lip with so much fervour that he seem to feel the excess of bliss which he enjoy he shall kiss you too she add and then she hold the bird toward me hi little beak move from her mouth to mine and the delightful sensation seem like the forerunner of the sweet bliss a kiss i observe do not seem to satisfy him he wish for food and seem disappoint by these unsatisfactory endearment but he eat out of my mouth she continue and extend her lip to him contain seed and she smile with all the charm of a be who have allow an innocent participation of her love i turn my face away she should not act thus she ought not to excite my imagination with such display of heavenly innocence and happiness nor awaken my heart from it slumber in which it dream of the worthlessness of life and why not because she know how much i love her it make me wretched wilhelm to think that there should be men incapable of appreciate the few thing which possess a real value in life you remember the walnut tree at s under which i use to sit with charlotte during my visit to the worthy old vicar those glorious tree the very sight of which have so often fill my heart with joy how they adorn and refresh the parsonage yard with their wideextended branch and how pleasing be our remembrance of the good old pastor by whose hand they be plant so many year ago the schoolmaster have frequently mention hi name he have it from hi grandfather he must have be a most excellent man and under the shade of those old tree hi memory be ever venerate by me the schoolmaster inform u yesterday with tear in hi eye that those tree have be fell yes cut to the ground i could in my wrath have slay the monster who strike the first stroke and i must endure thisi who if i have have two such tree in my own court and one have die from old age should have weep with real affliction but there be some comfort leave such a thing be sentiment the whole village murmur at the misfortune and i hope the vicar wife will soon find by the cessation of the villager present how much she have wound the feeling of the neighborhhood it be she who do it the wife of the present incumbent our good old man be dead a tall sickly creature who be so far right to disregard the world a the world totally disregard her the silly be affect to be learn pretend to examine the canonical book lend her aid toward the newfashioned reformation of christendom moral and critical and shrug up her shoulder at the mention of lavaters enthusiasm her health be destroy on account of which she be prevent from have any enjoyment here below only such a creature could have cut down my walnut tree i can never pardon it hear her reason the fall leaf make the court wet and dirty the branch obstruct the light boy throw stone at the nut when they be ripe and the noise affect her nerve and disturb her profound meditation when she be weigh the difficulty of kennicot semler and michaelis finding that all the parish particularly the old people be displeased i ask why they allow it ah sir they reply when the steward order what can we poor peasant do but one thing have happen well the steward and the vicar who for once think to reap some advantage from the caprice of hi wife intend to divide the tree between them the revenueoffice be inform of it revive an old claim to the ground where the tree have stand and sell them to the best bidder there they still lie on the ground if i be the sovereign i should know how to deal with them all vicar steward and revenueoffice sovereign do i say i should in that case care little about the tree that grow in the country only to gaze upon her dark eye be to me a source of happiness and what grief me be that albert do not seem so happy a hehoped to beas i should have beenifi be no friend to these pause but here i can not express it otherwise and probably i be explicit enough ossian have supersede homer in my heart to what a world do the illustrious bard carry me to wander over pathless wild surround by impetuous whirlwind where by the feeble light of the moon we see the spirit of our ancestor to hear from the mountaintops mid the roar of torrent their plaintive sound issue from deep cavern and the sorrowful lamentation of a maiden who sigh and expire on the mossy tomb of the warrior by whom she be adore i meet this bard with silver hair he wander in the valley he seek the footstep of hi father and ala he find only their tomb then contemplate the pale moon a she sink beneath the wave of the roll sea the memory of bygone day strike the mind of the hero day when approach danger invigorate the brave and the moon shone upon hi bark laden with spoil and return in triumph when i read in hi countenance deep sorrow when i see hi die glory sink exhaust into the grave a he inhale new and heartthrilling delight from hi approach union with hi beloved and he cast a look on the cold earth and the tall grass which be so soon to cover him and then exclaim the traveller will comehe will come who have see my beauty and he will ask where be the bard where be the illustrious son of fingal he will walk over my tomb and will seek me in vain then o my friend i could instantly like a true and noble knight draw my sword and deliver my prince from the long and painful languor of a living death and dismiss my own soul to follow the demigod whom my hand have set free ala the void the fearful void which i feel in my bosom sometimes i think if i could only once but once press her to my heart this dreadful void would be fill yes i feel certain wilhelm and every day i become more certain that the existence of any be whatever be of very little consequence a friend of charlotte call to see her just now i withdraw into a neighbouring apartment and take up a book but finding i could not read i sit down to write i hear them converse in an undertone they speak upon indifferent topic and retail the news of the town one be go to be marry another be ill very ill she have a dry cough her face be grow thin daily and she have occasional fit ni very unwell too say charlotte hi limbs begin to swell already answer the other and my lively imagination carry me at once to the bed of the infirm there i see them struggle against death with all the agony of pain and horror and these woman wilhelm talk of all this with as much indifference a one would mention the death of a stranger and when i look around the apartment where i now amwhen i see charlotte apparel lie before me and albert writing and all those article of furniture which be so familiar to me even to the very inkstand which i be usingwhen i think what i be to this familyeverything my friend esteem me i often contribute to their happiness and my heart seem a if it could not beat without them and yetif i be to die if i be to be summon from the midst of this circle would they feelor how long would they feel the void which my loss would make in their existence how long yes such be the frailty of man that even there where he have the great consciousness of hi own be where he make the strong and most forcible impression even in the memory in the heart of hi beloved there also he must perishvanishand that quickly i could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little we be capable of influence the feeling of each other no one can communicate to me those sensation of love joy rapture and delight which i do not naturally possess and though my heart may glow with the most lively affection i can not make the happiness of one in whom the same warmth be not inherent evening i possess so much but my love for her absorbs it all i possess so much but without her i have nothing one hundred time have i be on the point of embrace her heaven what a torment it be to see so much loveliness passing and repassing before u and yet not dare to lay hold of it and lay hold be the most natural of human instinct do not child touch everything they see and i witness heaven how often i lie down in my bed with a wish and even a hope that i may never awaken again and in the morning when i open my eye i behold the sun once more and be wretched if i be whimsical i might blame the weather or an acquaintance or some personal disappointment for my discontented mind and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself but alas i feel it too sadly i be alone the cause of my own woe be i not truly my own bosom contain the source of all my sorrow a it previously contain the source of all my pleasure be i not the same be who once enjoy an excess of happiness who at every step saw paradise open before him and whose heart be ever expand toward the whole world and this heart be now dead no sentiment can revive it my eye be dry and my sens no more refresh by the influence of soft tear wither and consume my brain i suffer much for i have lose the only charm of life that active sacred power which create world around meit be no more when i look from my window at the distant hill and behold the morning sun breaking through the mist and illuminate the country around which be still wrap in silence whilst the soft stream wind gently through the willow which have shed their leaf when glorious nature display all her beauty before me and her wondrous prospect be ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart i feel that in such a moment i stand like a reprobate before heaven harden insensible and unmoved oftentimes do i then bend my knee to the earth and implore god for the blessing of tear a the despond labourer in some scorch climate prays for the dew of heaven to moisten hi parched corn but i feel that god do not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate entreaty and oh those bygone day whose memory now torment me why be they so fortunate because i then wait with patience for the blessing of the eternal and receive hi gift with the grateful feeling of a thankful heart charlotte have reprove me for my excess with so much tenderness and goodness i have lately be in the habit of drink more wine than heretofore dont do it she say think of charlotte think of you i answer need you bid me do so think of youi do not think of you you be ever before my soul this very morning i sit on the spot where a few day ago you descend from the carriage and she immediately change the subject to prevent me from pursue it far my dear friend my energy be all prostrated she can do with me what she please i thank you wilhelm for your cordial sympathy for your excellent advice and i implore you to be quiet leave me to my suffering in spite of my wretchedness i have still strength enough for endurance i revere religionyou know i do i feel that it can impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflict but do it affect all men equally consider this vast universe you will see thousand for whom it have never exist thousand for whom it will never exist whether it be preach to them or not and must it then necessarily exist for me do not the son of god himself say that they be hi whom the father have give to him have i be give to him what if the father will retain me for himself a my heart sometimes suggest i pray you do not misinterpret this do not extract derision from my harmless word i pour out my whole soul before you silence be otherwise preferable to me but i need not shrink from a subject of which few know more than i do myself what be the destiny of man but to fill up the measure of hi suffering and to drink hi allotted cup of bitterness and if that same cup prove bitter to the god of heaven under a human form why should i affect a foolish pride and call it sweet why should i be ashamed of shrink at that fearful moment when my whole be will tremble between existence and annihilation when a remembrance of the past like a flash of lightning will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity when everything shall dissolve around me and the whole world vanish away be not this the voice of a creature oppress beyond all resource selfdeficient about to plunge into inevitable destruction and groan deeply at it inadequate strength my god my god why hast thou forsake me and should i feel ashamed to utter the same expression should i not shudder at a prospect which have it fear even for him who fold up the heaven like a garment she do not feel she do not know that she be prepare a poison which will destroy u both and i drink deeply of the draught which be to prove my destruction what mean those look of kindness with which she oftenoften no not often but sometimes regard me that complacency with which she hear the involuntary sentiment which frequently escape me and the tender pity for my suffering which appear in her countenance yesterday when i take leave she seize me by the hand and say adieu dear werther dear werther it be the first time she ever call me dear the sound sunk deep into my heart i have repeat it a hundred time and last night on go to bed and talk to myself of various thing i suddenly say good night dear werther and then could not but laugh at myself i can not pray leave her to me and yet she often seem to belong to me i can not pray give her to me for she be anothers in this way i affect mirth over my trouble and if i have time i could compose a whole litany of antithesis she be sensible of my suffering this morning her look pierced my very soul i find her alone and she be silent she steadfastly survey me i no longer saw in her face the charm of beauty or the fire of genius these have disappear but i be affect by an expression much more touch a look of the deep sympathy and of the soft pity why be i afraid to throw myself at her foot why do i not dare to take her in my arm and answer her by a thousand kiss she have recourse to her piano for relief and in a low and sweet voice accompany the music with delicious sound her lip never appear so lovely they seem but just to open that they might imbibe the sweet tone which issue from the instrument and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely mouth oh who can express my sensation i be quite overcome and bend down pronounce this vow beautiful lips which the angel guard never will i seek to profane your purity with a kiss and yet my friend oh i wishbut my heart be darken by doubt and indecisioncould i but taste felicity and then die to expiate the sin what sin oftentimes i say to myself thou alone art wretched all other mortal be happy none be distress like thee then i read a passage in an ancient poet and i seem to understand my own heart i have so much to endure have men before me ever be so wretched i shall never be myself again wherever i go some fatality occur to distract me even today alasfor our destiny ala for human nature about dinnertime i go to walk by

existence the editor to the reader it be a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence of the last remarkable day of our friend and we be therefore oblige to interrupt the progress of hi correspondence and to supply the deficiency by a connected narration i have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the mouth of person well acquaint with hi history the story be simple and all the account agree except in some unimportant particular it be true that with respect to the character of the person spoken of opinion and judgment vary we have only then to relate conscientiously the fact which our diligent labour have enable u to collect to give the letter of the deceased and to pay particular attention to the slight fragment from hi pen more especially a it be so difficult to discover the real and correct motif of men who be not of the common order sorrow and discontent have take deep root in werthers soul and gradually impart their character to hi whole be the harmony of hi mind become completely disturb a perpetual excitement and mental irritation which weaken hi natural power produce the sad effect upon him and render him at length the victim of an exhaustion against which he struggle with still more painful effort than he have display even in contend with hi other misfortune hi mental anxiety weaken hi various good quality and he be soon convert into a gloomy companion always unhappy and unjust in hi idea the more wretched he become this be at least the opinion of albert friend they assert moreover that the character of albert himself have undergone no change in the meantime he be still the same be whom werther have love honour and respect from the commencement hi love for charlotte be unbounded he be proud of her and desire that she should be recognise by every one a the noble of created being be he however to blame for wish to avert from her every appearance of suspicion or for hi unwillingness to share hi rich prize with another even for a moment and in the most innocent manner it be assert that albert frequently retire from hi wifes apartment during werthers visit but this do not arise from hatred or aversion to hi friend but only from a feeling that hi presence be oppressive to werther charlotte father who be confine to the house by indisposition be accustom to send hi carriage for her that she might make excursion in the neighbourhood one day the weather have be unusually severe and the whole country be cover with snow werther go for charlotte the following morning in order that if albert be absent he might conduct her home the beautiful weather produce but little impression on hi troubled spirit a heavy weight lay upon hi soul deep melancholy have take possession of him and hi mind know no change save from one painful thought to another a he now never enjoy internal peace the condition of hi fellow creature be to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress he believe he have disturb the happiness of albert and hi wife and whilst he censure himself strongly for this he begin to entertain a secret dislike to albert hi thought be occasionally direct to this point yes he would repeat to himself with illconcealed dissatisfaction yes this be after all the extent of that confide dear tender and sympathetic love that calm and eternal fidelity what do i behold but satiety and indifference doe not every frivolous engagement attract him more than hi charming and lovely wife do he know how to prize hi happiness can he value her a she deserve he possess her it be true i know that a i know much more and i have become accustom to the thought that he will drive me mad or perhaps murder me be hi friendship toward me unimpaired doe he not view my attachment to charlotte a an infringement upon hi right and consider my attention to her a a silent rebuke to himself i know and indeed feel that he dislike me that he wish for my absence that my presence be hateful to him he would often pause when on hi way to visit charlotte stand still a though in doubt and seem desirous of return but would nevertheless proceed and engage in such thought and soliloquy a we have describe he finally reach the huntinglodge with a sort of involuntary consent upon one occasion he enter the house and inquire for charlotte he observe that the inmate be in a state of unusual confusion the eldest boy inform him that a dreadful misfortune have occur at walheimthat a peasant have be murder but this make little impression upon him enter the apartment he find charlotte engage reason with her father who in spite of hi infirmity insist on go to the scene of the crime in order to institute an inquiry the criminal be unknown the victim have be find dead at hi own door that morning suspicion be excite the murdered man have be in the service of a widow and the person who have previously fill the situation have be dismiss from her employment as soon a werther hear this he exclaim with great excitement be it possible i must go to the spoti can not delay a moment he hasten to walheim every incident return vividly to hi remembrance and he entertain not the slight doubt that that man be the murderer to whom he have so often spoken and for whom he entertain so much regard hi way take him past the wellknown lime tree to the house where the body have be carry and hi feeling be greatly excite at the sight of the fondly recollected spot that threshold where the neighbours child have so often play together be stain with blood love and attachment the noble feeling of human nature have be convert into violence and murder the huge tree stand there leafless and cover with hoarfrost the beautiful hedgerows which surround the old churchyard wall be wither and the gravestone half cover with snow be visible through the opening a he approach the inn in front of which the whole village be assemble scream be suddenly hear a troop of armed peasant be see approach and every one exclaim that the criminal have be apprehend werther look and be not long in doubt the prisoner be no other than the servant who have be formerly so attached to the widow and whom he have meet prowl about with that suppress anger and illconcealed despair which we have before describe what have you do unfortunate man inquire werther a he advance toward the prisoner the latter turn hi eye upon him in silence and then reply with perfect composure no one will now marry her and she will marry no one the prisoner be take into the inn and werther leave the place the mind of werther be fearfully excite by this shock occurrence he cease however to be oppress by hi usual feeling of melancholy moroseness and indifference to everything that pass around him he entertain a strong degree of pity for the prisoner and be seize with an indescribable anxiety to save him from hi impend fate he consider him so unfortunate he deem hi crime so excusable and think hi own condition so nearly similar that he felt convinced he could make every one els view the matter in the light in which he saw it himself he now become anxious to undertake hi defence and commence compose an eloquent speech for the occasion and on hi way to the huntinglodge he could not refrain from speak aloud the statement which he resolve to make to the judge upon hi arrival he find albert have be before him and he be a little perplexed by this meeting but he soon recover himself and express hi opinion with much warmth to the judge the latter shook hi head doubtingly and although werther urge hi case with the utmost zeal feeling and determination in defence of hi client yet a we may easily suppose the judge be not much influence by hi appeal on the contrary he interrupt him in hi address reason with him seriously and even administer a rebuke to him for become the advocate of a murderer he demonstrate that accord to this precedent every law might be violate and the public security utterly destroy he add moreover that in such a case he could himself do nothing without incur the great responsibility that everything must follow in the usual course and pursue the ordinary channel werther however do not abandon hi enterprise and even beseech the judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner but this proposal be peremptorily reject albert who have take some part in the discussion coincide in opinion with the judge at this werther become enraged and take hi leave in great anger after the judge have more than once assure him that the prisoner could not be save the excess of hi grief at this assurance may be infer from a note we have find amongst hi paper and which be doubtless write upon this very occasion you can not be save unfortunate man i see clearly that we can not be save werther be highly incense at the observation which albert have make to the judge in this matter of the prisoner he think he could detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally and although upon reflection it could not escape hi sound judgment that their view of the matter be correct he felt the great possible reluctance to make such an admission a memorandum of werthers upon this point expressive of hi general feeling toward albert have be find amongst hi paper what be the use of my continually repeat that he be a good and estimable man he be an inward torment to me and i be incapable of be just toward him one fine evening in winter when the weather seem inclined to thaw charlotte and albert be return home together the former look from time to time about her a if she miss werthers company albert begin to speak of him and censure him for hi prejudice he allude to hi unfortunate attachment and wish it be possible to discontinue hi acquaintance i desire it on our own account he add and i request you will compel him to alter hi deportment toward you and to visit you less frequently the world be censorious and i know that here and there we be speak of charlotte make no reply and albert seem to feel her silence at least from that time he never again spoke of werther and when she introduce the subject he allow the conversation to die away or els he direct the discourse into another channel the vain attempt werther have make to save the unhappy murderer be the last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguish he sink almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and inactivity until he be at length bring to perfect distraction by learn that he be to be summon a a witness against the prisoner who assert hi complete innocence hi mind now become oppress by the recollection of every misfortune of hi past life the mortification he have suffer at the ambassador and hi subsequent trouble be revive in hi memory he become utterly inactive destitute of energy he be cut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the business of common life and he become a victim to hi own susceptibility and to hi restless passion for the most amiable and beloved of woman whose peace he destroy in this unvarying monotony of existence hi day be consume and hi power become exhaust without aim or design until they bring him to a sorrowful end a few letter which he leave behind and which we here subjoin afford the best proof of hi anxiety of mind and of the depth of hi passion as well a of hi doubt and struggle and of hi weariness of life dear wilhelm i be reduce to the condition of those unfortunate wretch who believe they be pursue by an evil spirit sometimes i be oppress not by apprehension or fear but by an inexpressible internal sensation which

pistol for a journey adieu charlotte have sleep little during the past night all her apprehension be realise in a way that she could neither foresee nor avoid her blood be boil in her vein and a thousand painful sensation rent her pure heart be it the ardour of werthers passionate embrace that she felt within her bosom be it anger at hi daring be it the sad comparison of her present condition with former day of innocence tranquillity and selfconfidence how could she approach her husband and confess a scene which she have no reason to conceal and which she yet felt nevertheless unwilling to avow they have preserve so long a silence toward each other and should she be the first to break it by so unexpected a discovery she fear that the mere statement of werthers visit would trouble him and hi distress would be heighten by her perfect candour she wish that he could see her in her true light and judge her without prejudice but be she anxious that he should read her inmost soul on the other hand could she deceive a be to whom all her thought have ever be expose as clearly a crystal and from whom no sentiment have ever be conceal these reflection make her anxious and thoughtful her mind still dwell on werther who be now lose to her but whom she could not bring herself to resign and for whom she know nothing be leave but despair if she should be lose to him for ever a recollection of that mysterious estrangement which have lately subsist between herself and albert and which she could never thoroughly understand be now beyond measure painful to her even the prudent and the good have before now hesitate to explain their mutual difference and have dwell in silence upon their imaginary grievance until circumstance have become so entangled that in that critical juncture when a calm explanation would have save all party an understanding be impossible and thus if domestic confidence have be earlier establish between them if love and kind forbearance have mutually animate and expand their heart it might not perhaps even yet have be too late to save our friend but we must not forget one remarkable circumstance we may observe from the character of werthers correspondence that he have never affect to conceal hi anxious desire to quit this world he have often discuss the subject with albert and between the latter and charlotte it have not unfrequently form a topic of conversation albert be so opposed to the very idea of such an action that with a degree of irritation unusual in him he have more than once give werther to understand that he doubt the seriousness of hi threat and not only turn them into ridicule but cause charlotte to share hi feeling of incredulity her heart be thus tranquillise when she felt disposed to view the melancholy subject in a serious point of view though she never communicate to her husband the apprehension she sometimes experience albert upon hi return be receive by charlotte with illconcealed embarrassment he be himself out of humour hi business be unfinished and he have just discover that the neighbour official with whom he have to deal be an obstinate and narrowminded personage many thing have occur to irritate him he inquire whether anything have happen during hi absence and charlotte hastily answer that werther have be there on the evening previously he then inquire for hi letter and be answer that several package have be leave in hi study he thereon retire leave charlotte alone the presence of the be she love and honour produce a new impression on her heart the recollection of hi generosity kindness and affection have calm her agitation a secret impulse prompt her to follow him she take her work and go to hi study a be often her custom he be busily employ opening and read hi letter it seem a if the content of some be disagreeable she ask some question he give short answer and sit down to write several hour pass in this manner and charlotte feeling become more and more melancholy she felt the extreme difficulty of explain to her husband under any circumstance the weight that lay upon her heart and her depression become every moment great in proportion a she endeavour to hide her grief and to conceal her tear the arrival of werthers servant occasion her the great embarrassment he give albert a note which the latter coldly hand to hi wife say at the same time give him the pistol i wish him a pleasant journey he add turn to the servant these word fell upon charlotte like a thunderstroke she rise from her seat halffainting and unconscious of what she do she walk mechanically toward the wall take down the pistol with a tremble hand slowly wipe the dust from them and would have delay longer have not albert hasten her movement by an impatient look she then deliver the fatal weapon to the servant without be able to utter a word as soon a he have depart she fold up her work and retire at once to her room her heart overcome with the most fearful foreboding she anticipate some dreadful calamity she be at one moment on the point of go to her husband throw herself at hi foot and acquaint him with all that have happen on the previous evening that she might acknowledge her fault and explain her apprehension then she saw that such a step would be useless a she would certainly be unable to induce albert to visit werther
