these particular be for the climate of london but my meaning be perceive that you may have ver perpetuum a the place affords and because the breath of flower be far sweeter in the air where it come and go like the warbling of music than in the hand therefore nothing be more fit for that delight than to know what be the flower and plant that do best perfume the air rose damask and red be fast flower of their smell so that you may walk by a whole row of them and find nothing of their sweetness yea though it be in a morning dew bay likewise yield no smell a they grow rosemary little nor sweet marjoram that which above all other yield the sweet smell in the air be the violet especially the white double violet which come twice a year about the middle of april and about bartholomewtide next to that be the muskrose then the strawberry leave die with a most excellent cordial smell then the flower of the vinesit be a little dust like the dust of a bent which grow uponthe cluster in the first come forth then sweetbrier then wallflower which be very delightful to be set under a parlour or low chamber window then pink and gilliflowers especially the matted pink and clovegilliflower then the flower of the lime tree then the honeysuckle so they be somewhat afar off of bean flower i speak not because they be field flower but those which perfume the air most delightfully not pass by a the rest but be trodden uponand crush be three that be burnet wild thyme and water mint therefore you be to set whole alley of them to have the pleasure when you walk or tread for garden speaking of those which be indeed princelike a we have do of building the content ought not well to be under thirty acre of ground and to be divide into three part a green in the entrance a heath or desert in the go forth and the main garden in the midst besides alley on both side and i like well that four acre of ground be assign to the green six to the heath four and four to either side and twelve to the main garden the green hath two pleasures the one because nothing be more pleasant to the eye than green grass keep finely shorn the other because it will give you a fair alley in the midst by which you may go in front upona stately hedge which be to inclose the garden but because the alley will be long and in great heat of the year or day you ought not to buy the shade in the garden by go in the sun through the green therefore you be of either side the green to plant a covert alley uponcarpenter work about twelve foot in height by which you may go in shade into the garden a for the making of knot or re with diver colour earth that they may lie under the window of the house on that side which the garden stand they be but toy you may see a good sight many time in tart the garden be best to be square encompass on all the four side with a stately arch hedge the arch to be upon
