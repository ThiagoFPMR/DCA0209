all this while ambrosio be unconscious of the dreadful scene which be pass so near the execution of hi design upon antonia employ hi every thought hitherto he be satisfy with the success of hi plan antonia have drink the opiate be bury in the vault of st clare and absolutely in hi disposal matilda who be well acquaint with the nature and effect of the soporific medicine have compute that it would not cease to operate till one in the morning for that hour he wait with impatience the festival of st clare present him with a favourable opportunity of consummate hi crime he be certain that the friar and nun would be engage in the procession and that he have no cause to dread an interruption from appear himself at the head of hi monk he have desire to be excuse he doubt not that be beyond the reach of help cut off from all the world and totally in hi power antonia would comply with hi desire the affection which she have ever exprest for him warrant this persuasion but he resolve that should she prove obstinate no consideration whatever should prevent him from enjoy her secure from a discovery he shudder not at the idea of employ force if he felt any repugnance it arise not from a principle of shame or compassion but from hi feeling for antonia the most sincere and ardent affection and wish to owe her favour to no one but herself the monk quit the abbey at midnight matilda be among the chorister and lead the chaunt ambrosio be leave by himself and at liberty to pursue hi own inclination convince that no one remain behind to watch hi motion or disturb hi pleasure he now hasten to the western aisle hi heart beat with hope not unmingled with anxiety he cross the garden unlock the door which admit him into the cemetery and in a few minute he stand before the vault here he pause he look round him with suspicion conscious that hi business be unfit for any other eye a he stand in hesitation he hear the melancholy shriek of the screechowl the wind rattle loudly against the window of the adjacent convent and a the current swept by him bore with it the faint note of the chaunt of chorister he open the door cautiously a if fearing to be overheard he enter and close it again after him guide by hi lamp he thread the long passage in whose winding matilda have instruct him and reach the private vault which contain hi sleeping mistress it entrance be by no mean easy to discover but this be no obstacle to ambrosio who at the time of antonias funeral have observe it too carefully to be deceive he find the door which be unfasten push it open and descend into the dungeon he approach the humble tomb in which antonia repose he have provide himself with an iron crow and a pickaxe but this precaution be unnecessary the grate be slightly fasten on the outside he raise it and place the lamp upon it ridge bent silently over the tomb by the side of three putrid halfcorrupted body lay the sleep beauty a lively red the forerunner of return animation have already spread itself over her cheek and a wrapped in her shroud she recline upon her funeral bier she seem to smile at the image of death around her while he gaze upon their rotting bone and disgust figure who perhaps be once a sweet and lovely ambrosio think upon elvira by him reduce to the same state a the memory of that horrid act glance upon hi mind it be cloud with a gloomy horror yet it serve but to strengthen hi resolution to destroy antonias honour for your sake fatal beauty murmur the monk while gaze on hi devote prey for your sake have i commit this murder and sell myself to eternal torture now you be in my power the produce of my guilt will at least be mine hope not that your prayer breathe in tone of unequalled melody your bright eye fill with tear and your hand lift in supplication a when seek in penitence the virgin pardon hope not that your move innocence your beauteous grief or all your suppliant art shall ransom you from my embrace before the break of day mine you must and mine you shall be he lift her still motionless from the tomb he seat himself upon a bank of stone and support her in hi arm watch impatiently for the symptom of return animation scarcely could he command hi passion sufficiently to restrain himself from enjoy her while yet insensible hi natural lust be increase in ardour by the difficulty which have oppose hi satisfy it a also by hi long abstinence from woman since from the moment of resign her claim to hi love matilda have exile him from her arm for ever i be no prostitute ambrosio had she tell him when in the fullness of hi lust he demand her favour with more than usual earnestness i be now no more than your friend and will not be your mistress cease then to solicit my comply with desire which insult me while your heart be mine i glory in your embrace those happy time be past my person be become indifferent to you and tis necessity not love which make you seek my enjoyment i can not yield to a request so humiliate to my pride suddenly deprive of pleasure the use of which have make them an absolute want the monk felt this restraint severely naturally addict to the gratification of the sens in the full vigour of manhood and heat of blood he have suffer hi temperament to acquire such ascendency that hi lust be become madness of hi fondness for antonia none but the grosser particle remain he long for the possession of her person and even the gloom of the vault the surround silence and the resistance which he expect from her seem to give a fresh edge to hi fierce and unbridled desire gradually he felt the bosom which rest against hi glow with return warmth her heart throbbed again her blood flow swifter and her lip move at length she open her eye but still opprest and bewilder by the effect of the strong opiate she close them again immediately ambrosio watch her narrowly nor permit a movement to escape him perceive that she be fully restore to existence he catch her in rapture to hi bosom and closely press hi lip to hers the suddenness of hi action suffice to dissipate the fume which obscure antonias reason she hastily raise herself and cast a wild look round her the strange image which present themselves on every side contribute to confuse her she put her hand to her head a if to settle her disordered imagination at length she take it away and throw her eye through the dungeon a second time they fix upon the abbot face where be i she say abruptly how come i here where be my mother methought i saw her oh a dream a dreadful dreadful dream tell me but where be i let me go i

i think it and such must my antonia yes my sweet girl yes your vein shall glow with fire which circle in mine and my transport shall be double by your share them while he speak thus he repeat hi embrace and permit himself the most indecent liberty even antonias ignorance be not proof against the freedom of hi behaviour she be sensible of her danger force herself from hi arm and her shroud be her only garment she wrap it closely round her unhand me father she cry her honest indignation temper by alarm at her unprotected position why have you bring me to this place it appearance freeze me with horror convey me from hence if you have the least sense of pity and humanity let me return to the house which i have quit i know not how but stay here one moment long i neither will or ought though the monk be somewhat startle by the resolute tone in which this speech be deliver it produce upon him no other effect than surprize he catch her hand force her upon hi knee and gaze upon her with gloting eye he thus reply to her compose yourself antonia resistance be unavailing and i need disavow my passion for you no long you be imagine dead society be for ever lose to you i possess you

become more ardent and antonias terror more intense she struggle to disengage herself from hi arm her exertion be unsuccessful and find that ambrosios conduct become still freer she shriek for assistance with all her strength the aspect of the vault the pale glimmering of the lamp the surround obscurity the sight of the tomb and the object of mortality which meet her eye on either side be illcalculated to inspire her with those emotion by which the friar be agitate even hi caress terrify her from their fury and create no other sentiment than fear on the contrary her alarm her evident disgust and incessant opposition seem only to inflame the monk desire and supply hi brutality with additional strength antonias shriek be unheard yet she continue them nor abandon her endeavour to escape till exhaust and out of breath she sink from hi arm upon her knee and once more have recourse to prayer and supplication this attempt have no good success than the former on the contrary taking advantage of her situation the ravisher throw himself by her side he clasp her to hi bosom almost lifeless with terror and faint with struggle he stifle her cry with kiss treat her with the rudeness of an unprincipled barbarian proceed from freedom to freedom and in the violence of hi lustful delirium wound and bruise her tender limb heedless of her tear cry and entreaty he gradually make himself master of her person and desist not from hi prey till he have accomplish hi crime and the dishonour of antonia scarcely have he succeed in hi design than he shudder at himself and the mean by which it be effect the very excess of hi former eagerness to possess antonia now contribute to inspire him with disgust and a secret impulse make him feel how base and unmanly be the crime which he have just commit he start hastily from her arm she who so lately have be the object of hi adoration now raise no other sentiment in hi heart than aversion and rage he turn away from her or if hi eye rest upon her figure involuntarily it be only to dart upon her look of hate the unfortunate have faint ere the completion of her disgrace she only recover life to be sensible of her misfortune she remain stretched upon the earth in silent despair the tear chase each other slowly down her cheek and her bosom heave with frequent sob oppress with grief she continue for some time in this state of torpidity at length she rise with difficulty and drag her feeble step towards the door prepare to quit the dungeon the sound of her footstep rouzed the monk from hi sullen apathy start from the tomb against which he recline while hi eye wander over the image of corruption contain in it he pursue the victim of hi brutality and soon overtake her he seize her by the arm and violently force her back into the dungeon whither go you he cry in a stern voice return this instant antonia tremble at the fury of hi countenance what would you more she say with timidity be not my ruin compleated am i not undo undone for ever be not your cruelty content or have i yet more to suffer let me depart let me return to my home and weep unrestrained my shame and my affliction return to your home repeat the monk with bitter and contemptuous mockery then suddenly hi eye flame with passion what that you may denounce me to the world that you may proclaim me an hypocrite a ravisher a betrayer a monster of cruelty lust and ingratitude no no no i know well the whole weight of my offence well that your complaint would be too just and my crime too notorious you shall not from hence to tell madrid that i be a villain that my conscience be load with sin which make me despair of heaven pardon wretched girl you must stay here with me here amidst these lonely tombs these image of death these rot loathsome corrupt body here shall you stay and witness my suffering witness what it be to die in the horror of despondency and breathe the last groan in blasphemy and curse and who be i to thank for this what seduce me into crime whose bare remembrance make me shudder fatal witch be it not thy beauty have you not plunge my soul into infamy have you not make me a perjured hypocrite a ravisher an assassin nay at this moment do not that angel look bid me despair of god forgiveness oh when i stand before hi judgmentthrone that look will suffice to damn me you will tell my judge that you be happy till i saw you that you be innocent till i pollute you you will come with those tearful eye those cheek pale and ghastly those hand lift in supplication a when you seek from me that mercy which i give not then will my perdition be certain then will come your mother ghost and hurl me down into the dwelling of fiend and flame and fury and everlasting torment and ti you who will accuse me ti you who will cause my eternal anguish you wretched girl you you a he thunder out these word he violently grasp antonias arm and spurn the earth with delirious fury suppose hi brain to be turn antonia sank in terror upon her knee she lift up her hand and her voice almost die away ere she could give it utterance spare me spare me she murmur with difficulty silence cry the friar madly and dash her upon the ground he quit her and pace the dungeon with a wild and disorder air hi eye roll fearfully antonia tremble whenever she meet their gaze he seem to meditate on something horrible and she give up all hope of escape from the sepulchre with life yet in harbour this idea she do him injustice amidst the horror and disgust to which hi soul be a prey pity for hi victim still hold a place in it the storm of passion once over he would have give world have he possest them to have restore to her that innocence of which hi unbridled lust have deprive her of the desire which have urge him to the crime no trace be leave in hi bosom the wealth of india would not have tempt him to a second enjoyment of her person hi nature seem to revolt at the very idea and fain would he have wipe from hi memory the scene which have just past a hi gloomy rage abate in proportion do hi compassion augment for antonia he stop and would have speak to her word of comfort but he know not from whence to draw them and remain gaze upon her with mournful wildness her situation seem so hopeless so woebegone a to baffle mortal power to relieve her what could he do for her her peace of mind be lose her honour irreparably ruin she be cut off for ever from society nor dare he give her back to it he be conscious that be she to appear in the world again hi guilt would be reveal and hi punishment inevitable to one so laden with crime death come arm with double terror yet should he restore antonia to light and stand the chance of her betray him how miserable a prospect would present itself before her she could never hope to be creditably establish she would be mark with infamy and condemn to sorrow and solitude for the remainder of her existence what be the alternative a resolution far more terrible for antonia but which at least would insure the abbot safety he determine to leave the world persuade of her death and to retain her a captive in this gloomy prison there he propose to visit her every night to bring her food to profess hi penitence and mingle hi tear with hers the monk felt that this resolution be unjust and cruel but it be hi only mean to prevent antonia from publish hi guilt and her own infamy should he release her he could not depend upon her silence hi offence be too flagrant to permit hi hop for her forgiveness besides her reappearing would excite universal curiosity and the violence of her affliction would prevent her from conceal it cause he determine therefore that antonia should remain a prisoner in the dungeon he approach her with confusion paint on hi countenance he raise her from the ground her hand tremble a he take it and he drop it again a if he have touch a serpent nature seem to recoil at the touch he felt himself at once repulse from and attract towards her yet could account for neither sentiment there be something in her look which penetrate him with horror and though hi understanding be still ignorant of it conscience point out to him the whole extent of hi crime in hurried accent yet the gentlest he could find while hi eye be avert and hi voice scarcely audible he strive to console her under a misfortune which now could not be avoid he declare himself sincerely penitent and that he would gladly shed a drop of hi blood for every tear which hi barbarity have force from her wretched and hopeless antonia listen to him in silent grief but when he announce her confinement in the sepulchre that dreadful doom to which even death seem preferable rouse her from her insensibility at once to linger out a life of misery in a narrow loathsome cell know to exist by no human being save her ravisher surround by moulder corse breathe the pestilential air of corruption never more to behold the light or drink the pure gale of heaven the idea be more terrible than she could support it conquer even her abhorrence of the friar again she sink upon her knee she beseech hi compassion in term the most pathetic and urgent she promise would he but restore her to liberty to conceal her injury from the world to assign any reason for her reappearance which he might judge proper and in order to prevent the least suspicion from fall upon him she offer to quit madrid immediately her entreaty be so urgent a to make a considerable impression upon the monk he reflect that a her person no longer excite hi desire he have no interest in keep her concealed a he have at first intend that he be add a fresh injury to those which she have already suffer and that if she adhere to her promise whether she be confine or at liberty hi life and reputation be equally secure on the other hand he tremble l in her affliction antonia should unintentionally break her engagement or that her excessive simplicity and ignorance of deceit should permit some one more artful to surprize her secret however wellfounded be these apprehension compassion and a sincere wish to repair hi fault as much a possible solicit hi comply with the prayer of hi suppliant the difficulty of colour antonias unexpected return to life after her supposed death and public interment be the only point which keep him irresolute he be still ponder on the mean of remove this obstacle when he hear the sound of foot approach with precipitation the door of the vault be throw open and matilda rush in evidently much confuse and terrify on see a stranger enter antonia utter a cry of joy but her hope of receive succour from him be soon dissipate the suppose novice without express the least surprize at find a woman alone with the monk in so strange a place and at so late an hour address him thus without lose a moment what be to be do ambrosio we be lose unless some speedy mean be find of dispel the rioter ambrosio the convent of st clare be on fire the prioress have fall a victim to the fury of the mob already be the abbey menace with a similar fate alarmed at the threat of the people the monk seek for you everywhere they imagine that your authority alone will suffice to calm this disturbance no one know what be become of you and your absence create universal astonishment and despair i profit by the confusion and flee hither to warn you of the danger this will soon be remedied answer the abbot i will hasten back to my cell a trivial reason will account for my have be miss impossible rejoin matilda the sepulchre be fill with archer lorenzo de medina with several officer of the inquisition search through the vault and pervades every passage you will be intercept in your flight your reason for be at this late hour in the sepulchre will be examine antonia will be find and then you be undone for ever lorenzo de medina officer of the inquisition what bring them here seek they for me be i then suspect oh speak matilda answer me in pity a yet they do not think of you but i fear that they will ere long your only chance of escape their notice rest upon the difficulty of explore this vault the door be artfully hidden haply it may not be observe and we may remain concealed till the search be over but antonia should the inquisitor draw near and her cry be hear thus i remove that danger interrupt matilda at the same time draw a poignard she rush upon her devote prey hold hold cry ambrosio seize her hand and wresting from it the already lift weapon what would you do cruel woman the unfortunate have already suffer but too much thanks to your pernicious consels would to god that i have never follow them would to god that i have never see your face matilda dart upon him a look of scorn absurd she exclaim with an air of passion and majesty which impress the monk with awe after rob her of all that make it dear can you fear to deprive her of a life so miserable but tis well let her live to convince you of your folly i abandon you to your evil destiny i disclaim your alliance who tremble to commit so insignificant a crime deserve not my protection hark hark ambrosio hear you not the archer they come and your destruction be inevitable at this moment the abbot hear the sound of distant voice he fly to close the door on whose concealment hi safety depend and which matilda have neglect to fasten ere he could reach it he saw antonia glide suddenly by him rush through the door and fly towards the noise with the swiftness of an arrow she have listen attentively to matilda she hear lorenzos name mention and resolve to risque every thing to throw herself under hi protection the door be open the sound convince her that the archer could be at no great distance she muster up her little remaining strength rush by the monk ere he perceive her design and bent her course rapidly towards the voice as soon a he recover from hi first surprize the abbot fail not to pursue her in vain do antonia redouble her speed and stretch every nerve to the utmost her enemy gain upon her every moment she hear hi step close after her and felt the heat of hi breath glow upon her neck he overtake her he twist hi hand in the ringlet of her stream hair and attempt to drag her back with him to the dungeon antonia resist with all her strength she fold her arm round a pillar which support the roof and shriek loudly for assistance in vain do the monk strive to threaten her to silence help she continue to exclaim help help for god sake quicken by her cry the sound of footstep be hear approach the abbot expect every moment to see the inquisitor arrive antonia still resist and he now enforce her silence by mean the most horrible and inhuman he still grasp matildas dagger without allow himself a moment reflection he raise it and plunge it twice in the bosom of antonia she shriek and sink upon the ground the monk endeavour to bear her away with him but she still embrace the pillar firmly at that instant the light of approach torch flash upon the wall dread a discovery ambrosio be compel to abandon hi victim and hastily flee back to the vault where he have leave matilda he flee not unobserved don ramirez happen to arrive the first perceive a female bleeding upon the ground and a man fly from the spot whose confusion betray him for the murderer he instantly pursue the fugitive with some part of the archer while the other remain with lorenzo to protect the wounded stranger they raise her and support her in their arm she have faint from excess of pain but soon give sign of return life she open her eye and on lift up her head the quantity of fair hair fell back which till then have obscure her feature god almighty it be antonia such be lorenzos exclamation while he snatch her from the attendant arm and clasp her in hi own though aim by an uncertain hand the poignard have answer but too well the purpose of it employer the wound be mortal and antonia be conscious that she never could recover yet the few moment which remain for her be moment of happiness the concern exprest upon lorenzos countenance the frantic fondness of hi complaint and hi earnest enquiry respect her wound convince her beyond a doubt that hi affection be her own she would not be remove from the vault fear l motion should only hasten her death and she be unwilling to lose those moment which she past in receive proof of lorenzos love and assure him of her own she tell him that have she still be undefiled she might have lament the loss of life but that deprive of honour and brand with shame death be to her a blessing she could not have be hi wife and that hope be deny her she resign herself to the grave without one sigh of regret she bad him take courage conjure him not to abandon himself to fruitless sorrow and declare that she mourn to leave nothing in the whole world but him while every sweet accent increase rather than lighten lorenzos grief she continue to converse with him till the moment of dissolution her voice grow faint and scarcely audible a thick cloud spread itself over her eye her heart beat slow and irregular and every instant seem to announce that her fate be near at hand she lay her head recline upon lorenzos bosom and her lip still murmur to him word of comfort she be interrupt by the convent bell a toll at a distance it strike the hour suddenly antonias eye sparkle with celestial brightness her frame seem to have receive new strength and animation she start from her lover arm three oclock she cry mother i come she clasp her hand and sank lifeless upon the ground lorenzo in agony throw himself beside her he tear hi hair beat hi breast and refuse to be separate from the corse at length hi force be exhaust he suffer himself to be lead from the vault and be convey to the palace de medina scarcely more alive than the unfortunate antonia in the meanwhile though closely pursue ambrosio succeed in regain the vault the door be already fasten when don ramirez arrive and much time elapse ere the fugitive retreat be discover but nothing can resist perseverance though so artfully conceal the door could not escape the vigilance of the archer they force it open and enter the vault to the infinite dismay of ambrosio and hi companion the monk confusion hi attempt to hide himself hi rapid flight and the blood sprinkle upon hi cloaths leave no room to doubt hi be antonias murderer but when he be recognize for the immaculate ambrosio the man of holiness the idol of madrid the faculty of the spectator be chain up in surprize and scarcely could they persuade themselves that what they saw be no vision the abbot strive not to vindicate himself but preserve a sullen silence he be secure and bound the same precaution be take with matilda her cowl be remove the delicacy of her feature and profusion of her golden hair betray her sex and this incident create fresh amazement the dagger be also find in the tomb where the monk have throw it and the dungeon have undergone a thorough search the two culprit be convey to the prison of the inquisition don ramirez take care that the populace should remain ignorant both of the crime and profession of the captive he fear a repetition of the riot which have follow the apprehend the prioress of st clare he content himself with state to the capuchin the guilt of their superior to avoid the shame of a public accusation and dread the popular fury from which they have already save their abbey with much difficulty the monk readily permit the inquisitor to search their mansion without noise no fresh discovery be make the effect find in the abbot and matildas cell be seize and carry to the inquisition to be produce in evidence every thing els remain in it former position and order and tranquillity once more prevailed through madrid st clares convent be completely ruin by the united ravage of the mob and conflagration nothing remain of it but the principal wall whose thickness and solidity have preserve them from the flame the nun who have belong to it be oblige in consequence to disperse themselves into other society but the prejudice against them run high and the superior be very unwilling to admit them however most of them be relate to family the most distinguish for their rich birth and power the several convent be compel to receive them though they do it with a very ill grace this prejudice be extremely false and unjustifiable after a close investigation it be prove that all in the convent be persuade of the death of agnes except the four nun whom st ursula have point out these have fall victim to the popular fury a have also several who be perfectly innocent and unconscious of the whole affair blind by resentment the mob have sacrifice every nun who fell into their hand they who escape be entirely indebted to the duke de medina prudence and moderation of this they be conscious and felt for that nobleman a proper sense of gratitude virginia be not the most sparing of her thanks she wish equally to make a proper return for hi attention and to obtain the good grace of lorenzos uncle in this she easily succeed the duke behold her beauty with wonder and admiration and while hi eye be enchant with her form the sweetness of her manner and her tender concern for the suffering nun prepossess hi heart in her favour this virginia have discernment enough to perceive and she redouble her attention to the invalid when he part from her at the door of her father palace the duke entreat permission to enquire occasionally after her health hi request be readily grant virginia assure him that the marquis de villafranca would be proud of an opportunity to thank him in person for the protection afford to her they now separate he enchant with her beauty and gentleness and she much please with him and more with hi nephew on enter the palace virginia first care be to summon the family physician and take care of her unknown charge her mother hasten to share with her

all side to inform him that he would find her safe at hi hotel and desire him to hasten thither immediately hi absence give virginia liberty to bestow her whole attention upon her patient and though much disorder herself by the adventure of the night no persuasion could induce her to quit the bedside of the sufferer her constitution be much enfeeble by want and sorrow it be some time before the stranger be restore to her sens she find great difficulty in swallow the medicine prescribe to her but this obstacle be remove she easily conquer her disease which proceed from nothing but weakness the attention which be pay her the wholesome food to which she have be long a stranger and her joy at be restore to liberty to society and a she dare to hope to love all this combine to her speedy reestablish from the first moment of know her her melancholy situation her suffering almost unparalleled have engage the affection of her amiable hostess virginia felt for her the most lively interest but how be she delight when her guest be sufficiently recover to relate her history she recognize in the captive nun the sister of lorenzo this victim of monastic cruelty be indeed no other than the unfortunate agnes during her abode in the convent she have be well know to virginia but her emaciated form her feature alter by affliction her death universally credit and her overgrown and mat hair which hung over her face and bosom in disorder at first have prevent her be recollect the prioress have put every artifice in practice to induce virginia to take the veil for the heiress of villafranca would have be no despicable acquisition her seeming kindness and unremitted attention so far succeeded that her young relation begin to think seriously upon compliance better instruct in the disgust and ennui of a monastic life agnes have penetrate the design of the domina she tremble for the innocent girl and endeavour to make her sensible of her error she paint in their true colour the numerous inconveniencies attach to a convent the continue restraint the low jealousy the petty intrigue the servile court and gross flattery expect by the superior she then bad virginia reflect on the brilliant prospect which present itself before her the idol of her parent the admiration of madrid endow by nature and education with every perfection of person and mind she might look forward to an establishment the most fortunate her rich furnish her with the mean of exercise in their full extent charity and benevolence those virtue so dear to her and her stay in the world would enable her discover object worthy her protection which could not be do in the seclusion of a convent her persuasion induce virginia to lay aside all thought of the veil but another argument not use by agnes have more weight with her than all the other put together she have see lorenzo when he visit hi sister at the grate hi person please her and her conversation with agnes generally use to terminate in some question about her brother she who dot upon lorenzo wish for no good than an opportunity to trumpet out hi praise she speak of him in term of rapture and to convince her auditor how just be hi sentiment how cultivate hi mind and elegant hi expression she show her at different time the letter which she receive from him she soon perceive that from these communication the heart of her young friend have imbibe impression which she be far from intend to give but be truly happy to discover she could not have wish her brother a more desirable union heiress of villafranca virtuous affectionate beautiful and accomplish virginia seem calculated to make him happy she sound her brother upon the subject though without mention name or circumstance he assure her in hi answer that hi heart and hand be totally disengage and she think that upon these ground she might proceed without danger she in consequence endeavour to strengthen the dawn passion of her friend lorenzo be make the constant topic of her discourse and the avidity with which her auditor listen the sigh which frequently escape from her bosom and the eagerness with which upon any digression she bring back the conversation to the subject whence it have wander suffice to convince agnes that her brother address would be far from disagreeable she at length venture to mention her wish to the duke though a stranger to the lady herself he know enough of her situation to think her worthy hi nephews hand it be agree between him and hi niece that she should insinuate the idea to lorenzo and she only wait hi return to madrid to propose her friend to him a hi bride the unfortunate event which take place in the interim prevent her from execute her design virginia weep her loss sincerely both a a companion and a the only person to whom she could speak of lorenzo her passion continue to prey upon her heart in secret and she have almost determine to confess her sentiment to her mother when accident once

him of antonias death and lorenzos behaviour on the occasion make evident hi mistake he lament the circumstance but the unhappy girl be effectually out of the way he trust that hi design would yet be execute ti true that lorenzos situation just then illsuited him for a bridegroom hi hope disappoint at the moment when he expect to realize them and the dreadful and sudden death of hi mistress have affect him very severely the duke find him upon the bed of sickness hi attendant express serious apprehension for hi life but the uncle entertain not the same fear he be of opinion and not unwisely that men have die and worm have eat them but not for love he therefore flatter himself that however deep might be the impression make upon hi nephew heart time and virginia would be able to efface it he now hasten to the afflict youth and endeavour to console him he sympathise in hi distress but encourage him to resist the encroachment of despair he allow that he could not but feel shock at an event so terrible nor could he blame hi sensibility but he beseech him not to torment himself with vain regret and rather to struggle with affliction and preserve hi life if not for hi own sake at least for the sake of those who be fondly attach to him while he labour thus to make lorenzo forget antonias loss the duke pay hi court assiduously to virginia and seize every opportunity to advance hi nephews interest in her heart it may easily be expect that agnes be not long without enquire after don raymond she be shock to hear the wretched situation to which grief have reduce him yet she could not help exult secretly when she reflect that hi illness prove the sincerity of hi love the duke undertake the office himself of announce to the invalid the happiness which await him though he omit no precaution to prepare him for such an event at this sudden change from despair to happiness raymonds transport be so violent a nearly to have prove fatal to him these once pass the tranquillity of hi mind the assurance of felicity and above all the presence of agnes who be no sooner reestablish by the care of virginia and the marchioness than she hasten to attend her lover soon

first recount the discovery which have take place in the abbey chapel the dominas resentment and the midnight scene of which st ursula have be a concealed witness though the nun have already describe this latter event agnes now relate it more circumstantially and at large after which she proceed in her narrative a follow my suppose death be attend with the great agony those moment which i believe my last be embitter by the dominas assurances that i could not escape perdition and a my eye close i hear her rage exhale itself in curse on my offence the horror of this situation of a deathbed from which hope be banish of a sleep from which i be only to wake to find myself the prey of flame and fury be more dreadful than i can describe when animation revive in me my soul be still impress with these terrible idea i look round with fear expect to behold the minister of divine vengeance for the first hour my sens be so bewildered and my brain so dizzy that i strive in vain to arrange the strange image which float in wild confusion before me if i endeavour to raise myself from the ground the wandering of my head deceive me every thing around me seem to rock and i sink once more upon the earth my weak and dazzled eye be unable to bear a near approach to a gleam of light which i saw tremble above me i be compel to close them again and remain motionless in the same posture a full hour elapse before i be sufficiently myself to examine the surrounding object when i do examine them what terror fill my bosom i find myself extend upon a sort of wicker couch it have six handle to it which doubtless have serve the nun to convey me to my grave i be cover with a linen cloth several fade flower be strown over me on one side lay a small wooden crucifix on the other a rosary of large bead four low narrow wall confine me the top be also cover and in it be practise a small grated door through this be admit the little air which circulate in this miserable place a faint glimmering of light which stream through the bar permit me to distinguish the surround horror i be opprest by a noisome suffocating smell and perceiving that the grated door be unfasten i think that i might possibly effect my escape a i raise myself with this design my hand rest upon something soft i grasp it and advance it towards the light almighty god what be my disgust my consternation in spite of it putridity and the worm which prey upon it i perceive a corrupted human head and recognise the feature of a nun who have die some month before i throw it from me and sink almost lifeless upon my bier when my strength return this circumstance and the consciousness of be surround by the loathsome and moulder body of my companion increase my desire to escape from my fearful prison i again move towards the light the grated door be within my reach i lift it without difficulty probably it have be leave unclosed to facilitate my quit the dungeon aid myself by the irregularity of the wall some of whose stone project beyond the rest i contrive to ascend them and drag myself out of my prison i now find myself in a vault tolerably spacious several tomb similar in appearance to that whence i have just escape be range along the side in order and seem to be considerably sunk within the earth a sepulchral lamp be suspend from the roof by an iron chain and shed a gloomy light through the dungeon emblem of death be see on every side skull shoulderblades thighbone and other leaving of mortality be scatter upon the dewy ground each tomb be ornament with a large crucifix and in one corner stand a wooden statue of st clare to these object i at first pay no attention a door the only outlet from the vault have attract my eye i hasten towards it have wrap my windingsheet closely round me i push against the door and to my inexpressible terror find that it be fasten on the outside i guess immediately that the prioress mistake the nature of the liquor which she have compel me to drink instead of poison have administer a strong opiate from this i conclude that be to all appearance dead i have receive the rite of burial and that deprive of the power of make my existence know it would be my fate to expire of hunger this idea penetrate me with horror not merely for my own sake but that of the innocent creature who still live within my bosom i again endeavour to open the door but it resist all my effort i stretch my voice to the extent of it compass and shriek for aid i be remote from the hearing of every one no friendly voice reply to mine a profound and melancholy silence prevail through the vault and i despair of liberty my long abstinence from food now begin to torment me the torture which hunger inflict on me be the most painful and insupportable yet they seem to increase with every hour which past over my head sometimes i throw myself upon the ground and roll upon it wild and desperate sometimes start up i return to the door again strive to force it open and repeated my fruitless cry for succour often be i on the point of strike my temple against the sharp corner of some monument dash out my brain and thus terminate my woe at once but still the remembrance of my baby vanquish my resolution i tremble at a deed which equally endanger my child existence and my own then would i vent my anguish in loud exclamation and passionate complaint and then again my strength fail me silent and hopeless i would sit me down upon the base of st clares statue fold my arm and abandon myself to sullen despair thus pass several wretched hour death advance towards me with rapid stride and i expect that every succeeding moment would be that of my dissolution suddenly a neighbouring tomb catch my eye a basket stand upon it which till then i have not observe i start from my seat i make towards it as swiftly a my exhausted frame would permit how eagerly do i seize the basket on find it to contain a loaf of coarse bread and a small bottle of water i throw myself with avidity upon these humble aliment they have to all appearance be place in the vault for several day the bread be hard and the water taint yet never do i taste food to me so delicious when the craving of appetite be satisfied i busy myself with conjecture upon this new circumstance i debate whether the basket have be place there with a view to my necessity hope answer my doubt in the affirmative yet who could guess me to be in need of such assistance if my existence be know why be i detain in this gloomy vault if i be keep a prisoner what mean the ceremony of commit me to the tomb or if i be doom to perish with hunger to whose pity be i indebted for provision place within my reach a friend would not have keep my dreadful punishment a secret neither do it seem probable that an enemy would have take pain to supply me with the mean of existence upon the whole i be incline to think that the dominas design upon my life have be discover by some one of my partizan in the convent who have find mean to substitute an opiate for poison that she have furnish me with food to support me till she could effect my delivery and that she be then employ in give intelligence to my relation of my danger and point out a way to release me from captivity yet why then be the quality of my provision so coarse how could my friend have enter the vault without the dominas knowledge and if she have enter why be the door fasten so carefully these reflection stagger me yet still this idea be the most favourable to my hope and i dwell upon it in preference my meditation be interrupt by the sound of distant footstep they approach but slowly ray of light now dart through the crevice of the door uncertain whether the person who advance come to relieve me or be conduct by some other motive to the vault i fail not to attract their notice by loud cry for help still the sound draw near the light grow strong at length with inexpressible pleasure i hear the key turning in the lock persuade that my deliverance be at hand i fly towards the door with a shriek of joy it open but all my hope of escape die away when the prioress appear follow by the same four nun who have be witness of my suppose death they bore torch in their hand and gaze upon me in fearful silence i start back in terror the domina descend into the vault a do also her companion she bend upon me a stern resentful eye but express no surprize at find me still live she take the seat which i have just quit the door be again closed and the nun range themselves behind their superior while the glare of their torch dim by the vapour and dampness of the vault gild with cold beam the surrounding monument for some moment all preserve a dead and solemn silence i stand at some distance from the prioress at length she beckon me to advance trembling at the severity of her aspect my strength scarce suffice me to obey her i draw near but my limb be unable to support their burthen i sink upon my knee i clasp my hand and lift them up to her for mercy but have no power to articulate a syllable she gaze upon me with angry eye do i see a penitent or a criminal she say at length be those hand raise in contrition for your crime or in fear of meet their punishment do those tear acknowledge the justice of your doom or only solicit mitigation of your suffering i fear me ti the latter she pause but keep her eye still fixt upon mine take courage she continue i wish not for your death but your repentance the draught which i administer be no poison but an opiate my intention in deceive you be to make you feel the agony of a guilty conscience have death overtaken you suddenly while your crime be still unrepented you have suffer those agony i have bring you to be familiar with the sharpness of death and i trust that your momentary anguish will prove to you an eternal benefit it be not my design to destroy your immortal soul or bid you seek the grave burthen with the weight of sin unexpiated no daughter far from it i will purify you with wholesome chastisement and furnish you with full leisure for contrition and remorse hear then my sentence the illjudged zeal of your friend delay it execution but can not now prevent it all madrid believe you to be no more your relation be thoroughly persuade of your death and the nun your partizan have assist at your funeral your existence can never be suspect i have take such precaution a must render it an impenetrable mystery then abandon all thought of a world from which you be eternally separate and employ the few hour which be allow you in prepare for the next this exordium lead me to expect something terrible i tremble and would have speak to deprecate her wrath but a motion of the domina command me to be silent she proceed though of late year unjustly neglect and now oppose by many of our misguided sister whom heaven convert it be my intention to revive the law of our order in their full force that against incontinence be severe but no more than so monstrous an offence demand submit to it daughter without resistance you will find the benefit of patience and resignation in a good life than this listen then to the sentence of st clare beneath these vault there exist prison intend to receive such criminal a yourself artfully be their entrance conceal and she who enter them must resign all hope of liberty thither

coarse weep daughter weep and moisten your bread with your tear god know that you have ample cause for sorrow chain down in one of these secret dungeon shut out from the world and light for ever with no comfort but religion no society but repentance thus must you groan away the remainder of your day such be st clares order submit to them without repine follow me thunderstruck at this barbarous decree my little remaining strength abandon me i answer only by fall at her foot and bath them with tear the domina unmoved by my affliction rise from her seat with a stately air she repeat her command in an absolute tone but my excessive faintness make me unable to obey her mariana and alix raise me from the ground and carry me forward in their arm the prioress move on lean upon violante and camilla precede her with a torch thus pass our sad procession along the passage in silence only break by my sigh and groan we stop before the principal shrine of st clare the statue be remove from it pedestal though how i know not the nun afterwards raise an iron grate till then conceal by the image and let it fall on the other side with a loud crash the awful sound repeat by the vault above and cavern below me rouzed me from the despondent apathy in which i have be plunge i look before me an abyss present itself to my affrighted eye and a steep and narrow staircase whither my conductor be lead me i shriek and start back i implore compassion rent the air with my cry and summon both heaven and earth to my assistance in vain i be hurry down the staircase and force into one of the cell which line the cavern side my blood run cold a i gaze upon this melancholy abide the cold vapour hovering in the air the wall green with damp the bed of straw so forlorn and comfortless the chain destine to bind me for ever to my prison and the reptile of every description which a the torch advance towards them i descry hurry to their retreat strike my heart with terror almost too exquisite for nature to bear drive by despair to madness i burst suddenly from the nun who hold me i throw myself upon my knee before the prioress and beseech her mercy in the most passionate and frantic term if not on me say i look at least with pity on that innocent being whose life be attach to mine great be my crime but let not my child suffer for it my baby have commit no fault oh spare me for the sake of my unborn offspring whom ere it taste life your severity doom to destruction the prioress draw back haughtily she force her habit from my grasp a if my touch have be contagious what she exclaim with an exasperated air what dare you plead for the produce of your shame shall a creature be permit to live conceive in guilt so monstrous abandoned woman speak for him no more well that the wretch should perish than live begotten in perjury incontinence and pollution it can not fail to prove a prodigy of vice hear me thou guilty expect no mercy from me either for yourself or brat rather pray that death may seize you before you produce it or if it must see the light that it eye may immediately be close again for ever no aid shall be give you in your labour bring your offspring into the world yourself fee it yourself nurse it yourself bury it yourself god grant that the latter may happen soon l you receive comfort from the fruit of your iniquity this inhuman speech the threat which it contain the dreadful suffering foretell to me by the domina and her prayer for my infant death on whom though unborn i already doated be more than my exhausted frame could support utter a deep groan i fell senseless at the foot of my unrelenting enemy i know not how long i remain in this situation but i imagine that some time must have elapse before my recovery since it suffice the prioress and her nun to quit the cavern when my sens return i find myself in silence and solitude i hear not even the retire footstep of my persecutor all be hush and all be dreadful i have be throw upon the bed of straw the heavy chain which i have already eye with terror be wind around my waist and fasten me to the wall a lamp glimmer with dull melancholy ray through my dungeon permit my distinguish all it horror it be separate from the cavern by a low and irregular wall of stone a large chasm be leave open in it which form the entrance for door there be none a leaden crucifix be in front of my straw couch a tattered rug lay near me a do also a chaplet of bead and not far from me stand a pitcher of water and a wicker basket contain a small loaf and a bottle of oil to supply my lamp with a despondent eye do i examine this scene of suffer when i reflect that i be doom to pass in it the remainder of my day my heart be rent with bitter anguish i have once be teach to look forward to a lot so different at one time my prospect have appear so bright so flatter now all be lose to me friend comfort society happiness in one moment i be deprive of all dead to the world dead to pleasure i live to nothing but the sense of misery how fair do that world seem to me from which i be for ever exclude how many love object do it contain whom i never should behold again a i throw a look of terror round my prison a i shrink from the cut wind which howl through my subterraneous dwell the change seem so striking so abrupt that i doubt it reality that the duke de medina niece that the destined bride of the marquis de la cisterna one breed up in affluence relate to the noble family in spain and rich in a multitude of affectionate friend that she should in one moment become a captive separate from the world for ever weigh down with chain and reduce to support life with the coarse aliment appear a change so sudden and incredible that i believe myself the sport of some frightful vision it continuance convince me of my mistake with but too much certainty every morning my hope be disappoint at length i abandon all idea of escape i resign myself to my fate and only expect liberty when she come the companion of death my mental anguish and the dreadful scene in which i have be an actress advance the period of my labour in solitude and misery abandon by all unassisted by art uncomforted by friendship with pang which if witness would have touch the hard heart be i deliver of my wretched burthen it come alive into the world but i know not how to treat it or by what mean to preserve it existence i could only bathe it with tear warm it in my bosom and offer up prayer for it safety i be soon deprive of this mournful employment the want of proper attendance my ignorance how to nurse it the bitter cold of the dungeon and the unwholesome air which inflate it lung terminate my sweet babe short and painful existence it expire in a few hour after it birth and i witness it death with agony which beggar all description but my grief be unavailing my infant be no more nor could all my sigh impart to it little tender frame the breath of a moment i rent my windingsheet and wrap in it my lovely child i place it on my bosom it soft arm fold round my neck and it pale cold cheek rest upon mine thus do it lifeless limb repose while i cover it with kiss talk to it weep and moan over it without remission day or night camilla enter my prison regularly once every twentyfour hour to bring me food in spite of her flinty nature she could not behold this spectacle unmoved she fear that grief so excessive would at length turn my brain and in truth i be not always in my proper sens from a principle of compassion she urge me to permit the corse to be bury but to this i never would consent i vow not to part with it while i have life it presence be my only comfort and no persuasion could induce me to give it up it soon become a mass of putridity and to every eye be a loathsome and disgust object to every eye but a mother in vain do human feeling bid me recoil from this emblem of mortality with repugnance i withstand and vanquish that repugnance i persist in hold my infant to my bosom in lament it love it adore it hour after hour have i pass upon my sorry couch contemplate what have once be my child i endeavour to retrace it feature through the livid corruption with which they be overspread during my confinement this sad occupation be my only delight and at that time world should not have bribe me to give it up even when release from my prison i bring away my child in my arm the representation of my two kind friendshere she take the hand of the marchioness and virginia and press them alternately to her lipsat length persuade me to resign my unhappy infant to the grave yet i part from it with reluctance however reason at length prevail i suffer it to be take from me and it now repose in consecrate ground i before mention that regularly once a day camilla bring me food she seek not to embitter my sorrow with reproach she bad me ti true resign all hope of liberty and worldly happiness but she encourage me to bear with patience my temporary distress and advise me to draw comfort from religion my situation evidently affect her more than she venture to express but she believe that to extenuate my fault would make me less anxious to repent it often while her lip paint the enormity of my guilt in glare colour her eye betray how sensible she be to my suffering in fact i be certain that none of my tormentor for the three other nun enter my prison occasionally be so much actuate by the spirit of oppressive cruelty a by the idea that to afflict my body be the only way to preserve my soul nay even this persuasion might not have have such weight with them and they might have think my punishment too severe have not their good disposition be represt by blind obedience to their superior her resentment exist in full force my project of elopement have be discover by the abbot of the capuchin she suppose herself lower in hi opinion by my disgrace and in consequence her hate be inveterate she tell the nun to whose custody i be commit that my fault be of the most heinous nature that no suffering could equal the offence and that nothing could save me from eternal perdition but punish my guilt with the utmost severity the superior word be an oracle to but too many of a convent inhabitants the nun believe whatever the prioress choose to assert though contradict by reason and charity they hesitate not to admit the truth of her argument they follow her injunction to the very letter and be fully persuade that to treat me with lenity or to show the least pity for my woe would be a direct mean to destroy my chance for salvation camilla be most employ about me be particularly charge by the prioress to treat me with harshness in compliance with these order she frequently strive to convince me how just be my punishment and how enormous be my crime she bad me think myself too happy in save my soul by mortify my body and even threaten me sometimes with eternal perdition yet a i before observe she always conclude by word of encouragement and comfort and though uttered by camillas lip i easily recognise the dominas expression once and once only the prioress visit me in my dungeon she then treat me with the most unrelenting cruelty she load me with reproach taunt me with my frailty and when i implore her mercy tell me to ask it of heaven since i deserve none on earth she even gaze upon my lifeless infant without emotion and when she leave me i hear her charge camilla to increase the hardship of my captivity unfeeling woman but let me check my resentment she have expiate her error by her sad and unexpected death peace be with her and may her crime be forgive in heaven a i forgive her my suffering on earth thus do i drag on a miserable existence far from grow familiar with my prison i behold it every moment with new horror the cold seem more piercing and bitter the air more thick and pestilential my frame become weak feverish and emaciate i be unable to rise from the bed of straw and exercise my limb in the narrow limit to which the length of my chain permit me to move though exhausted faint and weary i tremble to profit by the approach of sleep my slumber be constantly interrupt by some obnoxious insect crawling over me sometimes i felt the bloat toad hideous and pampered with the poisonous vapour of the dungeon drag hi loathsome length along my bosom sometimes the quick cold lizard rouzed me leave hi slimy track upon my face and entangle itself in the tress of my wild and matted hair often have i at wake find my finger ring with the long worm which breed in the corrupted flesh of my infant at such time i shriek with terror and disgust and while i shake off the reptile tremble with all a woman weakness such be my situation when camilla be suddenly take ill a dangerous fever suppose to be infectious confine her to her bed every one except the laysister appoint to nurse her avoid her with caution and fear to catch the disease she be perfectly delirious and by no mean capable of attend to me the domina and the nun admit to the mystery have latterly give me over entirely to camillas care in consequence they busy themselves no more about me and occupy by prepare for the approach festival it be more than probable that i never once enter into their thought of the reason of camillas negligence i have be inform since my release by the mother st ursula at that time i be very far from suspect it cause on the contrary i wait for my gaoler appearance at first with impatience and afterwards with despair one day pass away another follow it the third arrive still no camilla still no food i know the lapse of time by the wasting of my lamp to supply which fortunately a week supply of oil have be leave me i suppose either that the nun have forget me or that the domina have order them to let me perish the latter idea seem the most probable yet so natural be the love of life that i tremble to find it true though embitter by every specie of misery my existence be still dear to me and i dread to lose it every succeed minute prove to me that i must abandon all hope of relief i be become an absolute skeleton my eye already fail me and my limb be begin to stiffen i could only express my anguish and the pang of that hunger which gnaw my heartstrings by frequent groan whose melancholy sound the vaulted roof of the dungeon reechoed i resign myself to my fate i already expect the moment of dissolution when my guardian angel when my beloved brother arrive in time to save me my sight grown dim and feeble at first refuse to recognize him and when i do distinguish hi feature the sudden burst of rapture be too much for me to bear i be overpower by the swell of joy at once more behold a friend and that a friend so dear to me nature could not support my emotion and take her refuge in insensibility you already know what be my obligation to the family of villafranca but what you can not know be the extent of my gratitude boundless a the excellence of my benefactor lorenzo raymond name so dear to me teach me to bear with fortitude this sudden transition from misery to bliss so lately a captive opprest with chain perish

sustain the weight one only wish remains ungratified it be to see my brother in hi former health and to know that antonias memory be bury in her grave grant this prayer i have nothing more to desire i trust that my past suffering have purchase from heaven the pardon of my momentary weakness that i have offend offend greatly and grievously i be fully conscious but let not my husband because he once conquer my virtue doubt the propriety of my future conduct i have be frail and full of error but i yield not to the warmth of constitution raymond affection for you betray me i be too confident of my
