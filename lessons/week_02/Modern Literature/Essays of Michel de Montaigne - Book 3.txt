no man be free from speak foolish thing but the bad ont be when a man labour to play the fool this do not concern me mine slip from me with as little care a they be of little value and tis the good for them i would presently part with them for what they be worth and neither buy nor sell them but a they weigh i speak on paper a i do to the first person i meet and that this be true observe what follow to whom ought not treachery to be hateful when tiberius refuse it in a thing of so great importance to him he have word send him from germany that if he think fit they would rid him of arminius by poison this be the most potent enemy the roman have who have defeat them so ignominiously under varus and who alone prevent their aggrandisement in those part he return answer that the people of rome be wont to revenge themselves of their enemy by open way and with their sword in their hand and not clandestinely and by fraud wherein he quit the profitable for the honest you will tell me that he be a braggadocio i believe so too and tis no great miracle in men of hi profession but the acknowledgment of virtue be not less valid in the mouth of him who hat it forasmuch a truth force it from him and if he will not inwardly receive it he at least put it on for a decoration our outward and inward structure be full of imperfection but there be nothing useless in nature not even inutility itself nothing have insinuate itself into this universe that have not therein some fit and proper place our be be cement with sickly quality ambition jealousy envy revenge superstition and despair have so natural a possession in u that it image be discern in beast nay and cruelty so unnatural a vice for even in the midst of compassion we feel within i know not what tartsweet titillation of illnatured pleasure in see other suffer and the child feel it of the seed of which quality whoever should divest man would destroy the fundamental condition of human life likewise in all government there be necessary office not only abject but vicious also vices there help to make up the seam in our piecing a poison be useful for the conservation of health if they become excusable because they be of use to u and that the common necessity cover their true quality we be to resign this part to the strong and bold citizen who sacrifice their honour and conscience a other of old sacrifice their life for the good of their country we who be weak take upon u part both that be more easy and less hazardous the public weal require that men should betray and lie and massacre let u leave this commission to men who be more obedient and more supple in earnest i have often be trouble to see judge by fraud and false hope of favour or pardon allure a criminal to confess hi fact and therein to make use of cozenage and impudence it would become justice and plato himself who countenance this manner of proceed to furnish me with other mean more suitable to my own liking this be a malicious kind of justice and i look upon it a no le wound by itself than by other i say not long since to some company in discourse that i should hardly be draw to betray my prince for a particular man who should be much ashamed to betray any particular man for my prince and i do not only hate deceive myself but that any one should deceive through me i will neither afford matter nor occasion to any such thing in the little i have have to mediate betwixt our prince in the division and subdivision by which we be at this time tear to piece i have be very careful that they should neither be deceive in me nor deceive other by me people of that kind of trading be very reserved and pretend to be the most moderate imaginable and near to the opinion of those with whom they have to do i expose myself in my stiff opinion and after a method the most my own a tender negotiator a novice who have rather fail in the affair than be want to myself and yet it have be hitherto with so good luck for fortune have doubtless the best share in it that few thing have pass from hand to hand with less suspicion or more favour and privacy i have a free and open way that easily insinuate itself and obtain belief with those with whom i be to deal at the first meeting sincerity and pure truth in what age soever pas for current and besides the liberty and freedom of a man who treat without any interest of hi own be never hateful or suspected and he may very well make use of the answer of hyperides to the athenian who complain of hi blunt way of speaking monsieur do not consider whether or no i be free but whether i be so without a bribe or without any advantage to my own affair my liberty of speaking have also easily clear me from all suspicion of dissembling by it vehemency leave nothing unsaid how home and bitter soever so that i could have say no bad behind their back and in that it carry along with it a manifest show of simplicity and indifference i pretend to no other fruit by act than to act and add to it no long argument or proposition every action play it own game win if it can a to the rest i be not sway by any passion either of love or hatred towards the great nor have my will captivate either by particular injury or obligation i look upon our king with an affection simply loyal and respectful neither prompt nor restrain by any private interest and i love myself for it nor do the general and just cause attract me otherwise than with moderation and without heat i be not subject to those penetrate and close compact and engagement anger and hatred be beyond the duty of justice and be passion only useful to those who do not keep themselves strictly to their duty by simple reason all legitimate intention be temperate and equable of themselves if otherwise they degenerate into seditious and unlawful this be it which make me walk everywhere with my head erect my face and my heart open in truth and i be not afraid to confess it i should easily in case of need hold up one candle to st michael and another to hi dragon like the old woman i will follow the right side even to the fire but exclusively if i can let montaigne be overwhelm in the public ruin if need be but if there be no need i should think myself oblige to fortune to save me and i will make use of all the length of line my duty allow for hi preservation be it not atticus who be of the just but lose side preserve himself by hi moderation in that universal shipwreck of the world amongst so many mutation and diversity for private man a he be it be more easy and in such kind of work i think a man may justly not be ambitious to offer and insinuate himself for a man indeed to be waver and irresolute to keep hi affection unmoved and without inclination in the trouble of hi country and public division i neither think it handsome nor honest this may be allow in our neighbour affair and thus gelo the tyrant of syracuse suspend hi inclination in the war betwixt the greek and barbarian keep a resident ambassador with present at delphos to watch and see which way fortune would incline and then take fit occasion to fall in with the victor it would be a kind of treason to proceed after this manner in our own domestic affair wherein a man must of necessity be of the one side or the other though for a man who have no office or express command to call him out to sit still i hold it more excusable and yet i do not excuse myself upon these term than in foreign expedition to which however accord to our law no man be press against hi will and yet even those who wholly engage themselves in such a war may behave themselves with such temper and moderation that the storm may fly over their head without do them any harm have we not reason to hope such an issue in the person of the late bishop of orleans the sieur de morvilliers and i know amongst those who behave themselves most bravely in the present war some whose manner be so gentle obliging and just that they will certainly stand firm whatever event heaven be prepare for u i be of opinion that it properly belong to kings only to quarrel with king and i laugh at those spirit who out of lightness of heart lend themselves to so disproportioned dispute for a man have never the more particular quarrel with a prince by march openly and boldly against him for hi own honour and accord to hi duty if he do not love such a person he do well he esteem him and notably the cause of the law and of the ancient government of a kingdom have this always annex to it that even those who for their own private interest invade them excuse if they do not honour the defender but we be not a we nowadays do to call peevishness and inward discontent that spring from private interest and passion duty nor a treacherous and malicious conduct courage they call their proneness to mischief and violence zeal ti not the cause but their interest that inflame them they kindle and begin a war not because it be just but because it be war a man may very well behave himself commodiously and loyally too amongst those of the adverse party carry yourself if not with the same equal affection for that be capable of different measure at least with an affection moderate well temper and such a shall not so engage you to one party that it may demand all you be able to do for that side content yourself with a moderate proportion of their favour and goodwill and to swim in troubled water without fish in them the other way of offer a man self and the utmost service he be able to do both to one party and the other have still less of prudence in it than conscience doe not he to whom you betray another to whom you be as welcome a to himself know that you will at another time do as much for him he hold you for a villain and in the meantime hear what you will say gather intelligence from you and work hi own end out of your disloyalty doubled men be useful for bring in but we must have a care they carry out as little a be possible i say nothing to one party that i may not upon occasion say to the other with a little alteration of accent and report nothing but thing either indifferent or know or what be of common consequence i can not permit myself for any consideration to tell them a lie what be intrust to my secrecy i religiously conceal but i take a few trust of that nature upon me a i can the secret of prince be a troublesome burthen to such a be not interested in them i very willingly bargain that they trust me with little but confidently rely upon what i tell them i have ever know more than i desire one open way of speaking introduces another open way of speaking and draw out discovery like wine and love philippides in my opinion answer king lysimachus very discreetly who ask him what of hi estate he should bestow upon him what you will say he provide it be none of your secret i see every one be displease if the bottom of the affair be conceal from him wherein he be employ or that there be any reservation in the thing for my part i be content to know no more of the business than what they would have me employ myself in nor desire that my knowledge should exceed or restrict what i have to say if i must serve for an instrument of deceit let it be at least with a safe conscience i will not be repute a servant either so affectionate or so loyal a to be fit to betray any one he who be unfaithful to himself be excusably so to hi master but they be prince who do not accept men by half and despise limited and conditional service i can not help it i frankly tell them how far i can go for a slave i should not be but to reason and i can hardly submit even to that and they also be to blame to exact from a freeman the same subjection and obligation to their service that they do from him they have make and buy or whose fortune particularly and expressly depend upon theirs the law have deliver me from a great anxiety they have choose a side for me and give me a master all other superiority and obligation ought to be relative to that and cut off from all other yet this be not to say that if my affection should otherwise incline me my hand should presently obey it the will and desire be a law to themselves but action must receive commission from the public appointment all this proceeding of mine be a little dissonant from the ordinary form it would produce no great effect nor be of any long duration innocence itself could not in this age of ours either negotiate without dissimulation or traffic without lie and indeed public employment be by no mean for my palate what my profession require i perform after the most private manner that i can being young i be engage up to the ear in business and it succeed well but i disengage myself in good time i have often since avoid meddling in it rarely accept and never ask it keep my back still turn to ambition but if not like rower who so advance backward yet so at the same time that i be less obliged to my resolution than to my good fortune that i be not wholly embark in it for there be way less displease to my taste and more suitable to my ability by which if she have formerly call me to the public service and my own advancement towards the world opinion i know i should in spite of all my own argument to the contrary have pursue them such a commonly say in opposition to what i profess that what i call freedom simplicity and plainness in my manner be art and subtlety and rather prudence than goodness industry than nature good sense than good luck do me more honour than disgrace but certainly they make my subtlety too subtle and whoever have follow me close and pryed narrowly into me i will give him the victory if he do not confess that there be no rule in their school that could match this natural motion and maintain an appearance of liberty and licence so equal and inflexible through so many various and crooked path and that all their wit and endeavour could never have lead them through the way of truth be one and simple that of particular profit and the commodity of affair a man be entrust with be double unequal and casual i have often see these counterfeit and artificial liberty practise but for the most part without success they relish of aesop as who in emulation of the dog obligingly clap hi two forefoot upon hi master shoulder but a many caress a the dog have for such an expression of kindness twice so many blow with a cudgel have the poor as for hi compliment i will not deprive deceit of it due that be but ill to understand the world i know it have often be of great use and that it maintain and supply most mens employment there be vice that be lawful a there be many action either good or excusable that be not lawful in themselves the justice which in itself be natural and universal be otherwise and more nobly order than that other justice which be special national and constrain to the end of government insomuch that the sage dandamis hear the life of socrates pythagoras and diogenes read judge them to be great men every way except that they be too much subject to the reverence of the law which to second and authorise true virtue must abate very much of it original vigour many vicious action be introduce not only by their permission but by their advice i follow the common phrase that distinguish betwixt profitable and honest thing so a to call some natural action that be not only profitable but necessary dishonest and foul but let u proceed in our example of treachery two pretender to the kingdom of thrace be fall into dispute about their title the emperor hinder them from proceed to blow but one of them under colour of bring thing to a friendly issue by an interview have invite hi competitor to an entertainment in hi own house imprison and kill him justice require that the roman should have satisfaction for this offence but there be a difficulty in obtain it by ordinary way what therefore they could not do legitimately without war and without danger they resolve to do by treachery and what they could not honestly do they do profitably for which end one pomponius flaccus be find to be a fit instrument this man by dissembled word and assurance have draw the other into hi toil instead of the honour and favour he have promise him send him bound hand and foot to rome here one traitor betray another contrary to common custom for they be full of mistrust and tis hard to overreach them in their own art witness the sad experience we have lately have let who will be pomponius flaccus and there be enough who would for my part both my word and my faith be like all the rest part of this common body their best effect be the public service this i take for presuppose but should one command me to take charge of the court of law and lawsuit i should make answer that i understand it not or the place of a leader of pioneer i would say that i be call to a more honourable employment so likewise he that would employ me to lie betray and forswear myself though not to assassinate or to poison for some notable service i should say if i have rob or steal anything from any man send me rather to the galley for it be permissible in a man of honour to say a the lacedaemonians do have be defeat by antipater when just upon conclude an agreement you may impose a heavy and ruinous tax upon u a you please but to command u to do shameful and dishonest thing you will lose your time for it be to no purpose every one ought to make the same vow to himself that the king of egypt make their judge solemnly swear that they would not do anything contrary to their conscience though never so much command to it by themselves in such commission there be evident mark of ignominy and condemnation and he who give it at the same time accuse you and give it if you understand it right for a burden and a punishment as much a the public affair be better by your exploit so much be your own the bad and the good you behave yourself in it tis so much the bad for yourself and it will be no new thing nor peradventure without some colour of justice if the same person ruin you who set you on work if treachery can be in any case excusable it must be only so when it be practise to chastise and betray treachery there be example enough of treachery not only reject but chastise and punish by those in favour of whom they be undertake who be ignorant of fabricius sentence against the physician of pyrrhus but this we also find record that some person have command a thing who afterward have severely avenge the execution of it upon him they have employ reject the reputation of so unbridled an authority and disown so abandon and base a servitude and obedience jaropelk duke of russia tamper with a gentleman of hungary to betray boleslaus king of poland either by kill him or by give the russian opportunity to do him some notable mischief this worthy go ably to work he be more assiduous than before in the service of that king so that he obtain the honour to be of hi council and one of the chiefest in hi trust with these advantage and take an opportune occasion of hi master absence he betray vislicza a great and rich city to the russian which be entirely sack and burn and not only all the inhabitant of both sex young and old put to the sword but moreover a great number of neighbour gentry whom he have draw thither to that end jaropelk hi revenge be thus satisfy and hi anger appease which be not indeed without pretence for boleslaus have highly offend him and after the same manner and sate with the fruit of this treachery come to consider the ful of it with a sound judgment and clear from passion look upon what have be do with so much horror and remorse that he cause the eye to be bore out and the tongue and shameful part to be cut off of him who have perform it antigonus persuade the argyraspides to betray eumenes their general hi adversary into hi hand but after he have cause him so deliver to be slay he would himself be the commissioner of the divine justice for the punishment of so detestable a crime and commit them into the hand of the governor of the province with express command by whatever mean to destroy and bring them all to an evil end so that of that great number of men not so much a one ever return again into macedonia the good he have be serve the more wickedly he judge it to be and merit great punishment the slave who betray the place where hi master p sulpicius lay conceal be accord to the promise of syllas proscription manumit for hi pain but accord to the promise of the public justice which be free from any such engagement he be throw headlong from the tarpeian rock our king clovis instead of the arm of gold he have promise them cause three of cararies servant to be hang after they have betray their master to him though he have debauch them to it he hang them with the purse of their reward about their neck after have satisfy hi second and special faith he satisfy the general and first mohammed ii have resolve to rid himself of hi brother out of jealousy of state accord to the practice of the ottoman family he employ one of hi officer in the execution who pour a quantity of water too fast into him choke him this be do to expiate the murder he deliver the murderer into the hand of the mother of him he have so cause to be put to death for they be only brother by the father side she in hi presence rip up the murderer bosom and with her own hand rifle hi breast for hi heart tear it out and throw it to the dog and even to the bad people it be the sweet thing imaginable have once gain their end by a vicious action to foist in all security into it some show of virtue and justice a by way of compensation and conscientious correction to which may be add that they look upon the minister of such horrid crime a upon men who reproach them with them and think by their death to erase the memory and testimony of such proceeding or if perhaps you be reward not to frustrate the public necessity for that extreme and desperate remedy he who do it can not for all that if he be not such himself but look upon you a an accursed and execrable fellow and conclude you a great traitor than he do against whom you be so for he try the malignity of your disposition by your own hand where he can not possibly be deceive you have no object of precede hatred to move you to such an act but he employ you a they do condemned malefactor in execution of justice an office as necessary a dishonourable besides the baseness of such commission there be moreover a prostitution of conscience see that the daughter of sejanus could not be put to death by the law of rome because she be a virgin she be to make it lawful first ravish by the hangman and then strangle not only hi hand but hi soul be slave to the public convenience when amurath i more grievously to punish hi subject who have take part in the parricide rebellion of hi son ordain that their near kindred should assist in the execution i find it very handsome in some of them to have rather choose to be unjustly think guilty of the parricide of another than to serve justice by a parricide of their own and where i have see at the taking of some little fort by assault in my time some rascal who to save their own life would consent to hang their friend and companion i have look upon them to be of bad condition than those who be hang ti say that witold prince of lithuania introduce into the nation the practice that the criminal condemn to death should with hi own hand execute the sentence think it strange that a third person innocent of the fault should be make guilty of homicide a prince when by some urgent circumstance or some impetuous and unforeseen accident that very much concern hi state compel to forfeit hi word and break hi faith or otherwise force from hi ordinary duty ought to attribute this necessity to a lash of the divine rod vice it be not for he have give up hi own reason to a more universal and more powerful reason but certainly tis a misfortune so that if any one should ask me what remedy none say i if he be really rack between these two extreme sed videat ne quoeratur latebya perjurio he must do it but if he do it without regret if it do not weigh on him to do it tis a sign hi conscience be in a sorry condition if there be a person to be find of so tender a conscience a to think no cure whatever worth so important a remedy i shall like him never the worse he could not more excusably or more decently perish we can not do all we would so that we must often a the last anchorage commit the protection of our vessel to the simple conduct of heaven to what more just necessity do he reserve himself what be less possible for him to do than what he can not do but at the expense of hi faith and honour thing that perhaps ought to be dearer to him than hi own safety or even the safety of hi people though he should with folded arm only call god to hi assistance have he not reason to hope that the divine goodness will not refuse the favour of an extraordinary arm to just and pure hand these be dangerous example rare and sickly exception to our natural rule we must yield to them but with great moderation and circumspection no private utility be of such importance that we should upon that account strain our conscience to such a degree the public may be when very manifest and of very great concern timoleon make a timely expiation for hi strange exploit by the tear he shed call to mind that it be with a fraternal hand that he have slay the tyrant and it justly prick hi conscience that he have be necessitate to purchase the public utility at so great a price a the violation of hi private morality even the senate itself by hi mean deliver from slavery durst not positively determine of so high a fact and divide into two so important and contrary aspect but the syracusans send at the same time to the corinthian to solicit their protection and to require of them a captain fit to reestablish their city in it former dignity and to clear sicily of several little tyrant by whom it be oppress they depute timoleon for that service with this cunning declaration that accord a he should behave himself well or ill in hi employment their sentence should incline either to favour the deliverer of hi country or to disfavour the murderer of hi brother this fantastic conclusion carry along with it some excuse by reason of the danger of the example and the importance of so strange an action and they do well to discharge their own judgment of it and to refer it to other who be not so much concern but timoleons comportment in this expedition soon make hi cause more clear so worthily and virtuously he demean himself upon all occasion and the good fortune that accompany him in the difficulty he have to overcome in this noble employment seem to be strew in hi way by the god favourably conspire for hi justification the end of this matter be excusable if any can be so but the profit of the augmentation of the public revenue that serve the roman senate for a pretence to the foul conclusion i be go to relate be not sufficient to warrant any such injustice certain city have redeem themselves and their liberty by money by the order and consent of the senate out of the hand of l sylla the business come again in question the senate condemn them to be taxable a they be before and that the money they have disburse for their redemption should be lose to them civil war often produce such villainous example that we punish private men for confide in u when we be public minister and the selfsame magistrate make another man pay the penalty of hi change that have nothing to do with it the pedagogue whip hi scholar for hi docility and the guide beat the blind man whom he lead by the hand a horrid image of justice there be rule in philosophy that be both false and weak the example that be propose to u for prefer private utility before faith give have not weight enough by the circumstance they put to it robber have seize you and after have make you swear to pay them a certain sum of money dismiss you tis not well do to say that an honest man can be quit of hi oath without payment be out of their hand ti no such thing what fear have once make me willing to do i be oblige to do it when i be no longer in fear and though that fear only prevail with my tongue without force my will yet be i bind to keep my word for my part when my tongue have sometimes inconsiderately say something that i do not think i have make a conscience of disown it otherwise by degree we shall abolish all the right another derive from our promise and oath and ti only lawful upon the account of private interest to excuse breach of promise when we have promise something that be unlawful and wicked in itself for the right of virtue ought to take place of the right of any obligation of ours i have formerly place epaminondas in the first rank of excellent men and do not repent it how high do he stretch the consideration of hi own particular duty he who never kill a man whom he have overcome who for the inestimable benefit of restore the liberty of hi country make conscience of kill a tyrant or hi accomplice without due form of justice and who conclude him to be a wicked man how good a citizen soever otherwise who amongst hi enemy in battle spar not hi friend and hi guest this be a soul of a rich composition he marry goodness and humanity nay even the tender and most delicate in the whole school of philosophy to the roughest and most violent human action be it nature or art that have intenerated that great courage of hi so full so obstinate against pain and death and poverty to such an extreme degree of sweetness and compassion dreadful in arm and blood he overrun and subdue a nation invincible by all other but by him alone and yet in the heat of an encounter could turn aside from hi friend and guest certainly he be fit to command in war who could so rein himself with the curb of good nature in the height and heat of hi fury a fury inflame and foam with blood and slaughter ti a miracle to be able to mix any image of justice with such violent action and it be only possible for such a steadfastness of mind a that of epaminondas therein to mix sweetness and the facility of the gentle manner and purest innocence and whereas one tell the mamertini that statutes be of no efficacy against arm men and another tell the tribune of the people that the time of justice and of war be distinct thing and a third say that the noise of arm deafen the voice of law this man be not preclude from listen to the law of civility and pure courtesy have he not borrow from hi enemy the custom of sacrifice to the mus when he go to war that they might by their sweetness and gaiety soften hi martial and rigorous fury let u not fear by the example of so great a master to believe that there be something unlawful even against an enemy and that the common concern ought not to require all thing of all men against private interest and that all thing be not lawful to an honest man for the service of hi prince the law or the general quarrel ti an instruction proper for the time wherein we live we need not harden our courage with these arm of steel ti enough that our shoulder be inure to them tis enough to dip our pen in ink without dip them in blood if it be grandeur of courage and the effect of a rare and singular virtue to contemn friendship private obligation a man word and relationship for the common good and obedience to the magistrate ti certainly sufficient to excuse u that tis a grandeur that can have no place in the grandeur of epaminondas courage i abominate those mad exhortation of this other discomposed soul let u deprive wicked bloody and treacherous nature of such a pretence of reason let u set aside this guilty and extravagant justice and stick to more human imitation how great thing can time and example do in an encounter of the civil war against cinna one of pompey soldier have unawares kill hi brother who be of the contrary party he immediately for shame and sorrow kill himself and some year after in another civil war of the same people a soldier demand a reward of hi officer for have kill hi brother a man but ill prove the honour and beauty of an action by it utility and very erroneously conclude that every one be oblige to it and that it become every one to do it if it be of utility let u take that which be most necessary and profitable for human society it will be marriage and yet the council of the saint find the contrary much good exclude from it the most venerable vocation of man a we design those horse for stallion of which we have the least esteem other form man i only report him and represent a particular one ill fashion enough and whom if i have to model him anew i should certainly make something els than what he be but thats past recalling now though the feature of my picture alter and change ti not however unlike the world eternally turn round all thing therein be incessantly move the earth the rock of caucasus and the pyramid of egypt both by the public motion and their own even constancy itself be no other but a slow and more languishing motion i can not fix my object ti always totter and reel by a natural giddiness i take it a it be at the instant i consider it i do not paint it be i paint it passage not a passing from one age to another or a the people say from seven to seven year but from day to day from minute to minute i must accommodate my history to the hour i may presently change not only by fortune but also by intention ti a counterpart of various and changeable accident and of irresolute imagination and a it fall out sometimes contrary whether it be that i be then another self or that i take subject by other circumstance and consideration so it be that i may peradventure contradict myself but a demades say i never contradict the truth could my soul once take footing i would not essay but resolve but it be always learning and make trial i propose a life ordinary and without lustre ti all one all moral philosophy may as well be apply to a common and private life a to one of rich composition every man carry the entire form of human condition author communicate themselves to the people by some especial and extrinsic mark i the first of any by my universal be a michel de montaigne not a a grammarian a poet or a lawyer if the world find fault that i speak too much of myself i find fault that they do not so much a think of themselves but be it reason that be so particular in my way of living i should pretend to recommend myself to the public knowledge and be it also reason that i should produce to the world where art and handling have so much credit and authority crude and simple effect of nature and of a weak nature to boot be it not to build a wall without stone or brick or some such thing to write book without learn and without art the fancy of music be carry on by art mine by chance i have this at least accord to discipline that never any man treat of a subject he good understood and know than i what i have undertake and that in this i be the most understanding man alive secondly that never any man penetrate far into hi matter nor good and more distinctly sift the part and sequence of it nor ever more exactly and fully arrive at the end he propose to himself to perfect it i need bring nothing but fidelity to the work and that be there and the most pure and sincere that be anywhere to be find i speak truth not so much a i would but as much a i dare and i dare a little the more a i grow old for methinks custom allows to age more liberty of prate and more indiscretion of talk of a man self that can not fall out here which i often see elsewhere that the work and the artificer contradict one another can a man of such sober conversation have write so foolish a book or do so learn writing proceed from a man of so weak conversation he who talk at a very ordinary rate and write rare matter ti to say that hi capacity be borrow and not hi own a learned man be not learn in all thing but a sufficient man be sufficient throughout even to ignorance itself here my book and i go hand in hand together elsewhere men may commend or censure the work without reference to the workman here they can not who touch the one touch the other he who shall judge of it without know him will more wrong himself than me he who do know him give me all the satisfaction i desire i shall be happy beyond my desert if i can obtain only thus much from the public approbation a to make men of understand perceive that i be capable of profit by knowledge have i have it and that i deserve to have be assist by a good memory be please here to excuse what i often repeat that i very rarely repent and that my conscience be satisfy with itself not a the conscience of an angel or that of a horse but a the conscience of a man always add this clause not one of ceremony but a true and real submission that i speak inquire and doubt purely and simply refer myself to the common and accepted belief for the resolution i do not teach i only relate there be no vice that be absolutely a vice which do not offend and that a sound judgment do not accuse for there be in it so manifest a deformity and inconvenience that peradventure they be in the right who say that it be chiefly beget by stupidity and ignorance so hard be it to imagine that a man can know without abhor it malice suck up the great part of it own venom and poison itself vice leave repentance in the soul like an ulcer in the flesh which be always scratch and lacerate itself for reason effaces all other grief and sorrow but it beget that of repentance which be so much the more grievous by reason it spring within a the cold and heat of fever be more sharp than those that only strike upon the outward skin i hold for vice but every one accord to it proportion not only those which reason and nature condemn but those also which the opinion of men though false and erroneous have make such if authorise by law and custom there be likewise no virtue which do not rejoice a welldescended nature there be a kind of i know not what congratulation in welldoing that give u an inward satisfaction and a generous boldness that accompany a good conscience a soul daringly vicious may peradventure arm itself with security but it can not supply itself with this complacency and satisfaction ti no little satisfaction to feel a man self preserve from the contagion of so deprave an age and to say to himself whoever could penetrate into my soul would not there find me guilty either of the affliction or ruin of any one or of revenge or envy or any offence against the public law or of innovation or disturbance or failure of my word and though the licence of the time permit and teach every one so to do yet have i not plunder any frenchman good or take hi money and have live upon what be my own in war as well a in peace neither have i set any man to work without pay him hi hire these testimony of a good conscience please and this natural rejoicing be very beneficial to u and the only reward that we can never fail of to grind the recompense of virtuous action upon the approbation of other be too uncertain and unsafe a foundation especially in so corrupt and ignorant an age a this wherein the good opinion of the vulgar be injurious upon whom do you rely to show you what be recommend god defend me from be an honest man accord to the description of honour i daily see every one make of himself some of my friend have at time school and scold me with great sincerity and plainness either of their own voluntary motion or by me entreat to it a to an office which to a wellcomposed soul surpass not only in utility but in kindness all other office of friendship i have always receive them with the most open arm both of courtesy and acknowledgment but to say the truth i have often find so much false measure both in their reproach and praise that i have not do much amiss rather to have do ill than to have do well accord to their notion we who live private life not expose to any other view than our own ought chiefly to have settle a pattern within ourselves by which to try our action and accord to that sometimes to encourage and sometimes to correct ourselves i have my law and my judicature to judge of myself and apply myself more to these than to any other rule i do indeed restrain my action accord to other but extend them not by any other rule than my own you yourself only know if you be cowardly and cruel loyal and devout other see you not and only guess at you by uncertain conjecture and do not so much see your nature a your art rely not therefore upon their opinion but stick to your own but the say that repentance immediately follow the sin seem not to have respect to sin in it high estate which be lodge in u a in it own proper habitation one may disown and retract the vice that surprise u and to which we be hurry by passion but those which by a long habit be root in a strong and vigorous will be not subject to contradiction repentance be no other but a recanting of the will and an opposition to our fancy which lead u which way they please it make this person disown hi former virtue and continency ti an exact life that maintain itself in due order in private every one may juggle hi part and represent an honest man upon the stage but within and in hi own bosom where all may do a they list where all be conceal to be regular there the point the next degree be to be so in hi house and in hi ordinary action for which we be accountable to none and where there be no study nor artifice and therefore bias set forth the excellent state of a private family say of which a the master be the same within by hi own virtue and temper that he be abroad for fear of the law and report of men and it be a worthy saying of julius drusus to the mason who offer him for three thousand crown to put hi house in such a posture that hi neighbour should no longer have the same inspection into it a before i will give you say he six thousand to make it so that everybody may see into every room ti honourably record of agesilaus that he use in hi journey always to take up hi lodging in temple to the end that the people and the god themselves might pry into hi most private action such a one have be a miracle to the world in whom neither hi wife nor servant have ever see anything so much a remarkable few men have be admire by their own domestic no one be ever a prophet not merely in hi own house but in hi own country say the experience of history tis the same in thing of nought and in this low example the image of a great be to be see in my country of gascony they look upon it a a drollery to see me in print the further off i be read from my own home the good i be esteemed i purchase printer in guienne elsewhere they purchase me upon this it be that they lay their foundation who conceal themselves present and live to obtain a name when they be dead and absent i have rather have a great deal less in hand and do not expose myself to the world upon any other account than my present share when i leave it i quit the rest see this functionary whom the people escort in state with wonder and applause to hi very door he put off the pageant with hi robe and fall so much the low by how much he be higher exalt in himself within all be tumult and degraded and though all should be regular there it will require a vivid and wellchosen judgment to perceive it in these low and private action to which may be add that order be a dull sombre virtue to enter a breach conduct an embassy govern a people be action of renown to reprehend laugh sell pay love hate and gently and justly converse with a man own family and with himself not to relax not to give a man self the lie be more rare and hard and less remarkable by which mean retired life whatever be say to the contrary undergo duty of as great or great difficulty than the other do and private men say aristotle serve virtue more painfully and highly than those in authority do we prepare ourselves for eminent occasion more out of glory than conscience the short way to arrive at glory would be to do that for conscience which we do for glory and the virtue of alexander appear to me of much less vigour in hi great theatre than that of socrates in hi mean and obscure employment i can easily conceive socrates in the place of alexander but alexander in that of socrates i can not who shall ask the one what he can do he will answer subdue the world and who shall put the same question to the other he will say carry on human life conformably with it natural condition a much more general weighty and legitimate science than the other the virtue of the soul do not consist in fly high but in walk orderly it grandeur do not exercise itself in grandeur but in mediocrity a they who judge and try u within make no great account of the lustre of our public action and see they be only streaks and ray of clear water spring from a slimy and muddy bottom so likewise they who judge of u by this gallant outward appearance in like manner conclude of our internal constitution and can not couple common faculty and like their own with the other faculty that astonish them and be so far out of their sight therefore it be that we give such savage form to demon and who do not give tamerlane great eyebrow wide nostril a dreadful visage and a prodigious stature accord to the imagination he have conceive by the report of hi name have any one formerly bring me to erasmus i should hardly have believe but that all be adage and apothegm he speak to hi man or hi hostess we much more aptly imagine an artisan upon hi closestool or upon hi wife than a great president venerable by hi port and sufficiency we fancy that they from their high tribunal will not abase themselves so much a to live a vicious soul be often incite by some foreign impulse to do well so be virtuous soul to do ill they be therefore to be judge by their settle state when they be at home whenever that may be and at all event when they be near repose and in their native station natural inclination be much assist and fortify by education but they seldom alter and overcome their institution a thousand nature of my time have escape towards virtue or vice through a quite contrary discipline these original quality be not to be root out they may be cover and conceal the latin tongue be a it be natural to me i understand it good than french but i have not be use to speak it nor hardly to write it these forty year unless upon extreme and sudden emotion which i have fall into twice or thrice in my life and once see my father in perfect health fall upon me in a swoon i have always utter from the bottom of my heart my first word in latin nature deafen and forcibly express itself in spite of so long a discontinuation and this example be say of many other they who in my time have attempt to correct the manner of the world by new opinion reform seem vice but the essential vice they leave a they be if indeed they do not augment them and augmentation be therein to be fear we defer all other well do upon the account of these external reformation of less cost and great show and thereby expiate good cheap for the other natural consubstantial and intestine vice look a little into our experience there be no man if he listen to himself who do not in himself discover a particular and govern form of hi own that jostle hi education and wrestle with the tempest of passion that be contrary to it for my part i seldom find myself agitate with surprise i always find myself in my place a heavy and unwieldy body do if i be not at home i be always near at hand my dissipation do not transport me very far there be nothing strange or extreme in the case and yet i have sound and vigorous turn the true condemnation and which touch the common practice of men be that their very retirement itself be full of filth and corruption the idea of their reformation compose their repentance sick and faulty very nearly as much a their sin some either from have be link to vice by a natural propension or long practice can not see it deformity other of which constitution i be do indeed feel the weight of vice but they counterbalance it with pleasure or some other occasion and suffer and lend themselves to it for a certain price but viciously and basely yet there might haply be imagine so vast a disproportion of measure where with justice the pleasure might excuse the sin a we say of utility not only if accidental and out of sin a in theft but in the very exercise of sin or in the enjoyment of woman where the temptation be violent and ti say sometimes not to be overcome being the other day at armaignac on the estate of a kinsman of mine i there saw a peasant who be by every one nickname the thief he thus relate the story of hi life that be bear a beggar and finding that he should not be able so a to be clear of indigence to get hi living by the sweat of hi brow he resolve to turn thief and by mean of hi strength of body have exercise this trade all the time of hi youth in great security for he ever make hi harvest and vintage in other men ground but a great way off and in so great quantity that it be not to be imagine one man could have carry away so much in one night upon hi shoulder and moreover he be careful equally to divide and distribute the mischief he do that the loss be of less importance to every particular man he be now grown old and rich for a man of hi condition thanks to hi trade which he openly confess to every one and to make hi peace with god he say that he be daily ready by good office to make satisfaction to the successor of those he have rob and if he do not finish for to do it all at once he be not able he will then leave it in charge to hi heir to perform the rest proportion to the wrong he himself only know he have do to each by this description true or false this man look upon theft a a dishonest action and hat it but less than poverty and simply repents but to the extent he have thus recompense he repent not this be not that habit which incorporate u into vice and conforms even our understand itself to it nor be it that impetuous whirlwind that by gust trouble and blind our soul and for the time precipitate u judgment and all into the power of vice i customarily do what i do thoroughly and make but one step ont i have rarely any movement that hide itself and steal away from my reason and that do not proceed in the matter by the consent of all my faculty without division or intestine sedition my judgment be to have all the blame or all the praise and the blame it once have it have always for almost from my infancy it have ever be one the same inclination the same turn the same force and a to universal opinion i fix myself from my childhood in the place where i resolve to stick there be some sin that be impetuous prompt and sudden let u set them aside but in these other sin so often repeat deliberate and contrive whether sin of complexion or sin of profession and vocation i can not conceive that they should have so long be settle in the same resolution unless the reason and conscience of him who have them be constant to have them and the repentance he boast to be inspire with on a sudden be very hard for me to imagine or form i follow not the opinion of the pythagorean sect that men take up a new soul when they repair to the image of the god to receive their oracle unless he mean that it must needs be extrinsic new and lent for the time our own showing so little sign of purification and cleanness fit for such an office they act quite contrary to the stoical precept who do indeed command u to correct the imperfection and vice we know ourselves guilty of but forbid u therefore to disturb the repose of our souls these make u believe that they have great grief and remorse within but of amendment correction or interruption they make nothing appear it can not be a cure if the malady be not wholly discharge if repentance be lay upon the scale of the balance it would weigh down sin i find no quality so easy to counterfeit a devotion if men do not conform their manner and life to the profession it essence be abstruse and occult the appearance easy and ostentatious for my own part i may desire in general to be other than i be i may condemn and dislike my whole form and beg of almighty god for an entire reformation and that he will please to pardon my natural infirmity but i ought not to call this repentance methinks no more than the be dissatisfy that i be not an angel or cato my action be regular and conformable to what i be and to my condition i can do no good and repentance do not properly touch thing that be not in our power sorrow do i imagine an infinite number of nature more elevated and regular than mine and yet i do not for all that improve my faculty no more than my arm or will grow more strong and vigorous for conceive those of another to be so if to conceive and wish a noble way of act than that we have should produce a repentance of our own we must then repent u of our most innocent action forasmuch a we may well suppose that in a more excellent nature they would have be carry on with great dignity and perfection and we would that ours be so when i reflect upon the deportment of my youth with that of my old age i find that i have commonly behave myself with equal order in both accord to what i understand this be all that my resistance can do i do not flatter myself in the same circumstance i should do the same thing it be not a patch but rather an universal tincture with which i be stain i know no repentance superficial halfway and ceremonious it must sting me all over before i can call it so and must prick my bowel a deeply and universally a god see into me a to business many excellent opportunity have escape me for want of good management and yet my deliberation be sound enough accord to the occurrence present to me tis their way to choose always the easy and safe course i find that in my former resolve i have proceed with discretion accord to my own rule and accord to the state of the subject propose and should do the same a thousand year hence in like occasion i do not consider what it be now but what it be then when i deliberate on it the force of all counsel consist in the time occasion and thing eternally shift and change i have in my life commit some important error not for want of good understanding but for want of good luck there be secret and not to be foreseen part in matter we have in hand especially in the nature of men mute condition that make no show unknown sometimes even to the possessor themselves that spring and start up by incidental occasion if my prudence could not penetrate into nor foresee them i blame it not tis commission no further than it own limit if the event be too hard for me and take the side i have refuse there be no remedy i do not blame myself i accuse my fortune and not my work this can not be call repentance phocion have give the athenian an advice that be not follow and the affair nevertheless succeed contrary to hi opinion some one say to him well phocion art thou content that matter go so well i be very well content reply he that this have happen so well but i do not repent that i counsel the other when any of my friend address themselves to me for advice i give it candidly and clearly without stick a almost all other men do at the hazard of the thing fall out contrary to my opinion and that i may be reproach for my counsel i be very indifferent a to that for the fault will be theirs for have consult me and i could not refuse them that office i for my own part can rarely blame any one but myself for my oversight and misfortune for indeed i seldom solicit the advice of another if not by honour of ceremony or except where i stand in need of information special science or a to matter of fact but in thing wherein i stand in need of nothing but judgment other men reason may serve to fortify my own but have little power to dissuade me i hear them all with civility and patience but to my recollection i never make use of any but my own with me they be but fly and atom that confound and distract my will i lay no great stress upon my opinion but i lay as little upon those of other and fortune reward me accordingly if i receive but little advice i also give but little i be seldom consult and still more seldom believe and know no concern either public or private that have be mend or better by my advice even they whom fortune have in some sort tie to my direction have more willingly suffer themselves to be govern by any other counsel than mine and a a man who be a jealous of my repose a of my authority i be well pleased that it should be so in leave me there they humour what i profess which be to settle and wholly contain myself within myself i take a pleasure in be uninterested in other men affair and disengage from be their warranty and responsible for what they do in all affair that be past be it how it will i have very little regret for this imagination put me out of my pain that they be so to fall out they be in the great revolution of the world and in the chain of stoical cause your fancy can not by wish and imagination move one tittle but that the great current of thing will not reverse both the past and the future a to the rest i abominate that incidental repentance which old age bring along with it he who say of old that he be oblige to hi age for have wean him from pleasure be of another opinion than i be i can never think myself beholden to impotency for any good it can do to me our appetite be rare in old age a profound satiety seize u after the act in this i see nothing of conscience chagrin and weakness imprint in u a drowsy and rheumatic virtue we must not suffer ourselves to be so wholly carry away by natural alteration a to suffer our judgment to be impose upon by them youth and pleasure have not formerly so far prevail with me that i do not well enough discern the face of vice in pleasure neither do the distaste that year have bring me so far prevail with me now that i can not discern pleasure in vice now that i be no more in my flourishing age i judge as well of these thing a if i be i who narrowly and strictly examine it find my reason the very same it be in my most licentious age except perhaps that ti weak and more decayed by be grow old and i find that the pleasure it refuse me upon the account of my bodily health it would no more refuse now in consideration of the health of my soul than at any time heretofore i do not repute it the more valiant for not be able to combat my temptation be so broken and mortify that they be not worth it opposition hold but out my hand i repel them should one present the old concupiscence before it i fear it would have less power to resist it than heretofore i do not discern that in itself it judge anything otherwise now than it formerly do nor that it have acquire any new light wherefore if there be convalescence ti an enchanted one miserable kind of remedy to owe one health to one disease ti not that our misfortune should perform this office but the good fortune of our judgment i be not to be make to do anything by persecution and affliction but to curse them that be for people who can not be rouse but by a whip my reason be much more free in prosperity and much more distracted and put tot to digest pain than pleasure i see best in a clear sky health admonishes me more cheerfully and to good purpose than sickness i do all that in me lay to reform and regulate myself from pleasure at a time when i have health and vigour to enjoy them i should be ashamed and envious that the misery and misfortune of my old age should have credit over my good healthful sprightly and vigorous year and that men should estimate me not by what i have be but by what i have cease to be in my opinion ti the happy living and not a antisthenes say the happy dying in which human felicity consist i have not make it my business to make a monstrous addition of a philosopher tail to the head and body of a libertine nor would i have this wretched remainder give the lie to the pleasant sound and long part of my life i would present myself uniformly throughout were i to live my life over again i should live it just a i have live it i neither complain of the past nor do i fear the future and if i be not much deceive i be the same within that i be without ti one main obligation i have to my fortune that the succession of my bodily estate have be carry on accord to the natural season i have see the grass the blossom and the fruit and now see the wither happily however because naturally i bear the infirmity i have the good because they come not till i have reason to expect them and because also they make me with great pleasure remember that long felicity of my past life my wisdom may have be just the same in both age but it be more active and of good grace whilst young and sprightly than now it be when broken peevish and uneasy i repudiate then these casual and painful reformation god must touch our heart our conscience must amend of themselves by the aid of our reason and not by the decay of our appetite pleasure be in itself neither pale nor discolour to be discern by dim and decayed eye we ought to love temperance for itself and because god have command that and chastity but that which we be reduce to by catarrh and for which i be indebted to the stone be neither chastity nor temperance a man can not boast that he despise and resist pleasure if he can not see it if he know not what it be and can not discern it grace it force and most alluring beauty i know both the one and the other and may therefore the good say it but methinks our soul in old age be subject to more troublesome malady and imperfection than in youth i say the same when young and when i be reproach with the want of a beard and i say so now that my grey hair give me some authority we call the difficulty of our humour and the disrelish of present thing wisdom but in truth we do not so much forsake vice a we change them and in my opinion for bad besides a foolish and feeble pride an impertinent prate froward and insociable humour superstition and a ridiculous desire of rich when we have lose the use of them i find there more envy injustice and malice age imprint more wrinkle in the mind than it do on the face and soul be never or very rarely see that in grow old do not smell sour and musty man move all together both towards hi perfection and decay in observe the wisdom of socrates and many circumstance of hi condemnation i should dare to believe that he in some sort himself purposely by collusion contribute to it see that at the age of seventy year he might fear to suffer the lofty motion of hi mind to be cramp and hi wonted lustre obscure what strange metamorphosis do i see age every day make in many of my acquaintance ti a potent malady and that naturally and imperceptibly steal into u a vast provision of study and great precaution be require to evade the imperfection it load u with or at least to weaken their progress i find that notwithstanding all my entrenchment it get foot by foot upon me i make the best resistance i can but i do not know to what at last it will reduce me but fall out what will i be content the world may know when i be fall from what i fell we must not rivet ourselves so fast to our humour and complexion our chiefest sufficiency be to know how to apply ourselves to diver employment tis to be but not to live to keep a man self tie and bind by necessity to one only course those be the brave soul that have in them the most variety and pliancy of this here be an honourable testimony of the elder cato had i liberty to set myself forth after my own mode there be no so graceful fashion to which i would be so fix a not to be able to disengage myself from it life be an unequal irregular and multiform motion ti not to be a friend to one self much less a master ti to be a slave incessantly to be lead by the nose by one self and to be so fix in one previous inclination that one can not turn aside nor writhe one neck out of the collar i say this now in this part of my life wherein i find i can not easily disengage myself from the importunity of my soul which can not ordinarily amuse itself but in thing of limited range nor employ itself otherwise than entirely and with all it force upon the light subject offer it expand and stretch it to that degree a therein to employ it utmost power wherefore it be that idleness be to me a very painful labour and very prejudicial to my health most men mind require foreign matter to exercise and enliven them mine have rather need of it to sit still and repose itself for it chiefest and hardest study be to study itself book be to it a sort of employment that debauch it from it study upon the first thought that possess it it begin to bustle and make trial of it vigour in all direction exercise it power of handle now make trial of force now fortify moderating and range itself by the way of grace and order it have of it own wherewith to rouse it faculty nature have give to it a to all other matter enough of it own to make advantage of and subject proper enough where it may either invent or judge meditation be a powerful and full study to such a can effectually taste and employ themselves i have rather fashion my soul than furnish it there be no employment either more weak or more strong than that of entertain a man own thought accord a the soul be the great men make it their whole business nature have therefore favour it with this privilege that there be nothing we can do so long nor any action to which we more frequently and with great facility addict ourselves ti the business of the god say aristotle and from which both their beatitude and ours proceed the principal use of reading to me be that by various object it rouse my reason and employ my judgment not my memory few conversation detain me without force and effort it be true that beauty and elegance of speech take a much or more with me than the weight and depth of the subject and forasmuch a i be apt to be sleepy in all other communication and give but the rind of my attention it often fall out that in such poor and pitiful discourse mere chatter i either make drowsy unmeaning answer unbecoming a child and ridiculous or more foolishly and rudely still maintain an obstinate silence i have a pensive way that withdraw me into myself and with that a heavy and childish ignorance of many very ordinary thing by which two quality i have earn this that men may truly relate five or six a ridiculous tale of me a of any other man whatever but to proceed in my subject this difficult complexion of mine render me very nice in my conversation with men whom i must cull and pick out for my purpose and unfits me for common society we live and negotiate with the people if their conversation be troublesome to u if we disdain to apply ourselves to mean and vulgar soul and the mean and vulgar be often as regular a those of the fine thread and all wisdom be folly that do not accommodate itself to the common ignorance we must no more intermeddle either with other men affair or our own for business both public and private have to do with these people the least forced and most natural motion of the soul be the most beautiful the best employment those that be least strained my god how good an office do wisdom to those whose desire it limit to their power that be the most useful knowledge accord to what a man can be the favourite sentence and motto of socrates a motto of great solidity we must moderate and adapt our desire to the near and easy to be acquire thing be it not a foolish humour of mine to separate myself from a thousand to whom my fortune have conjoin me and without whom i can not live and cleave to one or two who be out of my intercourse or rather a fantastic desire of a thing i can not obtain my gentle and easy manner enemy of all sourness and harshness may easily enough have secure me from envy and animosity to be beloved i do not say but never any man give less occasion of be hat but the coldness of my conversation have reasonably enough deprive me of the goodwill of many who be to be excuse if they interpret it in another and bad sense i be very capable of contract and maintain rare and exquisite friendship for by reason that i so greedily seize upon such acquaintance a fit my liking i throw myself with such violence upon them that i hardly fail to stick and to make an impression where i hit a i have often make happy proof in ordinary friendship i be somewhat cold and shy for my motion be not natural if not with full sail besides which my fortune have in my youth give me a relish for one sole and perfect friendship have in truth create in me a kind of distaste to other and too much imprint in my fancy that it be a beast of company a the ancient say but not of the herd and also i have a natural difficulty of communicate myself by half with the modification and the servile and jealous prudence require in the conversation of numerous and imperfect friendship and we be principally enjoin to these in this age of ours when we can not talk of the world but either with danger or falsehood yet do i very well discern that he who have the convenience i mean the essential convenience of life for hi end a i have ought to fly these difficulty and delicacy of humour as much a the plague i should commend a soul of several stage that know both how to stretch and to slacken itself that find itself at ease in all condition whither fortune lead it that can discourse with a neighbour of hi build hi hunt hi quarrel that can chat with a carpenter or a gardener with pleasure i envy those who can render themselves familiar with the mean of their follower and talk with them in their own way and dislike the advice of plato that men should always speak in a magisterial tone to their servant whether men or woman without be sometimes facetious and familiar for besides the reason i have give ti inhuman and unjust to set so great a value upon this pitiful prerogative of fortune and the polity wherein less disparity be permit betwixt master and servant seem to me the most equitable other study how to raise and elevate their mind i how to humble mine and to bring it low tis only vicious in extension thus a the lacedaemonian valour stand in need of moderation and of the sweet and harmonious sound of flute to soften it in battle l they should precipitate themselves into temerity and fury whereas all other nation commonly make use of harsh and shrill sound and of loud and imperious cry to incite and heat the soldier courage to the last degree so methinks contrary to the usual method in the practice of our mind we have for the most part more need of lead than of wing of temperance and composed than of ardour and agitation but above all thing ti in my opinion egregiously to play the fool to put on the grave air of a man of lofty mind amongst those who be nothing of the sort ever to speak in print by the book you must let yourself down to those with whom you converse and sometimes affect ignorance lay aside power and subtilty in common conversation to preserve decorum and order ti enoughnay crawl on the earth if they so desire it the learned often stumble at this stone they will always be parade their pedantic science and strew their book everywhere they have in these day so fill the cabinet and ear of the lady with them that if they have lose the substance they at least retain the word so a in all discourse upon all sort of subject how mean and common soever they speak and write after a new and learned way and quote plato and aquinas in thing the first man they meet could determine as well the learning that can not penetrate their soul hang still upon the tongue if people of quality will be persuade by me they shall content themselves with set out their proper and natural treasure they conceal and cover their beauty under other that be none of theirs ti a great folly to put out their own light and shine by a borrow lustre they be interred and buried under de capsula totae it be because they do not sufficiently know themselves or do themselves justice the world have nothing fairer than they tis for them to honour the art and to paint paint what need have they of anything but to live beloved and honour they have and know but too much for this they need do no more but rouse and heat a little the faculty they have of their own when i see them tamper with rhetoric law logic and other drug so improper and unnecessary for their business i begin to suspect that the men who inspire them with such fancy do it that they may govern them upon that account for what other excuse can i contrive it be enough that they can without our instruction compose the grace of their eye to gaiety severity sweetness and season a denial with asperity suspense or favour they need not another to interpret what we speak for their service with this knowledge they command with a switch and rule both the tutor and the school but if nevertheless it anger them to give place to u in anything whatever and will out of curiosity have their share in book poetry be a diversion proper for them tis a wanton subtle dissembling and prate art all pleasure and all show like themselves they may also abstract several commodity from history in philosophy out of the moral part of it they may select such instruction a will teach them to judge of our humour and condition to defend themselves from our treachery to regulate the ardour of their own desire to manage their liberty to lengthen the pleasure of life and gently to bear the inconstancy of a lover the rudeness of a husband and the importunity of year wrinkle and the like this be the utmost of what i would allow them in the science there be some particular nature that be private and retire my natural way be proper for communication and apt to lay me open i be all without and in sight born for society and friendship the solitude that i love myself and recommend to other be chiefly no other than to withdraw my thought and affection into myself to restrain and check not my step but my own care and desire resign all foreign solicitude and mortally avoid servitude and obligation and not so much the crowd of men a the crowd of business local solitude to say the truth rather give me more room and set me more at large i more readily throw myself upon affair of state and the world when i be alone at the louvre and in the bustle of the court i fold myself within my own skin the crowd thrust me upon myself and i never entertain myself so wantonly with so much licence or so especially a in place of respect and ceremonious prudence our folly do not make me laugh it be our wisdom which do i be naturally no enemy to a court life i have therein pass a part of my own and be of a humour cheerfully to frequent great company provide it be by interval and at my own time but this softness of judgment whereof i speak tie me perforce to solitude even at home amidst a numerous family and in a house sufficiently frequent i see people enough but rarely such with whom i delight to converse and i there reserve both for myself and other an unusual liberty there be in my house no such thing a ceremony ushering or wait upon people down to the coach and such other troublesome ceremony a our courtesy enjoin o the servile and importunate custom every one there govern himself accord to hi own method let who will speak hi thought i sit mute meditating and shut up in my closet without any offence to my guest the men whose society and familiarity i covet be those they call sincere and able men and the image of these make me disrelish the rest it be if rightly take the rarest of our form and a form that we chiefly owe to nature the end of this commerce be simply privacy frequent and conference the exercise of soul without other fruit in our discourse all subject be alike to me let there be neither weight nor depth ti all one there be yet grace and pertinency all there be tint with a mature and constant judgment and mixed with goodness freedom gaiety and friendship ti not only in talk of the affair of king and state that our wit discover their force and beauty but every whit as much in private conference i understand my men even by their silence and smile and good discover them perhaps at table than in the council hippomachus say very well that he could know the good wrestler by only see them walk in the street if learning please to step into our talk it shall not be reject not magisterial imperious and importunate asit commonly be but suffragan and docile itself we there only seek to pass away our time when we have a mind to be instruct and preach to we will go seek this in it throne please let it humble itself to u for the nonce for useful and profitable a it be i imagine that at need we may manage well enough without it and do our business without it assistance a welldescended soul and practise in the conversation of men will of herself render herself sufficiently agreeable art be nothing but the counterpart and register of what such souls produce the conversation also of beautiful and honourable woman be for me a sweet commerce if the soul have not therein so much to enjoy a in the first the bodily sense which participate more of this bring it to a proportion next to though in my opinion not equal to the other but tis a commerce wherein a man must stand a little upon hi guard especially those where the body can do much a in me i there scald myself in my youth and suffer all the torment that poet say befall those who precipitate themselves into love without order and judgment it be true that that whipping have make me wise since ti folly to fix all a man thought upon it and to engage in it with a furious and indiscreet affection but on the other hand to engage there without love and without inclination like comedian to play a common part without put anything to it of hi own but word be indeed to provide for hi safety but withal after a cowardly a manner a he who should abandon hi honour profit or pleasure for fear of danger for it be certain that from such a practice they who set it on foot can expect no fruit that can please or satisfy a noble soul a man must have in good earnest desire that which he in good earnest expect to have a pleasure in enjoy i say though fortune should unjustly favour their dissimulation which often fall out because there be none of the sex let her be as ugly a the devil who do not think herself well worthy to be beloved and who do not prefer herself before other woman either for her youth the colour of her hair or her graceful motion for there be no more woman universally ugly than there be woman universally beautiful and such of the brahmin virgin a have nothing els to recommend them the people be assemble by the common crier to that effect come out into the marketplace to expose their matrimonial part to public view to try if these at least be not of temptation sufficient to get them a husband consequently there be not one who do not easily suffer herself to be overcome by the first vow that they make to serve her now from this common and ordinary treachery of the men of the present day that must fall out which we already experimentally see either that they rally together and separate themselves by themselves to evade u or els form their discipline by the example we give them play their part of the farce a we do ours and give themselves up to the sport without passion care or love believe accord to the persuasion of lysias in plato that they may with more utility and convenience surrender themselves up to u the less we love them where it will fall out a in comedy that the people will have as much pleasure or more than the comedian for my part i no more acknowledge a venus without a cupid than a mother without issue they be thing that mutully lend and owe their essence to one another thus this cheat recoil upon him who be guilty of it it do not cost him much indeed but he also get little or nothing by it they who have make venus a goddess have take notice that her principal beauty be incorporeal and spiritual but the venus whom these people hunt after be not so much a human nor indeed brutal the very beast will not accept it so gross and so earthly we see that imagination and desire often heat and incite them before the body do we see in both the one sex and the other they have in the herd choice and particular election in their affection and that they have amongst themselves a long commerce of good will even those to whom old age deny the practice of their desire still tremble neigh and twitter for love we see them before the act full of hope and ardour and when the body have play it game yet please themselves with the sweet remembrance of the past delight some that swell with pride after they have perform and other who tire and sate still by vociferation express a triumphing joy he who have nothing to do but only to discharge hi body of a natural necessity need not trouble other with so curious preparation it be not meat for a gross coarse appetite a one who do not desire that men should think me good than i be i will here say this a to the error of my youth not only from the danger of impair my health and yet i could not be so careful but that i have two light mischance but moreover upon the account of contempt i have seldom give myself up to common and mercenary embrace i would heighten the pleasure by the difficulty by desire and a certain kind of glory and be of tiberius mind who in hi amour be as much take with modesty and birth a any other quality and of the courtesan flora humour who never lend herself to less than a dictator a consul or a censor and take pleasure in the dignity of her lover doubtless pearl and gold tissue title and train add something to it a to the rest i have a great esteem for wit provide the person be not exceptionable for to confess the truth if the one or the other of these two attraction must of necessity be want i should rather have quit that of the understanding that have it use in good thing but in the subject of love a subject principally relate to the sens of see and touch something may be do without the grace of the mind without the grace of the body nothing beauty be the true prerogative of woman and so peculiarly their own that ours though naturally require another sort of feature be never in it lustre but when youthful and beardless a sort of confused image of theirs ti say that such a serve the grand signior upon the account of beauty who be an infinite number be at the late dismiss at twoandtwenty year of age reason prudence and the office of friendship be good find amongst men and therefore it be that they govern the affair of the world these two engagement be fortuitous and depend upon other the one be troublesome by it rarity the other withers with age so that they could never have be sufficient for the business of my life that of book which be the third be much more certain and much more our own it yield all other advantage to the two first but have the constancy and facility of it service for it own share it go side by side with me in my whole course and everywhere be assist me it comfort me in old age and solitude it ease me of a troublesome weight of idleness and delivers me at all hour from company that i dislike it blunt the point of grief if they be not extreme and have not get an entire possession of my soul to divert myself from a troublesome fancy ti but to run to my book they presently fix me to them and drive the other out of my thought and do not mutiny at see that i have only recourse to them for want of other more real natural and lively commodity they always receive me with the same kindness he may well go a foot they say who lead hi horse in hi hand and our james king of naples and sicily who handsome young and healthful cause himself to be carry about on a barrow extend upon a pitiful mattress in a poor robe of grey cloth and a cap of the same yet attend withal by a royal train litter lead horse of all sort gentleman and officer do yet herein represent a tender and unsteady authority the sick man have not to complain who have hi cure in hi sleeve in the experience and practice of this maxim which be a very true one consist all the benefit i reap from book a a matter of fact i make no more use of them a it be than those who know them not i enjoy them a miser do their money in know that i may enjoy them when i please my mind be satisfy with this right of possession i never travel without book either in peace or war and yet sometimes i pass over several day and sometimes month without look on them i will read byandby say i to myself or tomorrow or when i please and in the interim time steal away without any inconvenience for it be not to be imagine to what degree i please myself and rest content in this consideration that i have them by me to divert myself with them when i be so disposed and to call to mind what a refreshment they be to my life ti the best viaticum i have yet find out for this human journey and i very much pity those men of understanding who be unprovided of it i the rather accept of any other sort of diversion how light soever because this can never fail me when at home i a little more frequent my library whence i overlook at once all the concern of my family ti situate at the entrance into my house and i thence see under me my garden court and basecourt and almost all part of the building there i turn over now one book and then another on various subject without method or design one while i meditate another i record and dictate a i walk to and fro such whimsy a these i present to you here tis in the third storey of a tower of which the groundroom be my chapel the second storey a chamber with a withdrawingroom and closet where i often lie to be more retired and above be a great wardrobe this formerly be the most useless part of the house i there pass away both most of the day of my life and most of the hour of those day in the night i be never there there be by the side of it a cabinet handsome enough with a fireplace very commodiously contrive and plenty of light and be i not more afraid of the trouble than the expense the trouble that fright me from all business i could very easily adjoin on either side and on the same floor a gallery of an hundred pace long and twelve broad have find wall already raise for some other design to the requisite height every place of retirement require a walk my thought sleep if i sit still my fancy do not go by itself a when my leg move it and all those who study without a book be in the same condition the figure of my study be round and there be no more open wall than what be take up by my table and my chair so that the remain part of the circle present me a view of all my book at once range upon five row of shelf round about me it have three noble and free prospect and be sixteen pace in diameter i be not so continually there in winter for my house be build upon an eminence a it name import and no part of it be so much expose to the wind and weather a this which please me the good a be of more difficult access and a little remote a well upon the account of exercise a also be there more retired from the crowd ti there that i be in my kingdom and there i endeavour to make myself an absolute monarch and to sequester this one corner from all society conjugal filial and civil elsewhere i have but verbal authority only and of a confused essence that man in my opinion be very miserable who have not at home where to be by himself where to entertain himself alone or to conceal himself from other ambition sufficiently plague her proselyte by keep them always in show like the statue of a public square they can not so much a be private in the watercloset i have think nothing so severe in the austerity of life that our monk affect a what i have observe in some of their community namely by rule to have a perpetual society of place and numerous person present in every action whatever and think it much more supportable to be always alone than never to be so if any one shall tell me that it be to undervalue the mus to make use of them only for sport and to pass away the time i shall tell him that he do not know so well a i the value of the sport the pleasure and the pastime i can hardly forbear to add that all other end be ridiculous i live from day to day and with reverence be it speak i only live for myself there all my design terminate i study when young for ostentation since to make myself a little wiser and now for my diversion but never for any profit a vain and prodigal humour i have after this sort of furniture not only for the supply my own need but moreover for ornament and outward show i have since quite cure myself of book have many charm quality to such a know how to choose them but every good have it ill tis a pleasure that be not pure and clean no more than other it have it inconvenience and great one too the soul indeed be exercise therein but the body the care of which i must withal never neglect remain in the meantime without action and grow heavy and sombre i know no excess more prejudicial to me nor more to be avoid in this my decline age these have be my three favourite and particular occupation i speak not of those i owe to the world by civil obligation i be once employ in console a lady truly afflict most of their mourning be artificial and ceremonious a man go the wrong way to work when he oppose this passion for opposition do but irritate and make them more obstinate in sorrow the evil be exasperate by discussion we see in common discourse that what i have indifferently let fall from me if any one take it up to controvert it i justify it with the best argument i have and much more a thing wherein i have a real interest and besides in so do you enter roughly upon your operation whereas the first address of a physician to hi patient should be gracious gay and please never do any illlooking morose physician do anything to purpose on the contrary then a man should at the first approach favour their grief and express some approbation of their sorrow by this intelligence you obtain credit to proceed far and by a facile and insensible gradation fall into discourse more solid and proper for their cure i whose aim it be principally to gull the company who have their eye fix upon me take it into my head only to palliate the disease and indeed i have find by experience that i have an unlucky hand in persuade my argument be either too sharp and dry or press too roughly or not home enough after i have some time apply myself to her grief i do not attempt to cure her by strong and lively reason either because i have them not at hand or because i think to do my business well another way neither do i make choice of any of those method of consolation which philosophy prescribe that what we complain of be no evil accord to cleanthes that it be a light evil accord to the peripatetic that to bemoan one self be an action neither commendable nor just accord to chrysippus nor this of epicurus more suitable to my way of shift the thought from afflict thing to those that be please nor make a bundle of all these together to make use of upon occasion accord to cicero but gently bend my discourse and by little and little digress sometimes to subject nearer and sometimes more remote from the purpose accord a she be more intent on what i say i imperceptibly lead her from that sorrowful thought and keep her calm and in goodhumour whilst i continue there i herein make use of diversion they who succeed me in the same service do not for all that find any amendment in her for i have not go to the root i peradventure may elsewhere have glance upon some sort of public diversion and the practice of military one which pericles make use of in the peloponnesian war and a thousand other in other place to withdraw the adverse force from their own country be too frequent in history it be an ingenious evasion whereby monseigneur dhempricourt save both himself and other in the city of liege into which the duke of burgundy who keep it besiege have make him enter to execute the article of their promise surrender the people be assemble by night to consider of it begin to mutiny against the agreement and several of them resolve to fall upon the commissioner whom they have in their power he feel the gust of this first popular storm who be come to rush into hi lodging suddenly send out to them two of the inhabitant of the city of whom he have some with him with new and milder term to be propose in their council which he have then and there contrive for hi need these two divert the first tempest carry back the enraged rabble to the townhall to hear and consider of what they have to say the deliberation be short a second storm arise as violent a the other whereupon he despatch four new mediator of the same quality to meet them protest that he have now good condition to present them with and such a would give them absolute satisfaction by which mean the tumult be once more appeased and the people again turn back to the conclave in fine by this dispensation of amusement one after another divert their fury and dissipate it in frivolous consultation he lay it at last asleep till the day appear which be hi principal end this other story that follow be also of the same category atalanta a virgin of excel beauty and of wonderful disposition of body to disengage herself from the crowd of a thousand suitor who seek her in marriage make this proposition that she would accept of him for her husband who should equal her in run upon condition that they who fail should lose their life there be enough who think the prize very well worth the hazard and who suffer the cruel penalty of the contract hippomenes about to make trial after the rest make hi address to the goddess of love implore her assistance and she grant hi request give him three golden apple and instruct him how to use them the race beginning a hippomenes perceive hi mistress to press hard up to him he a it be by chance let fall one of these apple the maid take with the beauty of it fail not to step out of her way to pick it up he do the same when he saw hi time by the second and the third till by so divert her and make her lose so much ground he win the race when physician can not stop a catarrh they divert and turn it into some other less dangerous part and i find also that this be the most ordinary practice for the disease of the mind ti to little effect directly to jostle a mans infirmity we neither make him sustain nor repel the attack we only make him decline and evade it this other lesson be too high and too difficult ti for men of the first form of knowledge purely to insist upon the thing to consider and judge it it appertain to one sole socrates to meet death with an ordinary countenance to grow acquaint with it and to sport with it he seek no consolation out of the thing itself die appear to him a natural and indifferent accident ti there that he fix hi sight and resolution without look elsewhere the disciple of hegesias who starve themselves to death animate thereunto by hi fine lecture and in such number that king ptolemy order he should be forbid to entertain hi follower with such homicidal doctrine do not consider death in itself neither do they judge of it it be not there they fix their thought they run towards and aim at a new be the poor wretch whom we see brought upon the scaffold full of ardent devotion and therein as much a in them lie employ all their sens their ear in hear the instruction give them their eye and hand lift up towards heaven their voice in loud prayer with a vehement and continual emotion do doubtless thing very commendable and proper for such a necessity we ought to commend them for their devotion but not properly for their constancy they shun the encounter they divert their thought from the consideration of death a child be amuse with some toy or other when the surgeon be go to give them a prick with hi lancet i have see some who cast their eye upon the dreadful instrument of death round about have faint and furiously turn their thought another way such a be to pass a formidable precipice be advise either to shut their eye or to look another way subrius flavius be by nero command to be put to death and by the hand of niger both of them great captain when they lead him to the place appoint for hi execution see the grave that niger have cause to be

he and he very well foresee what would follow when he say so for niger arm so tremble that he have several blow at hi head before he could cut it off this man seem to have have hi thought rightly fix upon the subject he who die in a battle with hi sword in hi hand do not then think of death he feel or considers it not the ardour of the fight divert hi thought another way a worthy man of my acquaintance fall a he be fight a duel and feel himself nail to the earth by nine or ten thrust of hi enemy every one present call to him to think of hi conscience but he have since tell me that though he very well hear what they say it nothing move him and that he never think of anything but how to disengage and revenge himself he afterwards kill hi man in that very duel he who bring to l silanus the sentence of death do him a very great kindness in that have receive hi answer that he be well prepared to die but not by base hand he run upon him with hi soldier to force him and a he unarm a he be obstinately defend himself with hi fist and foot he make him lose hi life in the contest by that mean dissipating and diverting in a sudden and furious rage the painful apprehension of the linger death to which he be design we always think of something els either the hope of a good life comfort and support u or the hope of our children worth or the future glory of our name or the leave behind the evil of this life or the vengeance that threaten those who be the cause of our death administers consolation to u xenophon be sacrifice with a crown upon hi head when one come to

fatigue be not say xenophon so intolerable to a general of an army a to a common soldier epaminondas take hi death much more cheerfully have be inform that the victory remain to him and such like circumstance amuse divert and turn our thought from the consideration of the thing in itself even the argument of philosophy be always edge and glance on the matter so as scarce to rub it crust the great man of the first philosophical school and superintendent over all the rest the great zeno form this syllogism against death no evil be honourable but death be honourable therefore death be no evil against drunkenness this no one commit hi secret to a drunkard but every one commit hi secret to a wise man therefore a wise man be no drunkard be this to hit the white i love to see that these great and lead soul can not rid themselves of our company perfect men a they be they be yet simply men revenge be a sweet passion of great and natural impression i discern it well enough though i have no manner of experience of it from this not long ago to divert a young prince i do not tell him that he must to him that have strike him upon the one cheek turn the other upon account of charity nor go about to represent to him the tragical event that poetry attribute to this passion i leave that behind and i busy myself to make him relish the beauty of a contrary image and by represent to him what honour esteem and goodwill he would acquire by clemency and good nature divert him to ambition thus a man be to deal in such case if your passion of love be too violent disperse it say they and they say true for i have often try it with advantage break it into several desire of which let one be regent if you will over the rest but l it should tyrannise and domineer over you weaken and protract by divide and divert it and provide for it in time l it prove troublesome to deal with when it have once seize you i be once wound with a vehement displeasure and withal more just than vehement i might peradventure have lose myself in it if i have merely trust to my own strength have need of a powerful diversion to disengage me by art and study i become amorous wherein i be assist by my youth love relieve and rescue me from the evil wherein friendship have engage me ti in everything els the same a violent imagination hath seize me i find it a near way to change than to subdue it i depute if not one contrary yet another at least in it place variation ever relieve dissolve and dissipate if i be not able to contend with it i escape from it and in avoid it slip out of the way and make my double shift place business and company i secure myself in the crowd of other thought and fancy where it lose my trace and i escape after the same manner do nature proceed by the benefit of inconstancy for time which she have give u for the sovereign physician of our passion chiefly work by this that supply our imagination with other and new affair it loosen and dissolve the first apprehension how strong soever a wise man little less see hi friend die at the end of fiveandtwenty year than on the first year and accord to epicurus no less at all for he do not attribute any alleviation of affliction either to their foresight or their antiquity but so many other thought traverse this that it languish and tire at last alcibiades to divert the inclination of common rumour cut off the ear and tail of hi beautiful dog and turn him out into the public place to the end that give the people this occasion to prate they might let hi other action alone i have also see for this same end of divert the opinion and conjecture of the people and to stop their mouth some woman conceal their real affection by those that be only counterfeit but i have also see some of them who in counterfeit have suffer themselves to be catch indeed and who have quit the true and original affection for the feigned and so have learn that they who find their affection well place be fool to consent to this disguise the public and favourable reception be only reserve for this pretend lover one may conclude him a fellow of very little address and less wit if he do not in the end put himself into your place and you into hi this be precisely to cut out and make up a shoe for another to draw on a little thing will turn and divert u because a little thing hold u we do not much consider subject in gross and singly they be little and superficial circumstance or image that touch u and the outward useless rinds that peel off from the subject themselves even plutarch himself

that i examine it a little nearer i find tis no other but a grammatical and word complaint i be only wound with the word and tone a the exclamation of preacher very often work more upon their auditory than their reason and a the pitiful eye of a beast kill for our service without my weighing or penetrate meanwhile into the true and solid essence of my subject these be the foundation of our mourn the obstinacy of my stone to all remedy especially those in my bladder have sometimes throw me into so long suppression of urine for three or four day together and so near death that it have be folly to have hop to evade it and it be much rather to have be desire consider the misery i endure in those cruel fit oh that good emperor who cause criminal to be tie that they might die for want of urination be a great master in the hangman science find myself in this condition i consider by how many light cause and object imagination nourish in me the regret of life of what atoms the weight and difficulty of this dislodging be compose in my soul to how many idle and frivolous thought we give way in so great an affair a dog a horse a book a glass and what not be consider in my loss to other their ambitious hope their money their knowledge not less foolish consideration in my opinion than mine i look upon death carelessly when i look upon it universally a the end of life i insult over it in gross but in detail it domineer over me the tear of a footman the disposing of my clothes the touch of a friendly hand a common consolation discourages and softens me so do the complaint in tragedy agitate our soul with grief and the regret of dido and ariadne impassionate even those who believe them not in virgil and catullus ti a symptom of an obstinate and obdurate nature to be sensible of no

so vivid and entire a cause of sorrow by judgment that it do not suffer increase by it presence when the eye and ear have their share part that be not to be move but by vain accident be it reason that even the art themselves should make an advantage of our natural stupidity and weakness an orator say rhetoric in the farce of hi plead shall be move with the sound of hi own voice and feigned emotion and suffer himself to be impose upon by the passion he represent he will imprint in himself a true and real grief by mean of the part he play to transmit it to the judge who be yet less concerned than he a they do who be hire at funeral to assist in the ceremony of sorrow who sell their tear and mourn by weight and measure for although they act in a borrowed form nevertheless by habituate and settle their countenance to the occasion ti most certain they often be really affect with an actual sorrow i be one amongst several other of hi friend who convey the body of monsieur de grammont to spissons from the siege of la fere where he be slay i observe that in all place we pass through we fill the people we meet with lamentation and tear by the mere solemn pomp of our convoy for the name of the defunct be not there so much a known quintilian report a to have see comedian so deeply engage in a mourning part that they still weep in the retiring room and who have take upon them to stir up passion in another have themselves espouse it to that degree a to find themselves infect with it not only to tear but moreover with pallor and the comportment of men really overwhelm with grief in a country near our mountain the woman play priest martin for a they augment the regret of the deceased husband by the remembrance of the good and agreeable quality he possess they also at the same time make a register of and publish hi imperfection a if of themselves to enter into some composition and divert themselves from compassion to disdain yet with much good grace than we who when we lose an acquaintance strive to give him new and false praise and to make him quite another thing when we have lose sight of him than he appear to u when we do see him a if regret be an instructive thing or a if tear by wash our understanding clear them for my part i henceforth renounce all favourable testimony men would give of me not because i shall be worthy of them but because i shall be dead whoever shall ask a man what interest have you in this siege the interest of example he will say and of the common obedience to my prince i pretend to no profit by it and for glory i know how small a part can affect a private man such a i i have here neither passion nor quarrel and yet you shall see him the next day quite another man chafing and red with fury range in battle for the assault ti the glittering of so much steel the fire and noise of our cannon and drum that have infuse this new rigidity and fury into hi vein a frivolous cause you will say how a cause there need none to agitate the mind a mere whimsy without body and without subject will rule and agitate it let me thing of building castle in spain my imagination suggest to me convenience and pleasure with which my soul be really tickled and pleased how often do we torment our mind with anger or sorrow by such shadow and engage ourselves in fantastic passion that impair both soul and body what astonish fleet confused grimace do this raving put our face into what sally and agitation both of member and voice do it inspire u with doe it not seem that this individual man have false vision amid the crowd of other with whom he have to do or that he be possess with some internal demon that persecute him inquire of yourself where be the object of this mutation be there anything but u in nature which inanity sustain over which it have power cambyses from have dreamt that hi brother should be one day king of persia put him to death a beloved brother and one in whom he have always confide aristodemus king of the messenians kill himself out of a fancy of ill omen from i know not what howling of hi dog and king midas do as much upon the account of some foolish dream he have dream ti to prize life at it just value to abandon it for a dream and yet hear the soul triumph over the misery and weakness of the body and that it be expose to all attack and alteration truly it have reason so to speak by how much profitable thought be more full and solid by so much be they also more cumbersome and heavy vice death poverty disease be grave and grievous subject a man should have hi soul instruct in the mean to sustain and to contend with evil and in the rule of living and believe well and often rouse it up and exercise it in this noble study but in an ordinary soul it must be by interval and with moderation it will otherwise grow besotted if continually intent upon it i find it necessary when i be young to put myself in mind and solicit myself to keep me to my duty gaiety and health do not they say so well agree with those grave and serious meditation i be at present in another state the condition of age but too much put me in mind urge me to wisdom and preach to me from the excess of sprightliness i be fall into that of severity which be much more troublesome and for that reason i now and then suffer myself purposely a little to run into disorder and occupy my mind in wanton and youthful thought wherewith it divert itself i be of late but too reserve too heavy and too ripe year every day read to me lecture of coldness and temperance this body of mine avoids disorder and dread it tis now my body turn to guide my mind towards reformation it govern in turn and more rudely and imperiously than the other it let me not an hour alone sleep or wake but be always preach to me death patience and repentance i now defend myself from temperance a i have formerly do from pleasure it draw me too much back and even to stupidity now i will be master of myself to all intent and purpose wisdom have it excess and have no less need of moderation than folly therefore l i should wither dry up and overcharge myself with prudence in the interval and truce my infirmity allow me i gently turn aside and avert my eye from the stormy and cloudy sky i have before me which thanks be to god i regard without fear but not without meditation and study and amuse myself in the remembrance of my good year let childhood look forward and age backward be not this the signification of janus double face let year draw me along if they will but it shall be backward as long a my eye can discern the pleasant season expire i shall now and then turn them that way though it escape from my blood and vein i shall not however root the image of it out of my memory plato ordain that old men should be present at the exercise dance and sport of young people that they may rejoice in other for the activity and beauty of body which be no more in themselves and call to mind the grace and comeliness of that flourishing age and will that in these recreation the honour of the prize should be give to that young man who have most divert the company i be formerly wont to mark cloudy and gloomy day a extraordinary these be now my ordinary day the extraordinary be the clear and bright i be ready to leap for joy a for an unwonted favour when nothing happen me let me tickle myself i can not force a poor smile from this wretched body of mine i be only merry in conceit and in dream by artifice to divert the melancholy of age but in faith it require another remedy than a dream a weak contest of art against nature ti great folly to lengthen and anticipate human incommodities a every one do i have rather be a less while old than be old before i be really so i seize on even the least occasion of pleasure i can meet i know very well by hearsay several sort of prudent pleasure effectually so and glorious to boot but opinion have not power enough over me to give me an appetite to them i covet not so much to have them magnanimous magnificent and pompous a i do to have them sweet facile and ready my philosophy be in action in natural and present practice very little in fancy what if i should take pleasure in play at cobnut or to whip a top pleasure be a quality of very little ambition it think itself rich enough of itself without any addition of repute and be best pleased where most retire a young man should be whip who pretend to a taste in wine and sauce there be nothing which at that age i less value or know now i begin to learn i be very much ashamed ont but what should i do i be more ashamed and vexed at the occasion that put me upont ti for u to dote and trifle away the time and for young men to stand upon their reputation and nice punctilio they be go towards the world and the worlds opinion we be retire from it the law themselves send u home i can do no less in favour of this wretched condition into which my age have throw me than furnish it with toy to play withal a they do child and in truth we become such both wisdom and folly will have enough to do to support and relieve me by alternate service in this calamity of age i accordingly avoid the light puncture and those that formerly would not have ripple the skin now pierce me through and through my habit of body be now so naturally decline to ill i have ever be very susceptibly tender a to offence i be much more tender now and open throughout my judgment restrains me from kick against and murmur at the inconvenience that nature order me to endure but it do not take away my feel them i who have no other thing in my aim but to live and be merry would run from one end of the world to the other to seek out one good year of pleasant and jocund tranquillity a melancholic and dull tranquillity may be enough for me but it benumb and stupefies me i be not content with it if there be any person any knot of good company in country or city in france or elsewhere resident or in motion who can like my humour and whose humour i can like let them but whistle and i will run and furnish them with essay in flesh and bone see it be the privilege of the mind to rescue itself from old age i advise mine to it with all the power i have let it meanwhile continue green and flourish if it can like mistletoe upon a dead tree but i fear ti a traitor it have contract so strict a fraternity with the body that it leave me at every turn to follow that in it need i wheedle and deal with it apart in vain i try in vain to wean it from this correspondence to no effect quote to it seneca and catullus and lady and royal masque if it companion have the stone it seem to have it too even the faculty that be most peculiarly and properly it own can not then perform their function but manifestly appear stupefy and asleep there be no sprightliness in it production if there be not at the same time an equal proportion in the body too our master be to blame that in search out the cause of the extraordinary emotion of the soul besides attribute it to a divine ecstasy love martial fierceness poesy wine they have not also attribute a part to health a boiling vigorous full and lazy health such a formerly the verdure of youth and security by fit supply me withal that fire of sprightliness and gaiety dart into the mind flash that be lively and bright beyond our natural light and of all enthusiasms the most jovial if not the most extravagant it be then no wonder if a contrary state stupefy and clog my spirit and produce a contrary effect and yet would have me oblige to it for give a it want to make out much less consent to this stupidity than be the ordinary case with men of my age let u at least whilst we have truce drive away incommodities and difficulty from our commerce i love a gay and civil wisdom and fly from all sourness and austerity of manner all repellent mien be suspect by me i be very much of plato opinion who say that facile or harsh humour be great indication of the good or ill disposition of the mind socrates have a constant countenance but serene and smile not sourly austere like the elder crassus whom no one ever saw laugh virtue be a pleasant and gay quality i know very well that few will quarrel with the licence of my writing who have not more to quarrel with in the licence of their own thought i conform myself well enough to their inclination but i offend their eye tis a fine humour to strain the writing of plato to wrest hi pretended intercourse with phaedo dion stella and archeanassa i hate a froward and dismal spirit that slip over all the pleasure of life and seizes and feed upon misfortune like fly that can not stick to a smooth and polished body but fix and repose themselves upon craggy and rough place and like cuppingglasses that only suck and attract bad blood a to the rest i have enjoin myself to dare to say all that i dare to do even thought that be not to be publish displease me the bad of my action and quality do not appear to me so evil a i find it evil and base not to dare to own them every one be wary and discreet in confession but men ought to be so in action the boldness of do ill be in some sort compensate and restrain by the boldness of confess it whoever will oblige himself to tell all should oblige himself to do nothing that he must be force to conceal i wish that this excessive licence of mine may draw men to freedom above these timorous and mince virtue spring from our imperfection and that at the expense of my immoderation i may reduce them to reason a man must see and study hi vice to correct it they who conceal it from other commonly conceal it from themselves and do not think it close enough if they themselves see it they withdraw and disguise it from their own conscience the disease of the body explain themselves by their increase we find that to be the gout which we call a rheum or a strain the disease of the soul the great they be keep themselves the most obscure the most sick be the least sensible therefore it be that with an unrelenting hand they most often in full day be take to task open and tear from the hollow of the heart a in do well so in do ill the mere confession be sometimes satisfaction be there any deformity in do amiss that can excuse u from confess ourselves it be so great a pain to me to dissemble that i evade the trust of anothers secret want the courage to disavow my knowledge i can keep silent but deny i can not without the great trouble and violence to myself imaginable to be very secret a man must be so by nature not by obligation ti little worth in the service of a prince to be secret if a man be not a liar to boot if he who ask thales the milesian whether he ought solemnly to deny that he have commit adultery have apply himself to me i should have tell him that he ought not to do it for i look upon lie a a bad fault than the other thales advise him quite contrary bidding him swear to shield the great fault by the less nevertheless this counsel be not so much an election a a multiplication of vice upon which let u say this in pass that we deal liberally with a man of conscience when we propose to him some difficulty in counterpoise of vice but when we shut him up betwixt two vice he be put to a hard choice a origen be either to idolatrise or to suffer himself to be carnally abuse by a great ethiopian slave they bring to him he submit to the first condition and wrongly people say yet those woman of our time be not much out accord to their error who protest they have rather burden their conscience with ten men than one mass if it be indiscretion so to publish one error yet there be no great danger that it pass into example and custom for ariston say that the wind men most fear be those that lay them open we must tuck up this ridiculous rag that hide our manner they send their conscience to the stew and keep a starched countenance even traitor and assassin espouse the law of ceremony and there fix their duty so that neither can injustice complain of incivility nor malice of indiscretion ti pity but a bad man should be a fool to boot and that outward decency should palliate hi vice this roughcast only appertain to a good and sound wall that deserve to be preserve and white in favour of the huguenot who condemn our auricular and private confession i confess myself in public religiously and purely st augustin origeti and hippocrates have publish the error of their opinion i moreover of my manner i be greedy of make myself know and i care not to how many provide it be truly or to say good i hunger for nothing but i mortally hate to be mistake by those who happen to learn my name he who do all thing for honour and glory what can he think to gain by shew himself to the world in a vizor and by conceal hi true be from the people praise a humpback for hi stature he have reason to take it for an affront if you be a coward and men commend you for your valour be it of you they speak they take you for another i should like him as well who glorify himself in the compliment and congee that be make him a if he be master of the company when he be one of the least of the train archelaus king of macedon walk along the street somebody throw water on hi head which they who be with him say he ought to punish aye but say he whoever it be he do not throw the water upon me but upon him whom he take me to be socrates be tell that people speak ill of him not at all say he there be nothing in me of what they say for my part if any one should recommend me a a good pilot a be very modest or very chaste i should owe him no thanks and so whoever should call me traitor robber or drunkard i should be a little concerned they who do not rightly know themselves may fee themselves with false approbation not i who see myself and who examine myself even to my very bowels and who very well know what be my due i be content to be less commend provide i be well know i may be repute a wise man in such a sort of wisdom a i take to be folly i be vexed that my essay only serve the lady for a common piece of furniture and a piece for the hall this chapter will make me part of the watercloset i love to traffic with them a little in private public conversation be without favour and without savour in farewell we oftener than not heat our affection towards the thing we take leave of i take my last leave of the pleasure of this world these be our last embrace but let u come to my subject what have the act of generation so natural so necessary and so just do to men to be a thing not to be speak of without blush and to be exclude from all serious and moderate discourse we boldly pronounce kill rob betray and that we dare only to do betwixt the teeth be it to say the less we expend in word we may pay so much the more in think for it be certain that the word least in use most seldom write and best kept in be the best and most generally know no age no manner be ignorant of them no more than the word bread they imprint themselves in every one without be express without voice and without figure and the sex that most practises it be bind to say least of it ti an act that we have place in the franchise of silence from which to take it be a crime even to accuse and judge it neither dare we reprehend it but by periphrasis and picture a great favour to a criminal to be so execrable that justice think it unjust to touch and see him free and safe by the benefit of the severity of hi condemnation be it not here a in matter of book that sell good and become more public for be suppress for my part i will take aristotle at hi word who say that bashfulness be an ornament to youth but a reproach to old age these verse be preach in the ancient school a school that i much more adhere to than the modern it virtue appear to me to be great and the vice less i know not who could set pallas and the mus at variance with venus and make them cold towards love but i see no deity so well meet or that be more indebted to one another who will deprive the mus of amorous imagination will rob them of the best entertainment they have and of the noble matter of their work and who will make love lose the communication and service of poesy will disarm him of hi best weapon by this mean they charge the god of familiarity and good will and the protecting goddess of humanity and justice with the vice of ingratitude and unthankfulness i have not be so long cashier from the state and service of this god that my memory be not still perfect in hi force and value there be yet some remains of heat and emotion after the fever withered and droop a i be i feel yet some remains of the past ardour but from what i understand of it the force and power of this god be more lively and animate in the picture of poesy than in their own essence it have i know not what kind of air more amorous than love itself venus be not so beautiful naked alive and panting a she be here in virgil all that i find fault with in consider it be that he have represent her a little too passionate for a married venus in this discreet kind of couple the appetite be not usually so wanton but more grave and dull love hat that people should hold of any but itself and go but faintly to work in familiarity derive from any other title a marriage be alliance dowry therein sway by reason a much or more than grace and beauty men do not marry for themselves let them say what they will they marry a much or more for their posterity and family the custom and interest of marriage concern our race much more than u and therefore it be that i like to have a match carry on by a third hand rather than a man own and by another man like than that of the party himself and how much be all this opposite to the convention of love and also it be a kind of incest to employ in this venerable and sacred alliance the heat and extravagance of amorous licence a i think i have say elsewhere a man say aristotle must approach hi wife with prudence and temperance l in deal too lasciviously with her the extreme pleasure make her exceed the bound of reason what he say upon the account of conscience the physician say upon the account of health that a pleasure excessively lascivious voluptuous and frequent make the seed too hot and hinders conception ti say elsewhere that to a languishing intercourse a this naturally be to supply it with a due and fruitful heat a man must do it but seldom and at appreciable interval i see no marriage where the conjugal compatibility sooner fails than those that we contract upon the account of beauty and amorous desire there should be more solid and constant foundation and they should proceed with great circumspection this furious ardour be worth nothing they who think they honour marriage by join love to it do methinks like those who to favour virtue hold that nobility be nothing els but virtue they be indeed thing that have some relation to one another but there be a great deal of difference we should not so mix their name and title tis a wrong to them both so to confound them nobility be a brave quality and with good reason introduce but forasmuch a ti a quality depend upon other and may happen in a vicious person in himself nothing ti in estimate infinitely below virtue ti a virtue if it be one that be artificial and apparent depend upon time and fortune various in form accord to the country living and mortal without birth a the river nile genealogical and common of succession and similitude draw by consequence and a very weak one knowledge strength goodness beauty rich and all other quality fall into communication and commerce but this be consummate in itself and of no use to the service of other there be propose to one of our king the choice of two candidate for the same command of whom one be a gentleman the other not he order that without respect to quality they should choose him who have the most merit but where the worth of the competitor should appear to be entirely equal they should have respect to birth this be justly to give it it rank a young man unknown come to antigonus to make suit for hi father command a valiant man lately dead friend say he in such preferment a these i have not so much regard to the nobility of my soldier a to their prowess and indeed it ought not to go a it do with the officer of the king of sparta trumpeter fiddler cook the child of whom always succeed to their place how ignorant soever and be prefer before the most experienced in the trade they of calicut make of noble a sort of superhuman person they be interdicted marriage and all but warlike employment they may have of concubine their fill and the woman a many lover without be jealous of one another but tis a capital and irremissible crime to couple with a person of meaner condition than themselves and they think themselves pollute if they have but touch one in walk along and suppose their nobility to be marvellously interested and injure in it kill such a only approach a little too near them insomuch that the ignoble be oblige to cry out a they walk like the gondolier of venice at the turning of street for fear of jostling and the noble command them to step aside to what part they please by that mean these avoid what they repute a perpetual ignominy those certain death no time no favour of the prince no office or virtue or rich can ever prevail to make a plebeian become noble to which this custom contribute that marriage be interdict betwixt different trade the daughter of one of the cordwainers gild be not permit to marry a carpenter and parent be oblige to train up their child precisely in their own calling and not put them to any other trade by which mean the distinction and continuance of their fortune be maintain a good marriage if there be any such reject the company and condition of love and try to represent those of friendship ti a sweet society of life full of constancy trust and an infinite number of useful and solid service and mutual obligation which any woman who have a right taste would be loth to serve her husband in quality of a mistress if she be lodge in hi affection a a wife she be more honourably and securely place when he purport to be in love with another and work all he can to obtain hi desire let any one but ask him on which he have rather a disgrace should fall hi wife or hi mistress which of their misfortune would most afflict him and to which of them he wish the most grandeur the answer to these question be out of dispute in a sound marriage and that so few be observe to be happy be a token of it price and value if well form and rightly take ti the best of all human society we can not live without it and yet we do nothing but decry it it happen a with cage the bird without despair to get in and those within despair of get out socrates be ask whether it be more commodious to take a wife or not let a man take which course he will say he he will repent ti a contract to which the common saying may very fitly be apply there must be a concurrence of many quality in the construction it be find nowadays more convenient for simple and plebeian soul where delight curiosity and idleness do not so much disturb it but extravagant humour such a mine that hate all sort of obligation and restraint be not so proper for it might i have have my own will i would not have marry wisdom herself if she would have have me but tis to much purpose to evade it the common custom and usance of life will have it so the most of my action be guide by example not by choice and yet i do not go to it of my own voluntary motion i be lead and draw to it by extrinsic occasion for not only thing that be incommodious in themselves but also thing however ugly vicious and to be avoid may be render acceptable by some condition or accident so unsteady and vain be all human resolution and i be persuade to it when worse prepare and less tractable than i be at present that i have try what it be and as great a libertine a i be take to be i have in truth more strictly observe the law of marriage than i either promise or expect ti in vain to kick when a man have once put on hi fetter a man must prudently manage hi liberty but have once submit to obligation he must confine himself within the law of common duty at least do what he can towards it they who engage in this contract with a design to carry themselves in it with hatred and contempt do an unjust and inconvenient thing and the fine rule that i hear pas from hand to hand amongst the woman a a sacred oracle which be to say comport thyself towards him with a dissembled inimical and distrustful reverence a cry of war and defiance be equally injurious and hard i be too mild for such rugged design to say the truth i be not arrive to that perfection of ability and refinement of wit to confound reason with injustice and to laugh at all rule and order that do not please my palate because i hate superstition i do not presently run into the contrary extreme of irreligion if a man do not always perform hi duty he ought at least to love and acknowledge it tis treachery to marry without espouse let u proceed our poet represent a marriage happy in a good accord wherein nevertheless there be not much loyalty do he mean that it be not impossible but a woman may give the rein to her own passion and yield to the importunity of love and yet reserve some duty toward marriage and that it may be hurt without be totally break a serve man may cheat hi master whom nevertheless he do not hate beauty opportunity and destiny for destiny have also a hand int have attach her to a stranger though not so wholly peradventure but that she may have some remains of kindness for her husband they be two design that have several path lead to them without be confound with one another a woman may yield to a man she would by no mean have marry not only for the condition of hi fortune but for those also of hi person few men have make a wife of a mistress who have not repent it and even in the other world what an unhappy life do jupiter lead with hi whom he have first enjoy a a mistress ti a the proverb run to befoul a basket and then put it upon one head i have in my time in a good family see love shamefully and dishonestly cure by marriage the consideration be widely different we love at once without any tie two thing contrary in themselves socrates be wont to say that the city of athens please a lady do whom men court for love every one love to come thither to take a turn and pass away hi time but no one like it so well a to espouse it that be to inhabit there and to make it hi constant residence i have be vex to see husband hate their wife only because they themselves do them wrong we should not at all event methinks love them the less for our own fault they should at least upon the account of repentance and compassion be dearer to u they be different end he say and yet in some sort compatible marriage have utility justice honour and constancy for it share a flat but more universal pleasure love found itself wholly upon pleasure and indeed have it more full lively and sharp a pleasure inflame by difficulty there must be in it sting and smart ti no longer love if without dart and fire the bounty of lady be too profuse in marriage and dull the point of affection and desire to evade which inconvenience do but observe what pain lycurgus and plato take in their law woman be not to blame at all when they refuse the rule of life that be introduce into the world forasmuch a the men make them without their help there be naturally contention and brawl betwixt them and u and the strict friendship we have with them be yet mixed with tumult and tempest in the opinion of our author we deal inconsiderately with them in this after we have discover that they be without comparison more able and ardent in the practice of love than we and that the old priest testify a much who have be one while a man and then a woman and moreover that we have learn from their own mouth the proof that in several age be make by an emperor and empress of rome both famous for ability in that affair for he in one night deflower ten sarmatian virgin who be hi captive but she have fiveandtwenty bout in one night change her man accord to her need and liking and that upon the dispute which happen in cataluna wherein a wife complaining of her husband too frequent address to her not so much a i conceive that she be incommodated by it for i believe no miracle out of religion a under this pretence to curtail and curb in this which be the fundamental act of marriage the authority of husband over their wife and to shew that their froward and malignity go beyond the nuptial bed and spurn under foot even the grace and sweet of venus the husband a man truly brutish and unnatural reply that even on fast day he could not subsist with less than ten course whereupon come out that notable sentence of the queen of arragon by which after mature deliberation of her council this good queen to give a rule and example to all succeed age of the moderation require in a just marriage set down six time a day a a legitimate and necessary stint surrendering and quit a great deal of the need and desire of her sex that she might she say establish an easy and consequently a permanent and immutable rule

particular share and upon the last and extreme penalty there be no passion so hard to contend with a this which we would have them only resist not simply a an ordinary vice but a an execrable abomination bad than irreligion and parricide whilst we at the same time go tot without offence or reproach even those amongst u who have try the experiment have sufficiently confess what difficulty or rather impossibility they have find by material remedy to subdue weaken and cool the body we on the contrary would have them at once sound vigorous plump highfed and chaste that be to say both hot

fellow they be in a bad condition in marriage than either maid or widow we think them well provide for because they have a man to lie with a the roman conclude clodia laeta a vestal nun violate because caligula have approach her though it be declare he do no more but approach her but on the contrary we by that increase their necessity forasmuch a the touch and company of any man whatever rouse their desire that in solitude would be more quiet and to the end ti likely that they might render their chastity more meritorious by this circumstance and consideration boleslas and king hi wife king of poland vow it by mutual consent be in bed together on their very wedding day and keep their vow in spite of all matrimonial convenience we train them up from their infancy to the traffic of

bring up by her mother after a retired and particular manner so that she but now begin to be wean from her childish simplicity she be read before me in a french book where the word fouteau the name of a tree very well know occur the woman to whose conduct she be committed stop her short a little roughly and make her skip over that dangerous step i let her alone not to trouble their rule for i never concern myself in that sort of government feminine polity have a mysterious procedure we must leave it to them but if i be not mistake the commerce of twenty lacquies could not in six month time have so imprint in her memory the meaning usage and all the consequence of the sound of these wicked syllable a this good old woman do by reprimand and interdiction let them but give themselves the rein a little let them but enter into liberty of discourse we be but child to them in this science hear them but describe our pursuit and conversation they will very well make you understand that we bring them nothing they have not know before and digest without our help be it perhaps a plato say that they have formerly be debauch young fellow i happen one day to be in a place where i could hear some of their talk without suspicion i be sorry i can not repeat it byrlady say i we have need go study the phrase of amadis and the tale of boccaccio and aretin to be able to discourse with them we employ our time to much purpose indeed there be neither word example nor step they be not more perfect in than our book tis a discipline that spring with their blood which these good instructor nature youth and health be continually inspire them with they need not learn they breed it so that if the natural violence of their desire be not a little restrain by fear and honour which be wisely contrive for them we should be all sham all the motion in the world resolve into and tend to this conjunction tis a matter infuse throughout ti a centre to which all thing be direct we yet see the edict of the old and wise rome make for the service of love and the precept of socrates for the instruction of courtezans zeno amongst hi law also regulate the motion to be observe in get a maidenhead what be the philosopher stratos book of carnal conjunction and what do theophrastus treat of in those he intituled the one the lover and the other of love of what aristippus in hi of former delight what do the so long and lively description in plato of the love of hi time pretend to and the book call the lover of demetrius phalereus and clinias or the ravished lover of heraclides and that of antisthenes of getting child or of wedding and the other of the master or the lover and that of aristo of amorous exercise what those of cleanthes one of love the other of the art of love the amorous dialogue of sphaereus and the fable of jupiter and juno of chrysippus impudent beyond all toleration and hi fifty so lascivious epistle i will let alone the writing of the philosopher of the epicurean sect protectress of voluptuousness fifty deity be in time past assign to this office and there have be nation where to assuage the lust of those who come to their devotion they keep men and woman in their temple for the worshipper to lie with and it be an act of ceremony to do this before they go to prayer in the great part of the world that member of our body be deify in the same province some flay off the skin to offer and consecrate a piece other offer and consecrate their seed in another the young men publicly cut through betwixt the skin and the flesh of that part in several place and thrust piece of wood into the opening a long and thick a they would receive and of these piece of wood afterwards make a fire a an offering to their god and be repute neither vigorous nor chaste if by the force of that cruel pain they seem to be at all dismay elsewhere the most sacred magistrate be reverence and acknowledge by that member and in several ceremony the effigy of it be carry in pomp to the honour of various divinity the egyptian lady in their bacchanalia each carry one finelycarved of wood about their neck a large and heavy a she could so carry it besides which the statue of their god present one which in greatness surpass all the rest of hi body the married woman near the place where i live make of their kerchief the figure of one upon their forehead to glorify themselves in the enjoyment they have of it and come to be widow they throw it behind and cover it with their headcloths the most modest matron of rome think it an honour to offer flower and garland to the god priapus and they make the virgin at the time of their espousal sit upon hi shameful part and i know not whether i have not in my time see some air of like devotion what be the meaning of that ridiculous piece of the chaussuye of our forefather and that be still wear by our swiss to what end do we make a show of our implement in figure under our breech and often which be bad above their natural size by falsehood and imposture i have half a mind to believe that this sort of vestment be invent in the good and more conscientious age that the world might not be deceive and that every one should give a public account of hi proportion the simple nation wear them yet and near about the real size in those day the tailor take measure of it a the shoemaker do now of a man foot that good man who when i be young geld so many noble and ancient statue in hi great city that they might not corrupt the sight of the lady accord to the advice of this other ancient worthy should have call to mind that as in the mystery of the bona dea all masculine appearance be exclude he do nothing if he do not geld horse and ass in short all nature the god say plato have give u one disobedient and unruly member that like a furious animal attempt by the violence of it appetite to subject all thing to it and so they have give to woman one like a greedy and ravenous animal which if it be refuse food in season grows wild impatient of delay and infuse it rage into their body stop the passage and hinders respiration cause a thousand ills till have imbibe the fruit of the common thirst it have plentifully bedew the bottom of their matrix now my legislator should also have consider that peradventure it be a chaster and more fruitful usage to let them know the fact a it be betimes than permit them to guess accord to the liberty and heat of their own fancy instead of the real part they substitute through hope and desire other that be three time more extravagant and a certain friend of mine lose himself by produce hi in place and time when the opportunity be not present to put them to their more serious use what mischief do not those picture of prodigious dimension do that the boy make upon the staircase and gallery of the royal house they give the lady a cruel contempt of our natural furniture and what do we know but that plato after other wellinstituted republic order that the men and woman old and young should expose themselves naked to the view of one another in hi gymnastic exercise upon that very account the indian woman who see the men in their natural state have at least cool the sense of see and let the woman of the kingdom of pegu say what they will who below the waist have nothing to cover them but a cloth slit before and so strait that what decency and modesty soever they pretend by it at every step all be to be see that it be an invention to allure the men to them and to divert them from boy to whom that nation be generally incline yet peradventure they lose more by it than they get and one may venture to say that an entire appetite be more sharp than one already halfglutted by the eye livia be wont to say that to a virtuous woman a naked man be but a statue the lacedaemonian woman more virgin when wife than our daughter be saw every day the young men of their city strip naked in their exercise themselves little heed to cover their thigh in walk believe themselves say plato sufficiently cover by their virtue without any other robe but those of whom st augustin speaks have give nudity a wonderful power of temptation who have make it a doubt whether woman at the day of judgment shall rise again in their own sex and not rather in ours for fear of tempt u again in that holy state in brief we allure and flesh them by all sort of way we incessantly heat and stir up their imagination and then we find fault let u confess the truth there be scarce one of u who do not more apprehend the shame that accrue to him by the vice of hi wife than by hi own and that be not more solicitous a wonderful charity of the conscience of hi virtuous wife than of hi own who have not rather commit theft and sacrilege and that hi wife be a murderess and a heretic than that she should not be more chaste than her husband an unjust estimate of vice both we and they be capable of a thousand corruption more prejudicial and unnatural than lust but we weigh vice not accord to nature but accord to our interest by which mean they take so many unequal form the austerity of our decree render the application of woman to this vice more violent and vicious than it own condition need and engage it in consequence bad than their cause they will readily offer to go to the law court to seek for gain and to the war to get reputation rather than in the midst of ease and delight to have to keep so difficult a guard do not they very well see that there be neither merchant nor soldier who will not leave hi business to run after this sport or the porter or cobbler toil and tire out a they be with labour and hunger i do not know whether the exploit of alexander and caesar really surpass the resolution of a beautiful young woman breed up after our fashion in the light and commerce of the world assail by so many contrary example and yet keep herself entire in the midst of a thousand continual and powerful solicitation there be no do more difficult than that not do nor more active i hold it more easy to carry a suit of armour all the day of one life than a maidenhead and the vow of virginity of all other be the most noble a be the hard to keep say st jerome we have doubtless resign to the lady the most difficult and most vigorous of all human endeavour and let u resign to them the glory too this ought to encourage them to be obstinate in it tis a brave thing for them to defy u and to spurn under foot that vain preeminence of valour and virtue that we pretend to have over them they will find if they do but observe it that they will not only be much more esteemed for it but also much more beloved a gallant man do not give over hi pursuit for be refuse provide it be a refusal of chastity and not of choice we may swear threaten and complain to much purpose we therein do but lie for we love them all the good there be no allurement like modesty if it be not rude and crabbed ti stupidity and meanness to be obstinate against hatred and disdain but against a virtuous and constant resolution mixed with goodwill tis the exercise of a noble and generous soul they may acknowledge our service to a certain degree and give u civilly to understand that they disdain u not for the law that enjoin them to abominate u because we adore them and to hate u because we love them be certainly very cruel if but for the difficulty of it why should they not give ear to our offer and request so long a they be keep within the bound of modesty wherefore should we fancy them to have other thought within and to be bad than they seem a queen of our time say with spirit that to refuse these courtesy be a testimony of weakness in woman and a selfaccusation of facility and that a lady could not boast of her chastity who be never tempt the limit of honour be not cut so short they may give themselves a little rein and relax a little without be faulty there lie on the frontier some space free indifferent and neuter he that have beat and pursue her into her fort be a strange fellow if he be not satisfy with hi fortune the price of the conquest be consider by the difficulty would you know what impression your service and merit have make in her heart judge of

approbation by their mere constancy without care or artifice every one repents and give himself the lie for what he have believe and say and from girl a little suspected they have be afterward advanced to the first rank amongst the lady of honour somebody tell plato that all the world speak ill of him let them talk say he i will live so a to make them change their note besides the fear of god and the value of so rare a glory which ought to make them look to themselves the corruption of the age we live in compels them to it and if i be they there be nothing i would not rather do than intrust my reputation in so dangerous hand in my time the pleasure of tell a pleasure little inferior to that of do be not permit but to those who have some faithful and only friend but now the ordinary discourse and common tabletalk be nothing but boast of favour receive and the secret liberality of lady in earnest ti too abject too much meanness of spirit in men to suffer such ungrateful indiscreet and giddyheaded people so to persecute forage and rifle those tender and charming favour this our immoderate and illegitimate exasperation against this vice spring from the most vain and turbulent disease that afflict human mind which be jealousy she and envy her sister seem to me to be the most foolish of the whole troop a to the last i can say little about it tis a passion that though say to be so mighty and powerful have never to do with me a to the other i know it by sight and thats all beast feel it the shepherd cratis have fall in love with a shegoat the hegoat out of jealousy come a he lay asleep to butt the head of the female and crush it we have raise this fever to a great excess by the example of some barbarous nation the best discipline have be touch with it and tis reason but not transported lucullus caesar pompey antony cato and other brave men be cuckold and know it without make any bustle about it there be in those day but one coxcomb lepidus that die for grief that hi wife have use him so and the god of our poet when he surprise one of hi companion with hi wife satisfy himself by put them to shame only and nevertheless take anger at the lukewarm embrace she give him complain that upon that account she be grown jealous of hi affection nay she entreat arm for a bastard of hers which be freely grant and vulcan speak honourably of aeneas with in truth a more than human humanity and i be willing to leave this excess of kindness to the god a to the confusion of child besides that the grave legislator ordain and affect it in their republic it touch not the woman where this passion be i know not how much well seat when jealousy seize these poor soul weak and incapable of resistance ti pity to see how miserably it torment and tyrannise over them it insinuate itself into them under the title of friendship but after it have once possess them the same cause that serve for a foundation of goodwill serve them for a foundation of mortal hatred ti of all the disease of the mind that which the most thing serve for aliment and the few for remedy the virtue health merit reputation of the husband be incendiary of their fury and illwill this fever defaces and corrupts all they have of beautiful and good besides and there be no action of a jealous woman let her be how chaste and how good a housewife soever that do not relish of anger and wrangle ti a furious agitation that rebound them to an extremity quite contrary to it cause this hold good with one octavius at rome having lain with pontia posthumia he augment love with fruition and solicit with all importunity to marry her unable to persuade her this excessive affection precipitate him to the effect of the most cruel and mortal hatred he kill her in like manner the ordinary symptom of this other amorous disease be intestine hatred private conspiracy and cabal and a rage which so much the more fret itself a it be compel to excuse itself by a pretence of goodwill now the duty of chastity be of a vast extent be it the will that we would have them restrain this be a very supple and active thing a thing very nimble to be stay how if dreams sometimes engage them so far that they can not deny them it be not in them nor peradventure in chastity itself see that be a female to defend itself from lust and desire if we be only to trust to their will what a case be we in then do but imagine what crowd there would be amongst men in pursuance of the privilege to run full speed without tongue or eye into every woman arm who would accept them the scythian woman put out the eye of all their slave and prisoner of war that they might have their pleasure of them and they never the wiser o the furious advantage of opportunity should any one ask me what be the first thing to be consider in love matter i should answer that it be how to take a fitting time and so the second and so the third ti a point that can do everything i have sometimes want fortune but i have also sometimes be want to myself in matter of attempt god help him who yet make light of this there be great temerity require in this age of ours which our young men excuse under the name of heat but should woman examine it more strictly they would find that it rather proceed from contempt i be always superstitiously afraid of give offence and have ever have a great respect for her i love besides he who in this traffic take away the reverence defaces at the same time the lustre i would in this affair have a man a little play the child the timorous and the servant if not this i have in other bashfulness whereof altogether in thing some air of the foolish plutarch make mention and the course of my life have be diver way hurt and blemish with it a quality very ill suit my universal form and indeed what be we but sedition and discrepancy i be as much out of countenance to be deny a i be to deny and it so much trouble me to be troublesome to other that on occasion when duty compels me to try the goodwill of any one in a thing that be doubtful and that will be chargeable to him i do it very faintly and very much against my will but if it be for my own particular whatever homer truly say that modesty be a foolish virtue in an indigent person i commonly commit it to a third person to blush for me and deny those who employ me with the same difficulty so that it have sometimes befall me to have have a mind to deny when i have not the power to do it ti folly then to attempt to bridle in woman a desire that be so powerful in them and so natural to them and when i hear them brag of have so maidenly and so temperate a will i laugh at them they retire too far back if it be an old toothless trot or a young dry consumptive thing though it be not altogether to be believe at least they say it with more similitude of truth but they who still move and breathe talk at that ridiculous rate to their own prejudice by reason that inconsiderate excuse be a kind of selfaccusation like a gentleman a neighbour of mine suspect to be insufficient who three or four day after he be marry to justify himself go about boldly swear that he have ridden twenty stag the night before an oath that be afterwards make use of to convict him of hi ignorance in that affair and to divorce him from hi wife besides it signify nothing for there be neither continency nor virtue where there be no oppose desire it be true they may say but we will not yield saint themselves speak after that manner i mean those who boast in good gravity of their coldness and insensibility and who expect to be believe with a serious countenance for when ti speak with an affected look when their eye give the lie to their tongue and when they talk in the cant of their profession which always go against the hair ti good sport i be a great servant of liberty and plainness but there be no remedy if it be not wholly simple or childish ti silly and unbecoming lady in this commerce and presently run into impudence their disguise and figure only serve to cosen fool lie be there in it seat of honour ti a byway that by a backdoor lead u to truth if we can not curb their imagination what would we have from them effect there be enough of them that evade all foreign communication by which chastity may be corrupt and those which we fear the least be peradventure most to be fear their sin that make the least noise be the bad there be way by which they may lose their virginity without prostitution and which be more without their knowledge such a one by seek her maidenhead have lose it another by play with it have destroy it we can not precisely circumscribe the action we interdict them they must guess at our mean under general and doubtful term the very idea we invent for their chastity be ridiculous for amongst the great pattern that i have be fatua the wife of faunus who never after her marriage suffer herself to be see by any man whatever and the wife of hiero who never perceive her husband stink breath imagining that it be common to all men they must become insensible and invisible to satisfy u now let u confess that the knot of this judgment of duty principally lie in the will there have be husband who have suffer cuckoldom not only without reproach or take offence at their wife but with singular obligation to them and great commendation of their virtue such a woman have be who prize her honour above her life and yet have prostitute it to the furious lust of a mortal enemy to save her husband life and who in so do do that for him she would not have do for herself this be not the place wherein we be to multiply these example they be too high and rich to be set off with so poor a foil a i can give them here let u reserve them for a noble place but for example of ordinary lustre do we not every day see woman amongst u who surrender themselves for their husband sole benefit and by their express order and mediation and of old phaulius the argian who offer hi to king philip out of ambition a galba do it out of civility who have entertain maecenas at supper and observe that hi wife and he begin to cast glance at one another and to make eye and sign let himself sink down upon hi cushion like one in a profound sleep to give opportunity to their desire which he handsomely confess for thereupon a servant have make bold to lay hand on the plate upon the table he frankly cry what you rogue do you not see that i only sleep for maecenas such there may be whose manner may be lewd enough whose will may be more reform than another who outwardly carry herself after a more regular manner a we see some who complain of have vow chastity before they know what they do and i have also know other really complain of have be give up to debauchery before they be of the year of discretion the vice of the parent or the impulse of nature which be a rough counsellor may be the cause in the east indie though chastity be of singular reputation yet custom permit a married woman to prostitute herself to any one who present her with an elephant and that with glory to have be value at so high a rate phaedo the philosopher a man of birth after the taking of hi country elis make it hi trade to prostitute the beauty of hi youth so long a it last to any one that would for money thereby to gain hi living and solon be the first in greece ti say who by hi law give liberty to woman at the expense of their chastity to provide for the necessity of life a custom that herodotus say have be receive in many government before hi time and besides what fruit be there of this painful solicitude for what justice soever there be in this passion we be yet to consider whether it turn to account or no do any one think to curb them with all hi industry what commodity will not serve their turn in so know an age curiosity be vicious throughout but tis pernicious here ti folly to examine into a disease for which there be no physic that do not inflame and make it bad of which the shame grow still great and more public by jealousy and of which the revenge more wound our child than it heal u you wither and die in the search of so obscure a proof how miserably have they of my time arrive at that knowledge who have be so unhappy a to have find it out if the informer do not at the same time apply a remedy and bring relief ti an injurious information and that good deserve a stab than the lie we no less laugh at him who take pain to prevent it than at him who be a cuckold and know it not the character of cuckold be indelible who once have it carry it to hi grave the punishment proclaim it more than the fault it be to much purpose to drag out of obscurity and doubt our private misfortune thence to expose them on tragic scaffold and misfortune that only hurt u by be know for we say a good wife or a happy marriage not that they be really so but because no one say to the contrary men should be so discreet a to evade this tormenting and unprofitable knowledge and the roman have a custom when return from any expedition to send home before to acquaint their wife with their come that they might not surprise them and to this purpose it be that a certain nation have introduce a custom that the priest shall on the weddingday open the way to the bride to free the husband from the doubt and curiosity of examine in the first assault whether she come a virgin to hi bed or have be at the trade before but the world will be talk i know a hundred honest men cuckold honestly and not unbeseemingly a worthy man be pity not disesteem for it order it so that your virtue may conquer your misfortune that good men may curse the occasion and that he who wrong you may tremble but to think ont and moreover who escape be talk of at the same rate from the least even to the great seest thou how many honest men be reproach with this in thy presence believe that thou art no more spared elsewhere but the very lady will be laugh too and what be they so apt to laugh at in this virtuous age of ours a at a peaceable and wellcomposed marriage each amongst you have make somebody cuckold and nature run much in parallel in compensation and turn for turn the frequency of this accident ought long since to have make it more easy ti now pass into custom miserable passion which have this also that it be incommunicable for to what friend dare you intrust your grief who if he do not laugh at them will not make use of the occasion to get a share of the quarry the sharp as well a the sweet of marriage be keep secret by the wise and amongst it other troublesome condition this to a prate fellow a i be be one of the chief that custom have render it indecent and prejudicial to communicate to any one all that a man know and all that a man feel to give woman the same counsel against jealousy would be so much time lose their very be be so make up of suspicion vanity and curiosity that to cure them by any legitimate way be not to be hop they often recover of this infirmity by a form of health much more to be fear than the disease itself for a there be enchantment that can not take away the evil but by throw it upon another they also willingly transfer this ever to their husband when they shake it off themselves and yet i know not to speak truth whether a man can suffer bad from them than their jealousy ti the most dangerous of all their condition a the head be of all their member pittacus use to say that every one have hi trouble and that hi be the jealous head of hi wife but for which he should think himself perfectly happy a mighty inconvenience sure which could poison the whole life of so just so wise and so valiant a man what must we other little fellow do the senate of marseille have reason to grant him hi request who beg leave to kill himself that he might be deliver from the clamour of hi wife for ti a mischief that be never remove but by remove the whole piece and that have no remedy but flight or patience though both of them very hard he be methinks an understanding fellow who say twas a happy marriage betwixt a blind wife and a deaf husband let u also consider whether the great and violent severity of obligation we enjoin them do not produce two effect contrary to our design namely whether it do not render the pursuant more eager to attack and the woman more easy to yield for as to the first by raise the value of the place we raise the value and the desire of the conquest might it not be venus herself who so cunningly enhance the price of her merchandise by make the law her bawd know how insipid a delight it would be that be not heighten by fancy and hardness to achieve in short ti all swine flesh vary by sauce a flaminius host say cupid be a roguish god who make it hi sport to contend with devotion and justice ti hi glory that hi power mat all power and that all other rule give place to hi a to the second point should we not be less cuckold if we less fear to be so accord to the humour of woman whom interdiction incites and who be more eager be forbidden what good interpretation can we make of messalinas behaviour she at first make her husband a cuckold in private a be the common use but bring her business about with too much ease by reason of her husband stupidity she soon scorn that way and presently fell to make open love to own her lover and to favour and entertain them in the sight of all she would make him know and see how she use him this animal not to be rouse with all this and render her pleasure dull and flat by hi too stupid facility by which he seem to authorise and make them lawful what do she be the wife of a living and healthful emperor and at rome the theatre of the world in the face of the sun and with solemn ceremony and to silius who have long before enjoy her she publicly marry herself one day that her husband be go out of the city do it not seem a if she be go to become chaste by her husband negligence or that she seek another husband who might sharpen her appetite by hi jealousy and who by watch should incite her but the first difficulty she meet with be also the last this beast suddenly rouse these sleepy sluggish sort of men be often the most dangerous i have find by experience that this extreme toleration when it come to dissolve produce the most severe revenge for take fire on a sudden anger and fury be combine in one discharge their utmost force at the first onset he put her to death and with her a great number of those with whom she have intelligence and even one of them who could not help it and whom she have cause to be force to her bed with scourge what virgil say of venus and vulcan lucretius have well express of a stolen enjoyment betwixt her and mar when i consider this rejicit fiascit inhians ynolli fovet medulla labefacta pendet percurrit and that noble circumfusa mother of the pretty infuses i disdain those little quibble and verbal allusion that have since sprung up those worthy people stand in need of no subtlety to disguise their mean their language be downright and full of natural and continue vigour they be all epigram not only the tail but the head body and foot there be nothing forced nothing languish but everything keep the same pace ti not a soft eloquence and without offence only tis nervous and solid that do not so much please a it fill and ravish the great mind when i see these brave form of expression so lively so profound i do not say that ti well say but well thought ti the sprightliness of the imagination that swell and elevate the word our people call language judgment and fine word full conception this painting be not so much carry on by dexterity of hand a by have the object more vividly imprint in the soul gallus speak simply because he conceive simply horace do not content himself with a superficial expression that would betray him he see farther and more clearly into thing hi mind break into and rummage all the magazine of word and figure wherewith to express himself and he must have them more than ordinary because hi conception be so plutarch say that he see the latin tongue by the thing ti here the same the sense illuminates and produce the word no more word of air but of flesh and bone they signify more than they say moreover those who be not well skilled in a language present some image of this for in italy i say whatever i have a mind to in common discourse but in more serious talk i durst not have trust myself with an idiom that i could not wind and turn out of it ordinary pace i would have a power of introduce something of my own the handling and utterance of fine wit be that which set off language not so much by innovate it a by put it to more vigorous and various service and by strain bending and adapt it to them they do not create word but they enrich their own and give them weight and signification by the us they put them to and teach them unwonted motion but withal ingeniously and discreetly and how little this talent be give to all be manifest by the many french scribbler of this age they be bold and proud enough not to follow the common road but want of invention and discretion ruin them there be nothing see in their writing but a wretched affectation of a strange new style with cold and absurd disguise which instead of elevate depress the matter provide they can but trick themselves out with new word they care not what they signify and to bring in a new word by the head and shoulder they leave the old one very often more sinewy and significant than the other there be stuff enough in our language but there be a defect in cut out for there be nothing that might not be make out of our term of hunting and war which be a fruitful soil to borrow from and form of speak like herb improve and grow strong by be transplant i find it sufficiently abundant but not sufficiently pliable and vigorous it commonly quail under a powerful conception if you would maintain the dignity of your style you will often perceive it to flag and languish under you and there latin step in to it relief a greek do to other of some of these word i have just pick out we do not so easily discern the energy by reason that the frequent use of them have in some sort abase their beauty and render it common a in our ordinary language there be many excellent phrase and metaphor to be meet with of which the beauty be wither by age and the colour be sully by too common handle but that nothing lessen the relish to an understanding man nor do it derogate from the glory of those ancient author who tis likely first bring those word into that lustre the science treat of thing too refinedly after an artificial very different from the common and natural way my page make love and understand it but read to him leo hebraeus and ficinus where they speak of love it thought and action he understand it not i do not find in aristotle most of my ordinary motion they be there cover and disguise in another robe for the use of the school good speed them be i of the trade i would as much naturalise art a they artificialise nature let u let bembo and equicola alone when i write i can very well spare both the company and the remembrance of book l they should interrupt my progress and also in truth the best author too much humble and discourage me i be very much of the painter mind who have represent cock most wretchedly ill charge all hi boy not to suffer any natural cock to come into hi shop and have rather need to give myself a little lustre of the invention of antigenides the musician who when he be ask to sing or play take care beforehand that the auditory should either before or after be satiate with some other ill musician but i can hardly be without plutarch he be so universal and so full that upon all occasion and what extravagant subject soever you take in hand he will still be at your elbow and hold out to you a liberal and not to be exhaust hand of rich and embellishment it vex me that he be so exposed to be the spoil of those who be conversant with him i can scarce cast an eye upon him but i purloin either a leg or a wing and also for this design of mine ti convenient for me for me to write at home in a wild country where i have nobody to assist or relieve me where i hardly see a man who understand the latin of hi paternoster and of french a little less i might have make it well elsewhere but then the work would have be less my own and it principal end and perfection be to be exactly mine i readily correct an accidental error of which i be full a i run carelessly on but for my ordinary and constant imperfection it be a kind of treason to put them out when another tell me or that i say to myself thou art too thick of figure this be a word of rough gascon that be a dangerous phrase i do not reject any of those that be use in the common street of france they who would fight custom with grammar be trifler this be an ignorant discourse this be a paradoxical discourse that be go too far thou makest thyself too merry at time men will think thou sayest a thing in good earnest which thou only speakest in jest yes i know but i correct the fault of inadvertence not those of custom do i not talk at the same rate throughout do i not represent myself to the life ti enough that i have do what i design all the world know me in my book and my book in me now i have an apish imitative quality when i use to write verse and i never make any but latin they evidently discover the poet i have last read and some of my first essay have a little exotic taste i speak something another kind of language at paris than i do at montaigne whoever i steadfastly look upon easily leave some impression of hi upon me whatever i consider i usurp whether a foolish countenance a disagreeable look or a ridiculous way of speaking and vice most of all because they seize and stick to me and will not leave hold without shake i swear more by imitation than by complexion a murderous imitation like that of the ape so terrible both in stature and strength that alexander meet with in a certain country of the indie and which he would have have much ado any other way to have subdue but they afford him the mean by that inclination of theirs to imitate whatever they saw do for by that the hunter be teach to put on shoe in their sight and to tie them fast with many knot and to muffle up their head in cap all compose of run noose and to seem to anoint their eye with glue so do those poor beast employ their imitation to their own ruin they glue up their own eye halter and bind themselves the other faculty of play the mimic and ingeniously act the word and gesture of another purposely to make people merry and to raise their admiration be no more in me than in a stock when i swear my own oath ti only by god of all oaths the most direct they say that socrates swore by the dog zeno have for hi oath the same interjection at this time in use amongst the italian cappari pythagoras swore by water and air i be so apt without thinking of it to receive these superficial impression that if i have majesty or highness in my mouth three day together they come out instead of excellency and lordship eight day after and what i say today in sport and fooling i shall say the same tomorrow seriously wherefore in write i more unwillingly undertake beaten argument l i should handle them at anothers expense every subject be equally fertile to me a fly will serve the purpose and ti well if this i have in hand have not be undertake at the recommendation of a flighty a will i may begin with that which please me best for the subject be all link to one another but my soul displease me in that it ordinarily produce it deepest and most airy conceit and which please me best when i least expect or study for them and which suddenly vanish have at the instant nothing to apply them to on horseback at table and in bed but most on horseback where i be most give to think my speaking be a little nicely jealous of silence and attention if i be talk my best whoever interrupt me stop me in travel the necessity of the way will often put a stop to discourse besides which i for the most part travel without company fit for regular discourse by which mean i have all the leisure i would to entertain myself it fall out a it do in my dream whilst dream i recommend them to my memory for i be apt to dream that i dream but the next morning i may represent to myself of what complexion they be whether gay or sad or strange but what they be a to the rest the more i endeavour to retrieve them the deeper i plunge them in oblivion so of thought that come accidentally into my head i have no more but a vain image remain in my memory only enough to make me torment myself in their quest to no purpose well then lay book aside and more simply and materially speak i find after all that love be nothing els but the thirst of enjoy the object desire or venus any other thing than the pleasure of discharge one vessel just a the pleasure nature give in discharge other part that either by immoderation or indiscretion become vicious accord to socrates love be the appetite of generation by the mediation of beauty and when i consider the ridiculous titillation of this pleasure the absurd crackbrained wild motion with which it inspire zeno and cratippus the indiscreet rage the countenance inflame with fury and cruelty in the sweet effect of love and then that austere air so grave severe ecstatic in so wanton an action that our delight and our excrement be promiscuously shuffle together and that the supreme pleasure bring along with it a in pain fainting and complain i believe it to be true a plato say that the god make man for their sport and that it be in mockery that nature have order the most agitative of action and the most common to make u equal and to put fool and wise men beast and u on a level even the most contemplative and prudent man when i imagine him in this posture i hold him an impudent fellow to pretend to be prudent and contemplative they be the peacock foot that abate hi pride they who banish serious imagination from their sport do say one like him who dare not adore the statue of a saint if not cover with a veil we eat and drink indeed a beast do but these be not action that obstruct the function of the soul in these we maintain our advantage over them this other action subject all other think and by it imperious authority make an as of all plato divinity and philosophy and yet there be no complaint of it in everything els a man may keep some decorum all other operation submit to the rule of decency this can not so much a in imagination appear other than vicious or ridiculous find out if you can therein any serious and discreet procedure alexander say that he chiefly know himself to be mortal by this act and sleep sleep suffocates and suppress the faculty of the soul the familiarity with woman likewise dissipates and exhaust them doubtless ti a mark not only of our original corruption but also of our vanity and deformity on the one side nature push u on to it have fix the most noble useful and pleasant of all her function to this desire and on the other side leave u to accuse and avoid it a insolent and indecent to blush at it and to recommend abstinence are we not brutes to call that work brutish which beget u people of so many differ religion have concur in several propriety a sacrifice lamps burn incense fast and offering and amongst other in the condemning this act all opinion tend that way besides the widespread custom of circumcision which may be regard a a punishment we have peradventure reason to blame ourselves for be guilty of so foolish a production a man and to call the act and the part that be employ in the act shameful mine truly be now shameful and pitiful the essenians of whom pliny speak keep up their country for several age without either nurse or babyclouts by the arrival of stranger who follow this pretty humour come continually to them a whole nation be resolute rather to hazard a total extermination than to engage themselves in female embrace and rather to lose the succession of men than to beget one ti say that zeno never have to do with a woman but once in hi life and then out of civility that he might not seem too obstinately to disdain the sex every one avoid see a man bear every one run to see him die to destroy him a spacious field be seek out in the face of the sun but to make him we creep into a dark and private a corner

themselves who value themselves upon their contempt of themselves and purport to grow well by be bad what monstrous animal be this that be a horror to himself to whom hi delight be grievous and who wed himself to misfortune there be people who conceal their life and withdraw them from the sight of other men who avoid health and cheerfulness a dangerous and prejudicial quality not only many sect but many people curse their birth and bless their death and there be a place where the sun be abominate and darkness adore we be only ingenious in use ourselves ill tis the real quarry our intellect

feverish raving and we should serve and pay it accordingly let u teach the lady to set a good value and esteem upon themselves to amuse and fool u we give the last charge at the first onset the french impetuosity will still show itself by spin out their favour and expose them in small parcel even miserable old age itself will find some little share of reward accord to it worth and merit he who have

sooner ours than we be no more theirs and thrasonides a young man of greece be so in love with hi passion that have gain a mistresss consent he refuse to enjoy her that he might not by fruition quench and stupefy the unquiet ardour of which he be so proud and with which he so feed himself dearness be a good sauce to meat do but observe how much the manner of salutation particular to our nation have by it facility make kiss which socrates say be so powerful and dangerous for the stealing of heart of no esteem it be a displease custom and injurious for the lady that they must be oblige to lend their lip to every fellow who have three footman at hi heel however illfavoured he may be in himself and we ourselves barely gain by it for a the world be divide for three beautiful woman we must kiss fifty ugly one and to a tender stomach like those of my age an ill kiss overpay a good one in italy they passionately court even their common woman who sell themselves for money and justify the do so by say that there be degree of fruition and that by such service they would procure for themselves that which be most entire the woman sell nothing but their body the will be too free and too much of it own to be expose to sale so that these say ti the will they undertake and they have reason ti indeed the will that we be to serve and gain by woo i abhor to imagine mine a body without affection and this madness be methinks cousingerman to that of the boy who would need pollute the beautiful statue of venus make by praxiteles or that of the furious egyptian who violate the dead carcase of a woman he be embalm which be the occasion of the law then make in egypt that the corps of beautiful young woman of those of good quality should be keep three day before they should be deliver to those whose office it be to take care for the interment periander do more wonderfully who extend hi conjugal affection more regular and legitimate to the enjoyment of hi wife melissa after she be dead doe it not seem a lunatic humour in the moon seeing she could no otherwise enjoy her darling endymion to layhim for several month asleep and to please herself with the fruition of a boy who stir not but in hi sleep i likewise say that we love a body without a soul or sentiment when we love a body without it consent and desire all enjoyment be not alike there be some that be hectic and languish a thousand other cause besides goodwill may procure u this favour from the lady this be not a sufficient testimony of affection treachery may lurk there as well a elsewhere they sometimes go tot by half i know some who have rather lend that than their coach and who only impart themselves that way you be to examine whether your company please them upon any other account or a some strongchined groom for that only in what degree of favour and esteem you be with them what if they eat your bread with the sauce of a more pleasing imagination what have we not see one in these day of ours who make use of this act for the purpose of a most horrid revenge by that mean to kill and poison a he do a worthy lady such a know italy will not think it strange if for this subject i seek not elsewhere for example for that nation may be call the regent of the world in this they have more generally handsome and few ugly woman than we but for rare and excellent beauty we have as many a they i think the same of their intellect of those of the common sort they have evidently far more brutish be immeasurably rarer there but in individual character of the high form we be nothing indebted to them if i should carry on the comparison i might say a touch valour that on the contrary it be to what it be with them common and natural with u but sometimes we see them possess of it to such a degree a surpass the great example we can produce the marriage of that country be defective in this their custom commonly impose so rude and so slavish a law upon the woman that the most distant acquaintance with a stranger be a capital an offence a the most intimate so that all approach be render necessarily substantial and see that all come to one account they have no hard choice to make and when they have break down the fence we may safely presume they get on fire they must give them a little more rein the desire of company be allay by give it a little liberty we be pretty much in the same case they be extreme in constraint we in licence ti a good custom we have in france that our son be receive into the best family there to be entertain and breed up page a in a school of nobility and ti look upon a a discourtesy and an affront to refuse this to a gentleman i have take notice for so many family so many differ form that the lady who have be strictest with their maid have have no good luck than those who allow them a great liberty there should be moderation in these thing one must leave a great deal of their conduct to their own discretion for when all come to all no discipline can curb them throughout but it be true withal that she who come off with fly colour from a school of liberty brings with her whereon to repose more confidence than she who come away sound from a severe and strict school our father dress up their daughter look in bashfulness and fear their courage and desire be the same we ours in confidence and assurance we understand nothing of the matter we must leave it to the sarmatian woman who may not lie with a man till with their own hand they have first kill another in battle for me who have no other title leave me to these thing but by the ear tis sufficient if accord to the privilege of my age they retain me for one of their counsel i advise them then and u men too to abstinence but if the age we live in will not endure it at least modesty and discretion for a in the story of aristippus who speak to some young men who blush to see him go into a scandalous house say the vice be in not come out not in go in let her who have no care of her conscience have yet some regard to her reputation and though she be rotten within let her carry a fair outside at least i commend a gradation and delay in bestow their favour plato declare that in all sort of love facility and promptness be forbid to the defendant ti a sign of eagerness which they ought to disguise with all the art they have so rashly wholly and handoverhand to surrender themselves in carry themselves orderly and measuredly in the grant their last favour they much more allure our desire and hide their own let them still fly before u even those who have most mind to be overtake they good conquer u by fly a the scythian do to say the truth accord to the law that nature have impose upon them it be not properly for them either to will or desire their part be to suffer obey and consent and for this it be that nature have give them a perpetual capacity which in u be but at time and uncertain they be always fit for the encounter that they may be always ready when we be so pati natee and whereas she have order that our appetite shall be manifest by a prominent demonstration she would have theirs to be hide and conceal within and have furnish them with part improper for ostentation and simply defensive such proceeding a this that follow must be leave to the amazonian licence alexander march hi army through hyrcania thalestris queen of the amazon come with three hundred light horse of her ownsex well mount and arm have leave the remainder of a very great army that follow her behind the neighbouring mountain to give him a visit where she publicly and in plain term tell him that the fame of hi valour and victory have bring her thither to see him and to make him an offer of her force to assist him in the pursuit of hi enterprise and that find him so handsome young and vigorous she who be also perfect in all those quality advise that they might lie together to the end that from the most valiant woman of the world and the brave man then live there might spring some great and wonderful issue for the time to come alexander return her thanks for all the rest but to give leisure for the accomplishment of her last demand he detain her thirteen day in that place which be spend in royal feasting and jollity for the welcome of so courageous a princess we be almost throughout unjust judge of their action a they be of ours i confess the truth when it make against me as well a when ti on my side ti an abominable intemperance that push them on so often to change and that will not let them limit their affection to any one person whatever a be evident in that goddess to whom be attribute so many change and so many lover but ti true withal that tis contrary to the nature of love if it be not violent and contrary to the nature of violence if it be constant and they who wonder exclaim and keep such a clutter to find out the cause of this frailty of theirs a unnatural and not to be believe how come it to pass they do not discern how often they be themselves guilty of the same without any astonishment or miracle at all it would peradventure be more strange to see the passion fix ti not a simply corporeal passion if there be no end to avarice and ambition there be doubtless no more in desire it still live after satiety and ti impossible to prescribe either constant satisfaction or end it ever go beyond it possession and by that mean inconstancy peradventure be in some sort more pardonable in them than in u they may plead as well a we the inclination to variety and novelty common to u both and secondly without u that they buy a cat in a sack joanna queen of naples cause her first husband andrew to be hang at the bar of her window in a halter of gold and silk woven with her own hand because in matrimonial performance she neither find hi part nor ability answer the expectation she have conceive from hi stature beauty youth and activity by which she have be catch and deceive they may say there be more pain require in do than in suffering and so they be on their part always at least provide for necessity whereas on our part it may fall out otherwise for this reason it be that plato wisely make a law that before marriage to determine of the fitness of person the judge should see the young men who pretend to it strip stark naked and the woman but to the girdle only when they come to try u they do not perhaps find u worthy of their choice ti not enough that a man will be good weakness and insufficiency lawfully break a marriage why not and accord to her own standard an amorous intelligence more licentious and active but be it not great impudence to offer our imperfection and imbecility where we desire to please and leave a good opinion and esteem of ourselves for the little that i be able to do now i would not trouble a woman that i be to reverence and fear nature should satisfy herself in have render this age miserable without render it ridiculous too i hate to see it for one poor inch of pitiful vigour which come upon it but thrice a week to strut and set itself out with as much eagerness a if it could do mighty feats a true flame of flax and laugh to see it so boil and bubble and then in a moment so congealed and extinguish this appetite ought to appertain only to the flower of beautiful youth trust not to it seconding that indefatigable full constant magnanimous ardour you think in you for it will certainly leave you in a pretty corner but rather transfer it to some tender bashful and ignorant boy who yet tremble at the rod and blush who can stay till the morning without die for shame to behold the disdain of the fair eye of her who know so well hi fumble impertinence have never have the satisfaction and the glory of have cudgel them till they be weary with the vigorous performance of one heroic night when i have observe any one to be vex with me i have not presently accuse her levity but have be in doubt if i have not reason rather to complain of nature she have doubtless use me very uncivilly and unkindly and do me a most enormous injury every member i have as much one a another be equally my own and no other more properly make me a man than this i universally owe my entire picture to the public the wisdom of my instruction consist in liberty in truth in essence disdaining to introduce those little feigned common and provincial rule into the catalogue of it real duty all natural general and constant of which civility and ceremony be daughter indeed but illegitimate we be sure to have the vice of appearance when we shall have have those of essence when we have do with these we run full drive upon the other if we find it must be so for there be danger that we shall fancy new office to excuse our negligence towards the natural one and to confound them and to manifest this be it not see that in place where fault be crime crime be but fault that in nation where the law of decency be most rare and most remiss the primitive law of common reason be well observe the innumerable multitude of so many duty stifle and dissipate our care the application of ourselves to light and trivial thing divert u from those that be necessary and just oh how these superficial men take an easy and plausible way in comparison of ours these be shadow wherewith we palliate and pay one another but we do not pay but inflame the reckoning towards that great judge who tuck up our rag and tatter above our shameful part and suckles not to view u all over even to our inmost and most secret ordure it be a useful decency of our maidenly modesty could it keep him from this discovery in fine whoever could reclaim man from so scrupulous a verbal superstition would do the world no great disservice our life be divide betwixt folly and prudence whoever will write of it but what be reverend and canonical will leave above the onehalf behind i do not excuse myself to myself and if i do it should rather be for my excuse that i would excuse myself than for any other fault i excuse myself of certain humour which i think more strong in number than those that be on my side in consideration of which i will far say this for i desire to please every one though it will be hard to do that they ought not to condemn me for what i make authority receive and approve by so many age to utter and that there be no reason that for want of rhyme they should refuse me the liberty they allow even to churchman of our nation and time and these amongst the most notable of which here be two of their brisk verse besides how many other i love modesty and ti not out of judgment that i have choose this scandalous way of speak ti nature that have choose it for me i commend it not no more than other form that be contrary to common use but i excuse it and by circumstance both general and particular alleviate it accusation but to proceed whence too can proceed that usurpation of sovereign authority you take upon you over the woman who favour you at their own expense so that you presently assume the interest coldness and authority of a husband ti a free contract why do you not then keep to it a you would have them do there be no prescription upon voluntary thing ti against the form but it be true withal that i in my time have conduct this bargain as much a the nature of it would permit a conscientiously and with as much colour of justice a any other contract and that i never pretend other affection than what i really have and have truly acquaint them with it birth vigour and declination it fit and intermission a man do not always hold on at the same rate i have be so spar of my promise that i think i have be good than my word they have find me faithful even to service of their inconstancy a confess and sometimes multiplied inconstancy i never break with them whilst i have any hold at all and what occasion soever they have give me never break with them to hatred or contempt for such privacy though obtain upon never so scandalous term do yet oblige to some good will i have sometimes upon their trick and evasion discover a little indiscreet anger and impatience for i be naturally subject to rash emotion which though light and short often spoil my market at any time they have consult my judgment i never stick to give them sharp and paternal counsel and to pinch them to the quick if i have leave them any cause to complain of me tis rather to have find in me in comparison of the modern use a love foolishly conscientious than anything els i have keep my word in thing wherein i might easily have be dispense they sometimes surrender themselves with reputation and upon article that they be willing enough should be break by the conqueror i have more than once make pleasure in it great effort strike to the interest of their honour and where reason importune me have arm them against myself so that they order themselves more decorously and securely by my rule when they frankly refer themselves to them than they would have do by their own i have ever as much a i could wholly take upon myself alone the hazard of our assignation to acquit them and have always contrive our meeting after the hard and most unusual manner a less suspected and moreover in my opinion more accessible they be chiefly more open where they think they be most securely shut thing least fear be least interdicted and observe one may more boldly dare what nobody think you dare which by it difficulty become easy never have any man hi approach more impertinently generative this way of loving be more accord to discipline but how ridiculous it be to our people and how ineffectual who well know than i yet i shall not repent me of it i have nothing there more to lose ti now time to speak out but a i might per adventure say to another thou talkest idly my friend the love of thy time have little commerce with faith and integrity on the contrary also if it be for me to begin again certainly it should be by the same method and the same progress how fruitless soever it might be to me folly and insufficiency be commendable in an incommendable action the farther i go from their humour in this i approach so much nearer to my own a to the rest in this traffic i do not suffer myself to be totally carried away i please myself in it but do not forget myself i retain the little sense and discretion that nature have give me entire for their service and my own a little emotion but no dotage my conscience also be engage in it even to debauch and licentiousness but a to ingratitude treachery malice and cruelty never i would not purchase the pleasure of this vice at any price but content myself with it proper and simple cost i almost equally hate a stupid and slothful laziness a i do a toilsome and painful employment this pinch the other lay me asleep i like wound as well a bruise and cut as well a dry blow i find in this commerce when i be the most able for it a just moderation betwixt these extreme love be a sprightly lively and gay agitation i be neither troubled nor afflicted with it but heat and moreover disorder a man must stop there it hurt nobody but fool a young man ask the philosopher panetius if it be become a wise man to be in love let the wise man look to that answer he but let not thou and i who be not so engage ourselves in so stirring and violent an affair that enslave u to other and render u contemptible to ourselves he say true that we be not to intrust a thing so precipitous in itself to a soul that have not wherewithal to withstand it assault and disprove practically the saying of agesilaus that prudence and love can not live together ti a vain employment ti true unbecoming shameful and illegitimate but carry on after this manner i look upon it a wholesome and proper to enliven a drowsy soul and to rouse up a heavy body and a an experienced physician i would prescribe it to a man of my form and condition as soon a any other recipe whatever to rouse and keep him in vigour till well advance in year and to defer the approach of age whilst we be but in the suburb and that the pulse yet beat we have need to be solicit and tickle by some such nipping incitation a this do but observe what youth vigour and gaiety it inspire the good anacreon withal and socrates who be then old than i speak of an amorous object leaning say he my shoulder to her shoulder and my head to hers a we be read together in a book i felt without dissemble a sudden sting in my shoulder like the biting of an insect which i still felt above five day after and a continual itching crept into my heart so that merely the accidental touch and of a shoulder heat and alter a soul cool and enerved by age and the strict liver of all mankind and pray why not socrates be a man and would neither be nor seem any other thing philosophy do not contend against natural pleasure provide they be moderate and only preaches moderation not a total abstinence the power of it resistance be employ against those that be adulterate and strange philosophy say that the appetite of the body ought not to be augment by the mind and ingeniously warn u not to stir up hunger by saturity not to stuff instead of merely fill the belly to avoid all enjoyment that may bring u to want and all meat and drink that bring thirst and hunger a in the service of love she prescribe u to take such an object a may simply satisfy the body need and do not stir the soul which ought only barely to follow and assist the body without mix in the affair but have i not reason to hold that these precept which indeed in my opinion be somewhat over strict only concern a body in it best plight and that in a body break with age a in a weak stomach ti excusable to warm and support it by art and by the mediation of the fancy to restore the appetite and cheerfulness it have lose of itself may we not say that there be nothing in u during this earthly prison that be purely either corporeal or spiritual and that we injuriously break up a man alive and that it seem but reasonable that we should carry ourselves a favourably at least towards the use of pleasure a we do towards that of pain pain be for example vehement even to perfection in the soul of the saint by penitence the body have there naturally a sham by the right of union and yet might have but little part in the cause and yet be they not content that it should barely follow and assist the afflicted soul they have afflict itself with grievous and special torment to the end that by emulation of one another the soul and body might plunge man into misery by so much more salutiferous a it be more severe in like manner be it not injustice in bodily pleasure to subdue and keep under the soul and say that it must therein be drag along a to some enforce and servile obligation and necessity ti rather her part to hatch and cherish them there to present herself and to invite them the authority of rule belong to her a it be also her part in my opinion in pleasure that be proper to her to inspire and infuse into the body all the sentiment it be capable of and to study how to make them sweet and useful to it for it be good reason a they say that the body should not pursue it appetite to the prejudice of the mind but why be it not also the reason that the mind should not pursue hers to the prejudice of the body i have no other passion to keep me in breath what avarice ambition quarrel lawsuit do for other who like me have no particular vocation love would much more commodiously do it would restore to me vigilance sobriety grace and the care of my person it would reassure my countenance so that the grimace of old age those deform and dismal look might not come to disgrace it would again put me upon sound and wise study by which i might render myself more loved and esteem clear my mind of the despair of itself and of it use and redintegrating it to itself would divert me from a thousand troublesome thought a thousand melancholic humour that idleness and the ill posture of our health load u withal at such an age would warm again in dream at least the blood that nature be abandon would hold up the chin and a little stretch out the nerve the vigour and gaiety of life of that poor man who be go full drive towards hi ruin but i very well understand that it be a commodity hard to recover by weakness and long experience our taste be become more delicate and nice we ask most when we bring least and be hard to choose when we least deserve to be accept and know ourselves for what we be we be less confident and more distrustful nothing can assure u of be beloved consider our condition and theirs i be out of countenance to see myself in company with those young wanton creature to what end should we go insinuate our misery amid their gay and sprightly humour they have strength and reason on their side let u give way we have nothing to do there and these blossom of spring beauty suffer not themselves to be handle by such benumbed hand nor dealt with by mere material mean for a the old philosopher answer one who jeer him because he could not gain the favour of a young girl he make love to friend the hook will not stick in such soft cheese it be a commerce that require relation and correspondence the other pleasure we receive may be acknowledge by recompense of another nature but this be not to be pay but with the same kind of coin in earnest in this sport the pleasure i give more tickle my imagination than that they give me now he have nothing of generosity in him who can receive pleasure where he confer none it must needs be a mean soul that will owe all and can be content to maintain relation with person to whom he be a continual charge there be no beauty grace nor privacy so exquisite that a gentleman ought to desire at this rate if they can only be kind to u out of pity i have much rather die than live upon charity i would have right to ask in the style wherein i hear them beg in italy fate ben per voi or after the manner that cyrus exhort hi soldier who love himself let him follow me consort yourself some one will say to me with woman of your own condition whom like fortune will render more easy to your desire o ridiculous and insipid composition xenophon lay it for an objection and an accusation against menon that he never make love to any but old woman for my part i take more pleasure in but see the just and sweet mixture of two young beauty or only in meditate on it in my fancy than myself in act second in a pitiful and imperfect conjunction i leave that fantastic appetite to the emperor galba who be only for old curry flesh and to this poor wretch amongst chief deformity i reckon force and artificial beauty hemon a young boy of chios thinking by fine dress to acquire the beauty that nature have deny him come to the philosopher arcesilaus and ask him if it be possible for a wise man to be in love yes reply he provide it be not with a farded and adulterated beauty like thine ugliness of a confessed antiquity be to me less old and less ugly than another that be polish and plaster up shall i speak it without the danger of have my throat cut love in my opinion be not properly and naturally in it season but in the age next to childhood nor beauty neither for whereas homer extend it so far a to the budding of the beard plato himself have remark this a rare and the reason why the sophist bion so pleasantly call the first appear hair of adolescence aristogitons and harmodiuses be sufficiently know i find it in virility already in some sort a little out of date though not so much a in old age and marguerite queen of navarre like a woman very far extend the advantage of woman ordain that it be time at thirty year old to convert the title of fair into that of good the short authority we give to love over our life tis so much the good for u do but observe hi port ti a beardless boy who know not how in hi school they proceed contrary to all order study exercise and usage be their way for insufficiency there novice rule doubtless hi conduct be much more graceful when mixed with inadvertency and trouble miscarriage and ill success give him point and grace provide it be sharp and eager ti no great matter whether it be prudent or no do but observe how he go reel trip and play you put him in the stock when you guide him by art and wisdom and he be restrain of hi divine liberty when put into those hairy and callous clutch a to the rest i often hear the woman set out this intelligence a entirely spiritual and disdain to put the interest the sens there have into consideration everything there serve but i can say that i have often see that we have excuse the weakness of their understanding in favour of their outward beauty but have never yet see that in favour of mind how mature and full soever any of them would hold out a hand to a body that be never so little in decadence why do not some one of them take it into her head to make that noble socratical bargain between body and soul purchase a philosophical and spiritual intelligence and generation at the price of her thigh which be the high price she can get for them plato ordain in hi law that he who have perform any signal and advantageous exploit in war may not be refuse during the whole expedition hi age or ugliness notwithstanding a kiss or any other amorous favour from any woman whatever what he think to be so just in recommendation of military valour why may it not be the same in recommendation of any other good quality and why do not some woman take a fancy to possess over her companion the glory of this chaste love i may well say chaste the vice that be stifle in the thought be not the bad to conclude this notable commentary which have escape from me in a torrent of babble a torrent sometimes impetuous and hurtful i say that male and female be cast in the same mould and that education and usage except the difference be not great plato indifferently invite both the one and the other to the society of all study exercise and vocation both military and civil in hi commonwealth and the philosopher antisthenes reject all distinction betwixt their virtue and ours it be much more easy to accuse one sex than to excuse the other ti accord to the say it be very easy to verify that great author when they write of cause not only make use of those they think to be the true cause but also of those they believe not to be so provide they have in them some beauty and invention they speak true and usefully enough if it be ingeniously we can not make ourselves sure of the supreme cause and therefore crowd a great many together to see if it may not accidentally be amongst them do you ask me whence come the custom of bless those who sneeze we break wind three several way that which sallies from below be too filthy that which break out from the mouth carry with it some reproach of gluttony the third be sneeze which because it proceed from the head and be without offence we give it this civil reception do not laugh at this distinction they say tis aristotle i think i have see in plutarch who of all the author i know be he who have best mixed art with nature and judgment with knowledge hi give a a reason for the rising of the stomach in those who be at sea that it be occasion by fear have first find out some reason by which he prove that fear may produce such an effect i who be very subject to it know well that this cause concern not me and i know it not by argument but by necessary experience without instance what have be tell me that the same thing often happen in beast especially hog who be out of all apprehension of danger and what an acquaintance of mine tell me of himself that though very subject to it the disposition to vomit have three or four time go off him be very afraid in a violent storm a it happen to that ancient i be never afraid upon the water nor indeed in any other peril and i have have enough before my eye that would have suffice if death be one so a to be astound to lose my judgment fear spring sometimes as much from want of judgment a from want of courage all the danger i have be in i have look upon without wink with an open sound and entire sight and indeed a man must have courage to fear it formerly serve me good than other help so to order and regulate my retreat that it be if not without fear nevertheless without affright and astonishment it be agitate indeed but not amaze or stupefy great soul go yet much farther and present to u flight not only steady and temperate but moreover lofty let u make a relation of that which alcibiades report of socrates hi fellow in arm i find him say he after the rout of our army him and lachez last among those who flee and consider him at my leisure and in security for i be mount on a good horse and he on foot a he have fight i take notice in the first place how much judgment and resolution he show in comparison of lachez and then the bravery of hi march nothing different from hi ordinary gait hi sight firm and regular consider and judge what pass about him look one while upon those and then upon other friend and enemy after such a manner a encourage those and signify to the other that he would sell hi life dear to any one who should attempt to take it from him and so they come off for people be not willing to attack such kind of men but pursue those they see be in a fright that be the testimony of this great captain which teach u what we every day experience that nothing so much throw u into danger a an inconsiderate eagerness of get ourselves clear of them our people be to blame who say that such an one be afraid of death when they would express that he think of it and foresee it foresight be equally convenient in what concern u whether good or ill to consider and judge of danger be in some sort the reverse to be astound i do not find myself strong enough to sustain the force and impetuosity of this passion of fear nor of any other vehement passion whatever if i be once conquer and beat down by it i should never rise again very sound whoever should once make my soul lose her footing would never set her upright again she retastes and research herself too profoundly and too much to the quick and therefore would never let the wound she have receive heal and cicatrise it have be well for me that no sickness have yet discompose her at every charge make upon me i preserve my utmost opposition and defence by which mean the first that should rout me would keep me from ever rally again i have no aftergame to play on which side soever the inundation break my bank i lie open and be drown without remedy epicurus say that a wise man can never become a fool i have an opinion reverse to this sentence which be that he who have once be a very fool will never after be very wise god grant me cold accord to my cloth and passion proportionable to the mean i have to withstand them nature have lay me open on the one side have cover me on the other have disarm me of strength she have arm me with insensibility and an apprehension that be regular or if you will dull i can not now long endure and when i be young could much less either coach litter or boat and hate all other rid but on horseback both in town and country but i can bear a litter bad than a coach and by the same reason a rough agitation upon the water whence fear be produce good than the motion of a calm at the little jerk of oar steal the vessel from under u i find i know not how both my head and my stomach disorder neithercan i endure to sit upon a totter chair when the sail or the current carry u equally or that we be tow the equal agitation do not disturb me at all ti an interrupted motion that offend me and most of all when most slow i can not otherwise express it the physician have order me to squeeze and gird myself about the bottom of the belly with a napkin to remedy this evil which however i have not try be accustom to wrestle with my own defect and overcome them myself would my memory serve me i should not think my time ill spend in set down here the infinite variety that history present u of the use of chariot in the service of war various accord to the nation and accord to the age in my opinion of great necessity and effect so that it be a wonder that we have lose all knowledge of them i will only say this that very lately in our father time the hungarian make very advantageous use of them against the turk have in every one of them a targetter and a musketeer and a number of harquebus pile ready and loaded and all cover with a pavesade like a galliot they form the front of their battle with three thousand such coach and after the cannon have play make them all pour in their shot upon the enemy who have to swallow that volley before they taste of the rest which be no little advance and that do these chariot charge into their squadron to break them and open a way for the rest besides the use they might make of them to flank the soldier in a place of danger when march to the field or to cover a post and fortify it in haste in my time a gentleman on one of our frontier unwieldy of body and find no horse able to carry hi weight have a quarrel rode through the country in a chariot of this fashion and find great convenience in it but let u leave these chariot of war a if their effeminacy have not be sufficiently know by good proof the last king of our first race travel in a chariot draw by four ox marc antony be the first at rome who cause himself to be draw in a coach by lion and a singing wench with him heliogabalus do since a much call himself cybele the mother of the god and also draw by tiger take upon him the person of the god bacchus he also sometimes harness two stag to hi coach another time four dog and another four naked wench cause himself to be draw by them in pomp stark naked too the emperor firmus cause hi chariot to be draw by ostrich of a prodigious size so that it seem rather to fly than roll the strangeness of these invention put this other fancy in my head that it be a kind of pusillanimity in monarch and a testimony that they do not sufficiently understand themselves what they be when they study to make themselves honour and to appear great by excessive expense it be indeed excusable in a foreign country but amongst their own subject where they be in sovereign command and may do what they please it derogate from their dignity the most supreme degree of honour to which they can arrive just a methinks it be superfluous in a private gentleman to go finely dress at home hi house hi attendant and hi kitchen sufficiently answer for him the advice that isocrates give hi king seem to be ground upon reason that he should be splendid in plate and furniture forasmuch a it be an expense of duration that devolve on hi successor and that he should avoid all magnificence that will in a short time be forget i love to go fine when i be a young brother for want of other ornament and it become me well there be some upon whom their rich clothes weep we have strange story of the frugality of our king about their own person and in their gift king who be great in reputation valour and fortune demosthenes vehemently oppose the law of hi city that assign the public money for the pomp of their public play and festival he would that their greatness should be see in number of ship well equipped and good army well provide for and there be good reason to condemn theophrastus who in hi book on rich establish a contrary opinion and maintain that sort of expense to be the true fruit of abundance they be delight say aristotle that a only please the baser sort of the people and that vanish from the memory as soon a the people be sate with them and for which no serious and judicious man can have any esteem this money would in my opinion be much more royally a more profitably justly and durably lay out in port haven wall and fortification in sumptuous building church hospital colleges the reforming of street and highway wherein pope gregory xiii will leave a laudable memory to future time and wherein our queen catherine would to long posterity manifest her natural liberality and munificence do her mean supply her affection fortune have do me a great despite in interrupt the noble structure of the pontneuf of our great city and deprive me of the hope of see it finish before i die moreover it seem to subject who be spectator of these triumph that their own rich be expose before them and that they be entertain at their own expense for the people be apt to presume of king a we do of our servant that they be to take care to provide u all thing necessary in abundance but not touch it themselves and therefore the emperor galba be please with a musician who play to him at supper call for hi moneybox and give him a handful of crown that he take out of it with these word this be not the public money but my own yet it so fall out that the people for the most part have reason on their side and that the prince fee their eye with what they have need of to fill their belly liberality itself be not in it true lustre in a sovereign hand private men have therein the most right for to take it exactly a king have nothing properly hi own he owe himself to other authority be not give in favour of the magistrate but of the people a superior be never make so for hi own profit but for the profit of the inferior and a physician for the sick person and not for himself all magistracy as well a all art have it end out of itself wherefore the tutor of young prince who make it their business to imprint in them this virtue of liberality and preach to them to deny nothing and to think nothing so well spent a what they give a doctrine that i have know in great credit in my time either have more particular regard to their own profit than to that of their master or ill understand to whom they speak it be too easy a thing to inculcate liberality on him who have as much a he will to practise it with at the expense of other and the estimate not be proportion to the measure of the gift but to the measure of the mean of him who give it it come to nothing in so mighty hand they find themselves prodigal before they can be repute liberal and it be but a little recommendation in comparison with other royal virtue and the only one a the tyrant dionysius say that suit well with tyranny itself i should rather teach him this verse of the ancient labourer he must scatter it abroad and not lay it on a heap in one place and that see he be to give or to say good to pay and restore to so many people accord a they have deserve he ought to be a loyal and discreet disposer if the liberality of a prince be without measure or discretion i have rather he be covetous royal virtue seem most to consist in justice and of all the part of justice that best denote a king which accompany liberality for this they have particularly reserve to be perform by themselves whereas all other sort of justice they remit to the administration of other an immoderate bounty be a very weak mean to acquire for them good will it check more people than it allure and if it be confer without due respect of merit it put him out of countenance who receive it and be receive ungraciously tyrant have be sacrifice to the hatred of the people by the hand of those very men they have unjustly advance such kind of men a buffoon pander fiddler and such ragamuffin think to assure to themselves the possession of benefit unduly receive if they manifest to have him in hatred and disdain of whom they hold them and in this associate themselves to the common judgment and opinion the subject of a prince excessive in gift grow excessive in ask and regulate their demand not by reason but by example we have seriously very often reason to blush at our own impudence we be overpaid accord to justice when the recompense equal our service for do we owe nothing of natural obligation to our prince if he bear our charge he do too much ti enough that he contribute to them the overplus be call benefit which can not be exact for the very name liberality sound of liberty in our fashion it be never do we never reckon what we have receive we be only for the future liberality wherefore the more a prince exhaust himself in give the poorer he grow in friend how should he satisfy immoderate desire that still increase a they be fulfil he who have hi thought upon take never think of what he have take covetousness have nothing so properly and so much it own a ingratitude the example of cyrus will not do amiss in this place to serve the king of these time for a touchstone to know whether their gift be well or ill bestow and to see how much good that emperor confer them than they do by which mean they be reduce to borrow of unknown subject and rather of them whom they have wrong than of them on whom they have confer their benefit and so receive aid wherein there be nothing of gratuitous but the name croesus reproach him with hi bounty and cast up to how much hi treasure would amount if he have be a little closerhanded he have a mind to justify hi liberality and therefore send despatch into all part to the grandee of hi dominion whom he have particularly advanced entreat every one of them to supply him with as much money a they could for a pressing occasion and to send him particular of what each could advance when all these answer be bring to him every one of hi friend not think it enough barely to offer him so much a he have receive from hi bounty and add to it a great deal of hi own it appear that the sum amount to a great deal more than croesus reckon whereupon cyrus i be not say he less in love with rich than other prince but rather a good husband you see with how small a venture i have acquire the inestimable treasure of so many friend and how much more faithful treasurer they be to me than mercenary men without obligation without affection and my money better lay up than in chest bring upon me the hatred envy and contempt of other prince the emperor excuse the superfluity of their play and public spectacle by reason that their authority in some sort at least in outward appearance depend upon the will of the people of rome who time out of mind have be accustom to be entertain and caress with such show and excess but they be private citizen who have nourish this custom to gratify their fellowcitizens and companion and chiefly out of their own purse by such profusion and magnificence it have quite another taste when the master come to imitate it philip see that hi son go about by present to gain the affection of the macedonian reprimand him in a letter after this manner what hast thou a mind that thy subject shall look upon thee a their cashkeeper and not a their king wilt thou tamper with them to win their affection do it then by the benefit of thy virtue and not by those of thy chest and yet it be doubtless a fine thing to bring and plant within the amphitheatre a great number of vast tree with all their branch in their full verdure represent a great shady forest dispose in excellent order and the first day to throw into it a thousand ostrich and a thousand stag a thousand boar and a thousand fallowdeer to be kill and dispose of by the people the next day to cause a hundred great lion a hundred leopard and three hundred bear to be kill in hi presence and for the third day to make three hundred pair of gladiator fight it out to the last a the emperor probus do it be also very fine to see those vast amphitheatre all face with marble without curiously work with figure and statue and within glitter with rare enrichment all the side of this vast space fill and environ from the bottom to the top with three or four score row of seat all of marble also and cover with cushion where a hundred thousand men might sit at their ease and the place below where the game be play to make it by art first open and cleave in chasm represent cave that vomit out the beast design for the spectacle and then secondly to be overflow by a deep sea full of sea monster and laden with ship of war to represent a naval battle and thirdly to make it dry and even again for the combat of the gladiator and for the fourth scene to have it strown with vermilion grain and storax instead of sand there to make a solemn feast for all that infinite number of people the last act of one only day sometimes they make a high mountain advance itself cover with fruittrees and other leafy tree send down rivulet of water from the top a from the mouth of a fountain otherwhiles a great ship be see to come rolling in which open and divide of itself and after have disgorge from the hold four or five hundred beast for fight close again and vanish without help at other time from the floor of this place they make spout of perfumed water dart their stream upward and so high a to sprinkle all that infinite multitude to defend themselves from the injury of the weather they have that vast place one while cover over with purple curtain of needlework and byandby with silk of one or another colour which they draw off or on in a moment a they have a mind the network also that be set before the people to defend them from the violence of these turnedout beast be weave of gold if there be anything excusable in such excess a these it be where the novelty and invention create more wonder than the expense even in these vanity we discover how fertile those age be in other kind of wit than these of ours it be with this sort of fertility a with all other product of nature not that she there and then employ her utmost force we do not go we rather run up and down and whirl this way and that we turn back the way we come i be afraid our knowledge be weak in all sens we neither see far forward nor far backward our understand comprehends little and live but a little while ti short both in extent of time and extent of matter and the narrative of solon of what he have learn from the egyptian priest touch the long life of their state and their manner of learning and preserve foreign history be not methinks a testimony to be refuse in this consideration though all that have arrive by report of our knowledge of time past should be true and know by some one person it would be less than nothing in comparison of what be unknown and of this same image of the world which glide away whilst we live upon it how wretched and limited be the knowledge of the most curious not only of particular event which fortune often render exemplary and of great concern but of the state of great government and nation a hundred more escape u than ever come to our knowledge we make a mighty business of the invention of artillery and printing which other men at the other end of the world in china have a thousand year ago did we but see a much of the world a we do not see we should perceive we may well believe a perpetual multiplication and vicissitude of form there be nothing single and rare in respect of nature but in respect of our knowledge which be a wretched foundation whereon to grind our rule and that represent to u a very false image of thing a we nowadays vainly conclude the declension and decrepitude of the world by the argument we extract from our own weakness and decay so do he vainly conclude a to it birth and youth by the vigour he observe in the wit of hi time abound in novelty and the invention of diver art our world have lately discover another and who will assure u that it be the last of it brother since the daemon the sybils and we ourselves have be ignorant of this till now a large wellpeopled and fruitful a this whereon we live and yet so raw and childish that we be still teach it it a b c ti not above fifty year since it know neither letter weight measure vestment corn nor vine it be then quite naked in the mother lap and only live upon what she give it if we rightly conclude of our end and this poet of the youthfulness of that age of hi that other world will only enter into the light when this of ours shall make it exit the universe will fall into paralysis one member will be useless the other in vigour i be very much afraid that we have greatly precipitate it declension and ruin by our contagion and that we have sell it opinion and our art at a very dear rate it be an infant world and yet we have not whip and subject it to our discipline by the advantage of our natural worth and force neither have we win it by our justice and goodness nor subdue it by our magnanimity most of their answer and the negotiation we have have with them witness that they be nothing behind u in pertinency and clearness of natural understand the astonishing magnificence of the city of cusco and mexico and amongst many other thing the garden of the king where all the tree fruit and plant accord to the order and stature they have in a garden be excellently form in gold a in hi cabinet be all the animal breed upon hi territory and in it sea and the beauty of their manufacture in jewel feather cotton and painting give ample proof that they be as little inferior to u in industry but a to what concern devotion observance of the law goodness liberality loyalty and plain deal it be of use to u that we have not so much a they for they have lose sell and betray themselves by this advantage over u a to boldness and courage stability constancy against pain hunger and death i should not fear to oppose the example i find amongst them to the most famous example of elder time that we find in our record on this side of the world far a to those who subdue them take but away the trick and artifice they practise to gull them and the just astonishment it be to those nation to see so sudden and unexpected an arrival of men with beard differ in language religion shape and countenance from so remote a part of the world and where they have never hear there be any habitation mount upon great unknown monster against those who have not only never see a horse but have never see any other beast train up to carry a man or any other loading shell in a hard and shin skin with a cutting and glitter weapon in hi hand against them who out of wonder at the brightness of a look glass or a knife would exchange great treasure of gold and pearl and who have neither knowledge nor matter with which at leisure they could penetrate our steel to which may be add the lightning and thunder of our cannon and harquebuses enough to frighten caesar himself if surprise with so little experience against people naked except where the invention of a little quilted cotton be in use without other arm at the most than bow stone stave and buckler of wood people surprise under colour of friendship and good faith by the curiosity of see strange and unknown thing take but away i say this disparity from the conqueror and you take away all the occasion of so many victory when i look upon that in vincible ardour wherewith so many thousand of men woman and child so often present and threw themselves into inevitable danger for the defence of their god and liberty that generous obstinacy to suffer all extremity and difficulty and death itself rather than submit to the dominion of those by whom they have be so shamefully abuse and some of them choose to die of hunger and fast be prisoner rather than to accept of nourishment from the hand of their so basely victorious enemy i see that whoever would have attack them upon equal term of arm experience and number would have have a hard and peradventure a harder game to play than in any other war we have see why do not so noble a conquest fall under alexander or the ancient greek and roman and so great a revolution and mutation of so many empire and nation fall into hand that would have gently level root up and make plain and smooth whatever be rough and savage amongst them and that would have cherish and propagate the good seed that nature have there produce mix not only with the culture of land and the ornament of city the art of this part of the world in what be necessary but also the greek and roman virtue with those that be original of the country what a reparation have it be to them and what a general good to the whole world have our first example and deportment in those part allure those people to the admiration and imitation of virtue and have beget betwixt them and u a fraternal society and intelligence how easy have it be to have make advantage of soul so innocent and so eager to learn leave for the most part naturally so good inclination before whereas on the contrary we have take advantage of their ignorance and inexperience with great ease to incline them to treachery luxury avarice and towards all sort of inhumanity and cruelty by the pattern and example of our manner who ever enhance the price of merchandise at such a rate so many city level with the ground so many nation exterminate so many million of people fall by the edge of the sword and the rich and most beautiful part of the world turn upside down for the traffic of pearl and pepper mechanic victory never do ambition never do public animosity engage men against one another in such miserable hostility in such miserable calamity certain spaniard coast the sea in quest of their mine land in a fruitful and pleasant and very well peopled country and there make to the inhabitant their accustomed profession that they be peaceable men who be come from a very remote country and send on the behalf of the king of castile the great prince of the habitable world to whom the pope god vicegerent upon earth have give the principality of all the indie that if they would become tributary to him they should be very gently and courteously use at the same time requiring of them victual for their nourishment and gold whereof to make some pretended medicine set forth moreover the belief in one only god and the truth of our religion which they advise them to embrace whereunto they also add some threat to which they receive this answer that a to their be peaceable they do not seem to be such if they be so a to their king since he be fain to beg he must be necessitous and poor and he who have make him this gift must be a man who love dissension to give that to another which be none of hi own to bring it into dispute against the ancient possessor a to victual they would supply them that of gold they have little it be a thing they have in very small esteem a of no use to the service of life whereas their only care be to pass it over happily and pleasantly but that what they could find except what be employ in the service of their god they might freely take a to one only god the proposition have please them well but that they would not change their religion both because they have so long and happily live in it and that they be not wont to take advice of any but their friend and those they know a to their menace it be a sign of want of judgment to threaten those whose nature and power be to them unknown that therefore they be to make haste to quit their coast for they be not use to take the civility and profession of arm men and stranger in good part otherwise they should do by them a they have do by those other show them the head of several execute men round the wall of their city a fair example of the babble of these child but so it be that the spaniard do not either in this or in several other place where they do not find the merchandise they seek make any stay or attempt whatever other convenience be there to be have witness my cannibal of the two most puissant monarch of that world and peradventure of this king of so many king and the last they turn out he of peru have be take in a battle and put to so excessive a ransom a exceeds all belief and it be faithfully pay and he have by hi conversation give manifest sign of a frank liberal and constant spirit and of a clear and settle understand the conqueror have a mind after have exact one million three hundred and twentyfive thousand and five hundred weight of gold besides silver and other thing which amount to no less so that their horse be shod with massy gold still to see at the price of what disloyalty and injustice whatever what the remainder of the treasure of this king might be and to possess themselves of that also to this end a false accusation be prefer against him and false witness bring to prove that he go about to raise an insurrection in hi province to procure hi own liberty whereupon by the virtuous sentence of those very men who have by this treachery conspire hi ruin he be condemn to be publicly hang and strangle after have make him buy off the torment of be burnt alive by the baptism they give him immediately before execution a horrid and unheard of barbarity which nevertheless he undergo without give way either in word or look with a truly grave and royal behaviour after which to calm and appease the people arouse and astound at so strange a thing they counterfeit great sorrow for hi death and appoint most sumptuous funeral the other king of mexico have for a long time defend hi beleaguered city and have in this siege manifest the utmost of what suffering and perseverance can do if ever prince and people do and hi misfortune have deliver him alive into hi enemy hand upon article of be treat like a king neither do he in hi captivity discover anything unworthy of that title hi enemy after their victory not find so much gold a they expect when they have search and rifle with their utmost diligence they go about to procure discovery by the most cruel torment they could invent upon the prisoner they have take but have profit nothing by these their courage be great than their torment they arrive at last to such a degree of fury a contrary to their faith and the law of nation to condemn the king himself and one of the principal nobleman of hi court to the rack in the presence of one another this lord find himself overcome with pain be environ with burning coal pitifully turn hi die eye towards hi master a it be to ask him pardon that he be able to endure no more whereupon the king darting at him a fierce and severe look a reproach hi cowardice and pusillanimity with a harsh and constant voice say to him thus only and what dost thou think i suffer be i in a bath be i more at ease than thou whereupon the other immediately quail under the torment and die upon the spot the king half roast be carry thence not so much out of pity for what compassion ever touch so barbarous soul who upon the doubtful information of some vessel of gold to be make a prey of cause not only a man but a king so great in fortune and desert to be broil before their eye but because hi constancy render their cruelty still more shameful they afterwards hang him for have nobly attempt to deliver himself by arm from so long a captivity and subjection and he die with a courage become so magnanimous a prince another time they burn in the same fire four hundred and sixty men alive at once the four hundred of the common people the sixty the principal lord of a province simply prisoner of war we have these narrative from themselves for they not only own it but boast of it and publish it could it be for a testimony of their justice or their zeal to religion doubtless these be way too differ and contrary to so holy an end have they propose to themselves to extend our faith they would have consider that it do not amplify in the possession of territory but in the gaining of men and would have more than satisfied themselves with the slaughter occasion by the necessity of war without indifferently mix a massacre a upon wild beast as universal a fire and sword could make it have only by intention save so many a they mean to make miserable slave of for the work and service of their mine so that many of the captain be put to death upon the place of conquest by order of the king of castile justly offend with the horror of their deportment and almost all of them hat and disesteem god meritoriously permit that all this great plunder should be swallow up by the sea in transportation or in the civil war wherewith they devour one another and most of the men themselves be bury in a foreign land without any fruit of their victory that the revenue from these country though in the hand of so parsimonious and so prudent a prince so little answer the expectation give of it to hi predecessor and to that original abundance of rich which be find at the first landing in those new discovered country for though a great deal be fetch thence yet we see tis nothing in comparison of that which might be expect be that the use of coin be there utterly unknown and that consequently their gold be find all hoard together be of no other use but for ornament and show a a furniture reserve from father to son by many puissant king who be ever drain their mine to make this vast heap of vessel and statue for the decoration of their palace and temple whereas our gold be always in motion and traffic we cut it into a thousand small piece and cast it into a thousand form and scatter and disperse it in a thousand way but suppose our king should thus hoard up all the gold they could get in several age and let it lie idle by them those of the kingdom of mexico be in some sort more civilised and more advanced in art than the other nation about them therefore do they judge a we do that the world be near it period and look upon the desolation we bring amongst them a a certain sign of it they believe that the existence of the world be divide into five age and in the life of five successive sun of which four have already end their time and that this which give them light be the fifth the first perish with all other creature by an universal inundation of water the second by the heaven fall upon u and suffocate every live thing to which age they assign the giant and show bone to the spaniard accord to the proportion of which the stature of men amount to twenty foot the third by fire which burn and consume all the fourth by an emotion of the air and wind which come with such violence a to beat down even many mountain wherein the men die not but be turn into baboon what impression will not the weakness of human belief admit after the death of this fourth sun the world be twentyfive year in perpetual darkness in the fifteenth of which a man and a woman be create who restore the human race ten year after upon a certain day the sun appear newly create and since the account of their year take begin from that day the third day after it creation the ancient god die and the new one be since bear daily after what manner they think this last sun shall perish my author know not but their number of this fourth change agree with the great conjunction of star which eight hundred and odd year ago a astrologer suppose produce great alteration and novelty in the world a to pomp and magnificence upon the account of which i engage in this discourse neither greece rome nor egypt whether for utility difficulty or state can compare any of their work with the highway to be see in peru make by the king of the country from the city of quito to that of cusco three hundred league straight even fiveandtwenty pace wide pave and provide on both side with high and beautiful wall and close by them and all along on the inside two perennial stream border with beautiful plant which they call moly in this work where they meet with rock and mountain they cut them through and make them even and fill up pit and valley with lime and stone to make them level at the end of every day journey be beautiful palace furnish with provision vestment and arm as well for traveller a for the army that be to pass that way in the estimate of this work i have reckon the difficulty which be especially considerable in that place they do not build with any stone less than ten foot square and have no other conveniency of carriage but by draw their load themselves by force of arm and know not so much a the art of scaffold nor any other way of stand to their work but by throw up earth against the building a it rise higher take it away again when they have do let u here return to our coach instead of these and of all other sort of carriage they cause themselves to be carry upon men shoulder this last king of peru the day that he be take be thus carry betwixt two upon stave of gold and set in a chair of gold in the middle of hi army a many of these sedanmen a be kill to make him fall for they would take him alive so many other and they contend for it take the place of those who be slay so that they could never beat him down what slaughter soever they make of these people till a horseman seize upon him bring him to the ground since we can not attain unto it let u revenge our self by rail at it and yet it be not absolutely rail against anything to proclaim it defect because they be in all thing to be find how beautiful or how much to be covet soever greatness have in general this manifest advantage that it can lower itself when it please and have very near the choice of both the one and the other condition for a man do not fall from all height there be several from which one may descend without fall down it do indeed appear to me that we value it at too high a rate and also overvalue the resolution of those whom we have either see or hear have contemn it or displace themselves of their own accord it essence be not so evidently commodious that a man may not with out a miracle refuse it i find it a very hard thing to undergo misfortune but to be content with a moderate measure of fortune and to avoid greatness i think a very easy matter ti methinks a virtue to which i who be no conjuror could without any great endeavour arrive what then be to be expect from them that would yet put into consideration the glory attend this refusal wherein there may lurk bad ambition than even in the desire itself and fruition of greatness forasmuch a ambition never comport itself good accord to itself than when it proceed by obscure and unfrequented way i incite my courage to patience but i rein it as much a i can towards desire i have as much to wish for a another and allow my wish a much liberty and indiscretion but yet it never befall me to wish for either empire or royalty or the eminency of those high and commanding fortune i do not aim that way i love myself too well when i think to grow great ti but very moderately and by a compelled and timorous advancement such a be proper for me in resolution in prudence in health in beauty and even in rich too but this supreme reputation this mighty authority oppress my imagination and quite contrary to that other i should peradventure rather choose to be the second or third in perigord than the first at paris at least without lie rather the third at paris than the first i would neither dispute with a porter a miserable unknown nor make crowd open in adoration a i pass i be train up to a moderate condition a well by my choice a fortune and have make it appear in the whole conduct of my life and enterprises that i have rather avoid than otherwise the climbing above the degree of fortune wherein god have place me by my birth all natural constitution be equally just and easy my soul be such a poltroon that i measure not good fortune by the height but by the facility but if my heart be not great enough ti open enough to make amends at any one request freely to lay open it weakness should any one put me upon compare the life of l thorius balbus a brave man handsome learn healthful understanding and abound in all sort of convenience and pleasure lead a quiet life and all hi own hi mind well prepared against death superstition pain and other incumbrance of human necessity die at last in battle with hi sword in hi hand for the defence of hi country on the one part and on the other part the life of m regulus so great and high a be know to every one and hi end admirable the one without name and without dignity the other exemplary and glorious to a wonder i should doubtless say a cicero do could i speak as well a he but if i be to compare them with my own i should then also say that the first be as much accord to my capacity and from desire which i conform to my capacity a the second be far beyond it that i could not approach the last but with veneration the other i could readily attain by use let u return to our temporal greatness from which we be digress i disrelish all dominion whether active or passive otanes one of the seven who have right to pretend to the kingdom of persia do a i should willingly have do which be that he give up to hi competitor hi right of be promote to it either by election or by lot provide that he and hi might live in the empire out of all authority and subjection those of the ancient law except and might enjoy all liberty that be not prejudicial to these be a impatient of command a of be command the most painful and difficult employment in the world in my opinion be worthily to discharge the office of a king i excuse more of their mistake than men commonly do in consideration of the intolerable weight of their function which astound me ti hard to keep measure in so immeasurable a power yet so it be that it be even to those who be not of the best nature a singular incitement to virtue to be seat in a place where you can not do the least good that shall not be put upon record and where the least benefit redounds to so many men and where your talent of administration like that of preacher principally address itself to the people no very exact judge easy to deceive and easily content there be few thing wherein we can give a sincere judgment by reason that there be few wherein we have not in some sort a private interest superiority and inferiority dominion and subjection be bind to a natural envy and contest and must of necessity perpetually intrench upon one another i believe neither the one nor the other touch the right of the other party let reason therefore which be inflexible and without passion determine when we can avail ourselves of it ti not above a month ago that i read over two scottish author contend upon this subject of whom he who stand for the people make the king to be in a bad condition than a carter he who write for monarchy place him some degree above god in power and sovereignty now the incommodity of greatness that i have take to remark in this place upon some occasion that have lately put it into my head be this there be not peradventure anything more pleasant in the commerce of many than the trial that we make against one another out of emulation of honour and worth whether in the exercise of the body or in those of the mind wherein sovereign greatness can have no true part and in earnest i have often think that by force of respect itself men use prince disdainfully and injuriously in that particular for the thing i be infinitely offend at in my childhood that they who exercise with me forbear to do their best because they find me unworthy of their utmost endeavour be what we see happen to them daily every one find himself unworthy to contend with them if we discover that they have the least desire to get the good of u there be no one who will not make it hi business to give it them and who will not rather betray hi own glory than offend theirs and will therein employ so much force only as be necessary to save their honour what share have they then in the engagement where every one be on their side methinks i see those paladin of ancient time present themselves to joust and battle with enchanted arm and body brisson run against alexander purposely miss hi blow and make a fault in hi career alexander chide him for it but he ought to have have him whip upon this consideration carneades say that the son of prince learn nothing right but to manage horse by reason that in all their other exercise every one bend and yield to them but a horse that be neither a flatterer nor a courtier throw the son of a king with no more ceremony than he would throw that of a porter homer be fain to consent that venus so sweet and delicate a goddess a she be should be wound at the battle of troy thereby to ascribe courage and boldness to her quality that can not possibly be in those who be exempt from danger the god be make to be angry to fear to run away to be jealous to grieve to be transport with passion to honour them with the virtue that amongst u be build upon these imperfection who do not participate in the hazard and difficulty can claim no interest in the honour and pleasure that be the consequents of hazardous action ti pity a man should be so potent that all thing must give way to him fortune therein set you too remote from society and place you in too great a solitude this easiness and mean facility of make all thing bow under you be an enemy to all sort of pleasure ti to slide not to go ti to sleep and not to live conceive man accompany with omnipotence you overwhelm him he must beg disturbance and opposition a an alms hi be and hi good be in indigence evil to man be in it turn good and good evil neither be pain always to be shun nor pleasure always to be pursue their good quality be dead and lose for they can only be perceive by comparison and we put them out of this they have little knowledge of true praise have their ear deafen with so continual and uniform an approbation have they to do with the stupid of all their subject they have no mean to take any advantage of him if he but say ti because he be my king he think he have say enough to express that he therefore suffer himself to be overcome this quality stifle and consume the other true and essential quality they be sink in the royalty and leave them nothing to recommend themselves with but action that directly concern and serve the function of their place ti so much to be a king that this alone remain to them the outer glare that environ him conceals and shroud him from u our sight be there repel and dissipate be fill and stop by this prevailing light the senate award the prize of eloquence to tiberius he refuse it esteem that though it have be just he could derive no advantage from a judgment so partial and that be so little free to judge a we give them all advantage of honour so do we soothe and authorise all their vice and defect not only by approbation but by imitation also every one of alexander follower carry hi head on one side a he do and the flatterer of dionysius run against one another in hi presence and stumble at and overturn whatever be under foot to shew they be as purblind a he hernia itself have also serve to recommend a man to favour i have see deafness affect and because the master hat hi wife plutarch have see hi courtier repudiate theirs whom they love and which be yet more uncleanliness and all manner of dissoluteness have so be in fashion a also disloyalty blasphemy cruelty heresy superstition irreligion effeminacy and bad if bad there be and by an example yet more dangerous than that of mithridates flatterer who a their master pretend to the honour of a good physician come to him to have incision and cautery make in their limb for these other suffer the soul a more delicate and noble part to be cauterise but to end where i begin the emperor adrian dispute with the philosopher favorinus about the interpretation of some word favorinus soon yield him the victory for which hi friend rebuke him you talk simply say he would you not have him wise than i who command thirty legion augustus write verse against asinius pollio and i say pollio say nothing for it be not prudence to write in contest with him who have power to proscribe and they be right for dionysius because he could not equal philoxenus in poesy and plato in discourse condemn the one to the quarry and send the other to be sell for a slave into the island of aegina ti a custom of our justice to condemn some for a warning to other to condemn them for have do amiss be folly a plato say for what be do can never be undone but ti to the end they may offend no more and that other may avoid the example of their offence we do not correct the man we hang we correct other by him i do the same my error be sometimes natural incorrigible and irremediable but the good which virtuous men do to the public in make themselves imitated i peradventure may do in make my manner avoid publishing and accuse my own imperfection some one will learn to be afraid of them the part that i most esteem in myself derive more honour from decry than for commend myself which be the reason why i so often fall into and so much insist upon that strain but when all be sum up a man never speak of himself without loss a mans accusation of himself be always believe hi praise never there may peradventure be some of my own complexion who well instruct myself by contrariety than by similitude and by avoid than by imitation the elder cato be regard this sort of discipline when he say that the wise may learn more of fool than fool can of the wise and pausanias tell u of an ancient player upon the harp who be wont to make hi scholar go to hear one who play very ill who live over against him that they might learn to hate hi discord and false measure the horror of cruelty more incline me to clemency than any example of clemency could possibly do a good rider do not so much mend my seat a an awkward attorney or a venetian on horseback and a clownish way of speak more reform mine than the most correct the ridiculous and simple look of another always warn and advise me that which prick rous and incites much good than that which tickle the time be now proper for u to reform backward more by dissent than by agree by differ more than by consent profit little by good example i make use of those that be ill which be everywhere to be find i endeavour to render myself as agreeable a i see other offensive as constant a i see other fickle as affable a i see other rough as good a i see other evil but i propose to myself impracticable measure the most fruitful and natural exercise of the mind in my opinion be conversation i find the use of it more sweet than of any other action of life and for that reason it be that if i be now compel to choose i should sooner i think consent to lose my sight than my hearing and speech the athenian and also the roman keep this exercise in great honour in their academy the italian retain some trace of it to this day to their great advantage a be manifest by the comparison of our understanding with theirs the study of book be a languishing and feeble motion that heat not whereas conversation teach and exercise at once if i converse with a strong mind and a rough disputant he press upon my flank and prick me right and leave hi imagination stir up mine jealousy glory and contention stimulate and raise me up to something above myself and acquiescence be a quality altogether tedious in discourse but a our mind fortifies itself by the communication of vigorous and regular understanding ti not to be express how much it lose and degenerate by the continual commerce and familiarity we have with mean and weak spirit there be no contagion that spread like that i know sufficiently by experience what tis worth a yard i love to discourse and dispute but it be with but few men and for myself for to do it a a spectacle and entertainment to great person and to make of a man wit and word competitive parade be in my opinion very unbecoming a man of honour folly be a bad quality but not to be able to endure it to fret and vex at it a i do be another sort of disease little less troublesome than folly itself and be the thing that i will now accuse in myself i enter into conference and dispute with great liberty and facility forasmuch a opinion meet in me with a soil very unfit for penetration and wherein to take any deep root no proposition astonish me no belief offend me though never so contrary to my own there be no so frivolous and extravagant fancy that do not seem to me suitable to the production of human wit we who deprive our judgment of the right of determine look indifferently upon the diverse opinion and if we incline not our judgment to them yet we easily give them the hearing where one scale be totally empty i let the other waver under an old wife dream and i think myself excusable if i prefer the odd number thursday rather than friday if i have rather be the twelfth or fourteenth than the thirteenth at table if i have rather on a journey see a hare run by me than cross my way and rather give my man my left foot than my right when he come to put on my stocking all such revery a be in credit around u deserve at least a hearing for my part they only with me import inanity but they import that moreover vulgar and casual opinion be something more than nothing in nature and he who will not suffer himself to proceed so far fall peradventure into the vice of obstinacy to avoid that of superstition the contradiction of judgment then neither offend nor alter they only rouse and exercise me we evade correction whereas we ought to offer and present ourselves to it especially when it appear in the form of conference and not of authority at every opposition we do not consider whether or no it be dust but right or wrong how to disengage ourselves instead of extend the arm we thrust out our claw i could suffer myself to be rudely handle by my friend so much a to tell me that i be a fool and talk i know not of what i love stout expression amongst gentle men and to have them speak a they think we must fortify and harden our hear against this tenderness of the ceremonious sound of word i love a strong and manly familiarity and conversation a friendship that please itself in the sharpness and vigour of it communication like love in biting and scratch it be not vigorous and generous enough if it be not quarrelsome if it be civilise and artificial if it tread nicely and fear the shock when any one contradicts me he raise my attention not my anger i advance towards him who controvert who instruct me the cause of truth ought to be the common cause both of the one and the other what will the angry man answer passion have already confound hi judgment agitation have usurp the place of reason it be not amiss that the decision of our dispute should pass by wager that there might be a material mark of our loss to the end we might the good remember them and that my man might tell me your ignorance and obstinacy cost you last year at several time a hundred crown i hail and caress truth in what quarter soever i find it and cheerfully surrender myself and open my conquered arm a far off a i can discover it and provide it be not too imperiously take a pleasure in be reprove and accommodate myself to my accuser very often more by reason of civility than amendment love to gratify and nourish the liberty of admonition by my facility of submit to it and this even at my own expense nevertheless it be hard to bring the men of my time to it they have not the courage to correct because they have not the courage to suffer themselves to be correct and speak always with dissimulation in the presence of one another i take so great a pleasure in be judge and know that it be almost indifferent to me in which of the two form i be so my imagination so often contradicts and condemn itself that ti all one to me if another do it especially consider that i give hi reprehension no great authority than i choose but i break with him who carry himself so high a i know of one who repent hi advice if not believe and take it for an affront if it be not immediately follow that socrates always receive smilingly the contradiction offer to hi argument a man may say arose from hi strength of reason and that the advantage be certain to fall on hi side he accept them a a matter of new victory but we see on the contrary that nothing in argument render our sentiment so delicate a the opinion of preeminence and disdain of the adversary and that in reason ti rather for the weak to take in good part the opposition that correct him and set him right in earnest i rather choose the company of those who ruffle me than of those who fear me ti a dull and hurtful pleasure to have to do with people who admire u and approve of all we say antisthenes command hi child never to take it kindly or for a favour when any man commend them i find i be much prouder of the victory i obtain over myself when in the very ardour of dispute i make myself submit to my adversarys force of reason than i be pleased with the victory i obtain over him through hi weakness in fine i receive and admit of all manner of attack that be direct how weak soever but i be too impatient of those that be make out of form i care not what the subject be the opinion be to me all one and i be almost indifferent whether i get the good or the bad i can peaceably argue a whole day together if the argument be carry on with method i do not so much require force and subtlety a order i mean the order which we every day observe in the wrangling of shepherd and shopboys but never amongst u if they start from their subject ti out of incivility and so tis with u but their tumult and impatience never put them out of their theme their argument still continue it course if they interrupt and do not stay for one another they at least understand one another any one answer too well for me if he answer what i say when the dispute be irregular and disorder i leave the thing itself and insist upon the form with anger and indiscretion fall into wilful malicious and imperious way of disputation of which i be afterwards ashamed ti impossible to deal fairly with a fool my judgment be not only corrupt under the hand of so impetuous a master but my conscience also our dispute ought to be interdict and punish as well a other verbal crime what vice do they not raise and heap up be always govern and command by passion we first quarrel with their reason and then with the men we only learn to dispute that we may contradict and so every one contradicting and be contradict it fall out that the fruit of disputation be to lose and annihilate truth therefore it be that plato in hi republic prohibits this exercise to fool and illbred people to what end do you go about to inquire of him who know nothing to the purpose a man do no injury to the subject when he leave it to seek how he may treat it i do not mean by an artificial and scholastic way but by a natural one with a sound understand what will it be in the end one fly to the east the other to the west they lose the principal disperse it in the crowd of incident after an hour of tempest they know not what they seek one be low the other high and a third wide one catch at a word and a simile another be no longer sensible of what be say in opposition to him and think only of go on at hi own rate not of answer you another find himself too weak to make good hi rest fear all refuse all at the very begin confound the subject or in the very height of the dispute stop short and be silent by a peevish ignorance affect a proud contempt or a foolishly modest avoidance of further debate provide this man strike he care not how much he lay himself open the other count hi word and weigh them for reason another only brawl and use the advantage of hi lung here one who learnedly conclude against himself and another who deafen you with preface and senseless digression an other fall into downright railing and seek a quarrel after the german fashion to disengage himself from a wit that press too hard upon him and a last man see nothing into the reason of the thing but draw a line of circumvallation about you of dialectic clause and the formula of hi art now who would not enter into distrust of science and doubt whether he can reap from them any solid fruit for the service of life consider the use we put them to who have get understanding by hi logic where be all her fair promise be there more noise or confusion in the scolding of herringwives than in the public dispute of men of this profession i have rather my son should learn in a taphouse to speak than in the school to prate take a master of art and confer with him why do he not make u sensible of this artificial excellence and why do he not captivate woman and ignoramus a we be with admiration at the steadiness of hi reason and the beauty of hi order why do he not sway and persuade u to what he will why do a man who have so much advantage in matter and treatment mix rail indiscretion and fury in hi disputation strip him of hi gown hi hood and hi latin let him not batter our ear with aristotle pure and simple you will take him for one of u or bad whilst they torment u with this complication and confusion of word it fare with them methinks a with juggler their dexterity impose upon our sens but do not at all work upon our belief this legerdemain except they perform nothing that be not very ordinary and mean for be the more learned they be none the le fool i love and honour knowledge as much a they that have it and in it true use tis the most noble and the great acquisition of men but in such a i speak of and the number of them be infinite who build their fundamental sufficiency and value upon it who appeal from their understanding to their memory and who can do nothing but by book i hate it if i dare to say so bad than stupidity in my country and in my time learn improves fortune enough but not mind if it meet with those that be dull and heavy it overcharge and suffocate them leave them a crude and undigested mass if airy and fine it purify clarifies and subtilise them even to exinanition ti a thing of almost indifferent quality a very useful accession to a wellborn soul but hurtful and pernicious to other or rather a thing of very precious use that will not suffer itself to be purchase at an under rate in the hand of some ti a sceptre in that of other a fools bauble but let u proceed what great victory do you expect than to make your enemy see and know that he be not able to encounter you when you get the good of your argument ti truth that win when you get the advantage of form and method ti then you who win i be of opinion that in plato and xenophon socrates dispute more in favour of the disputant than in favour of the dispute and more to instruct euthydemus and protagoras in the knowledge of their impertinence than in the impertinence of their art he take hold of the first subject like one who have a more profitable end than to explain it namely to clear the understanding that he take upon him to instruct and exercise to hunt after truth be properly our business and we be inexcusable if we carry on the chase impertinently and ill to fail of seize it be another thing for we be bear to inquire after truth it belong to a great power to possess it it be not a democritus say hid in the bottom of the deep but rather elevate to an infinite height in the divine knowledge the world be but a school of inquisition it be not who shall enter the ring but who shall run the best course he may as well play the fool who speak true a he who speak false for we be upon the manner not the matter of speak ti my humour as much to regard the form a the substance and the advocate as much a the cause a alcibiades order we should and every day pass away my time in read author without any consideration of their learn their manner be what i look after not their subject and just so do i hunt after the conversation of any eminent wit not that he may teach me but that i may know him and that know him if i think him worthy of imitation i may imitate him every man may speak truly but to speak methodically prudently and fully be a talent that few men have the falsity that proceed from ignorance do not offend me but the foppery of it i have break off several treaty that would have be of advantage to me by reason of the impertinent contestation of those with whom i treat i be not move once in a year at the fault of those over whom i have authority but upon the account of the ridiculous obstinacy of their allegation denial excuse we be every day go together by the ear they neither understand what be say nor why and answer accordingly tis enough to drive a man mad i never feel any hurt upon my head but when ti knock against another and more easily forgive the vice of my servant than their boldness importunity and folly let them do less provide they understand what they do you live in hope to warm their affection to your service but there be nothing to be have or to be expect from a stock but what if i take thing otherwise than they be perhaps i do and therefore it be that i accuse my own impatience and hold in the first place that it be equally vicious both in him that be in the right and in him that be in the wrong for ti always a tyrannic sourness not to endure a form contrary to one own and besides there can not in truth be a great more constant nor more irregular folly than to be move and angry at the folly of the world for it principally make u quarrel with ourselves and the old philosopher never want an occasion for hi tear whilst he consider himself miso one of the seven sage of a timonian and democritic humour be ask what he laugh at be alone that i do laugh alone answer he how many ridiculous thing in my own opinion do i say and answer every day that come over my head and then how many more accord to the opinion of other if i bite my own lip what ought other to do in fine we must live amongst the living and let the river run under the bridge without our care or at least without our interference in truth why do we meet a man with a hunchback or any other deformity without be move and can not endure the encounter of a deformed mind without be angry this vicious sourness stick more to the judge than to the crime let u always have this saying of plato in our mouth do not i think thing unsound because i be not sound in myself be i not myself in fault may not my observation reflect upon myself a wise and divine say that lash the most universal and common error of mankind not only the reproach that we throw in the face of one another but our reason also our argument and controversy be rebound upon u and we wind ourselves with our own weapon of which antiquity have leave me enough grave example it be ingeniously and homesaid by him who be the inventor of this sentence we see nothing behind u we mock ourselves an hundred time a day when we deride our neighbour and we detest in other the defect which be more manifest in u and which we admire with marvellous inadvertency and impudence it be but yesterday that i hear a man of understanding and of good rank as pleasantly a justly scoff at the folly of another who do nothing but torment everybody with the catalogue of hi genealogy and alliance above half of them false for they be most apt to fall into such ridiculous discourse whose quality be most dubious and least sure and yet would he have look into himself he would have discern himself to be no less intemperate and wearisome in extol hi wife pedigree o importunate presumption with which the wife see herself arm by the hand of her own husband did he understand latin we should say to him i do not say that no man should accuse another who be not clean himself for then no one would ever accuse clean from the same sort of spot but i mean that our judgment fall upon another who be then in question should not at the same time spare ourselves but sentence u with an inward and severe authority ti an office of charity that he who can not reclaim himself from a vice should nevertheless endeavour to remove it from another in whom peradventure it may not have so deep and so malignant a root neither do him who reprove me for my fault that he himself be guilty of the same what of that the reproof be notwithstanding true and of very good use have we a good nose our own ordure would stink bad to u forasmuch a it be our own and socrates be of opinion that whoever should find himself hi son and a stranger guilty of any violence and wrong ought to begin with himself present himself first to the sentence of justice and implore to purge himself the assistance of the hand of the executioner in the next place he should proceed to hi son and lastly to the stranger if this precept seem too severe he ought at least to present himself the first to the punishment of hi own conscience the sens be our first and proper judge which perceive not thing but by external accident and ti no wonder if in all the part of the service of our society there be so perpetual and universal a mixture of ceremony and superficial appearance insomuch that the best and most effectual part of our polity therein consist ti still man with whom we have to do of whom the condition be wonderfully corporal let those who of these late year would erect for u such a contemplative and immaterial an exercise of religion not wonder if there be some who think it have vanish and melt through their finger have it not more upheld itself among u a a mark title and instrument of division and faction than by itself a in conference the gravity robe and fortune of him who speak ofttimes give reputation to vain argument and idle word it be not to be presume but that a man so attended and fear have not in him more than ordinary sufficiency and that he to whom the king have give so many office and commission and charge he so supercilious and proud have not a great deal more in him than another who salute him at so great a distance and who have no employment at all not only the word but the grimace also of these people be consider and put into the account every one make it hi business to give them some fine and solid interpretation if they stoop to the common conference and that you offer anything but approbation and reverence they then knock you down with the authority of their experience they have hear they have see they have do so and so you be crush with example i should willingly tell them that the fruit of a surgeon experience be not the history of hi practice and hi remembering that he have cure four people of the plague and three of the gout unless he know how thence to extract something whereon to form hi judgment and to make u sensible that he have thence become more skillful in hi art a in a concert of instrument we do not hear a lute a harpsichord or a flute alone but one entire harmony the result of all together if travel and office have improve them tis a product of their understanding to make it appear ti not enough to reckon experience they must weigh sort and distil them to extract the reason and conclusion they carry along with them there be never so many historian it be indeed good and of use to read them for they furnish u everywhere with excellent and laudable instruction from the magazine of their memory which doubtless be of great concern to the help of life but ti not that we seek for now we examine whether these relaters and collector of thing be commendable themselves i hate all sort of tyranny both in word and deed i be very ready to oppose myself against those vain circumstance that delude our judgment by the sens and keep my eye close upon those extraordinary greatness i find that at best they be men a other be peradventure we esteem and look upon them for less than they be by reason they undertake more and more expose themselves they do not answer to the charge they have undertake there must be more vigour and strength in the bearer than in the burden he who have not lift as much a he can leave you to guess that he have still a strength beyond that and that he have not be try to the utmost of what he be able to do he who sink under hi load make a discovery of hi best and the weakness of hi shoulder this be the reason that we see so many silly souls amongst the learned and more than those of the good sort they would have make good husbandman good merchant and good artisan their natural vigour be cut out to that proportion knowledge be a thing of great weight they faint under it their understanding have neither vigour nor dexterity enough to set forth and distribute to employ or make use of this rich and powerful matter it have no prevail virtue but in a strong nature and such nature be very rare and the weak one say socrates corrupt the dignity of philosophy in the handling it appear useless and vicious when lodge in an illcontrived mind they spoil and make fool of themselves neither be it enough for those who govern and command u and have all the world in their hand to have a common understanding and to be able to do the same that we can they be very much below u if they be not infinitely above u a they promise more so they be to perform more and yet silence be to them not only a countenance of respect and gravity but very often of good advantage too for megabyzus go to see apelles in hi paintingroom stand a great while without speak a word and at last begin to talk of hi painting for which he receive this rude reproof whilst thou wast silent thou seemedst to be some great thing by reason of thy chain and rich habit but now that we have hear thee speak there be not the mean boy in my workshop that do not despise thee those princely ornament that mighty state do not permit him to be ignorant with a common ignorance and to speak impertinently of paint he ought to have keep this external and presumptive knowledge by silence to how many foolish fellow of my time have a sullen and silent mien procure the credit of prudence and capacity dignity and office be of necessity confer more by fortune than upon the account of merit and we be often to blame to condemn king when these be misplace on the contrary ti a wonder they should have so good luck where there be so little skill for nature have not give them a sight that can extend to so many people to discern which excel the rest nor to penetrate into our bosom where the knowledge of our will and best value lie they must choose u by conjecture and by grope by the family wealth learning and the voice of the people which be all very feeble argument whoever could find out a way by which they might judge by justice and choose men by reason would in this one thing establish a perfect form of government ay but he bring that great affair to a very good pas this be indeed to say something but not to say enough for this sentence be justly receive that we be not to judge of counsel by event the carthaginian punish the ill counsel of their captain though they be rectify by a successful issue and the roman people often deny a triumph for great and very advantageous victory because the conduct of their general be not answerable to hi good fortune we ordinarily see in the action of the world that fortune to shew u her power in all thing and who take a pride in abate our presumption see she could not make fool wise have make them fortunate in emulation of virtue and most favour those operation the web of which be most purely her own whence it be that the simple amongst u bring to pass great business both public and private and a seiramnes the persian answer those who wonder that hi affair succeed so ill consider that hi deliberation be so wise that he be sole master of hi design but that success be wholly in the power of fortune these may answer the same but with a contrary turn most worldly affair be perform by themselves the event often justify a very foolish conduct our interposition be little more than a it be a run on by rote and more commonly a consideration of custom and example than of reason being formerly astonish at the greatness of some affair i have be make acquaint with their motif and address by those who have perform it and have find nothing in it but very ordinary counsel and the most common and usual be indeed perhaps the most sure and convenient for practice if not for show what if the plain reason be the best seat the mean lowest and most beat more adapted to affair to maintain the authority of the counsel of king it need not that profane person should participate of them or see further into them than the outmost barrier he who will husband it reputation must be reverence upon credit and take altogether my consultation somewhat roughhews the matter and considers it lightly by the first face it present the stress and main of the business i have be wont to refer to heaven good and ill fortune be in my opinion two sovereign power tis folly to think that human prudence can play the part of fortune and vain be hi attempt who presume to comprehend both cause and consequence and by the hand to conduct the progress of hi design and most especially vain in the deliberation of war there be never great circumspection and military prudence than sometimes be see amongst u can it be that men be afraid to lose themselves by the way that they reserve themselves to the end of the game i moreover affirm that our wisdom itself and consultation for the most part commit themselves to the conduct of chance my will and my reason be sometimes move by one breath and sometimes by another and many of these movement there be that govern themselves without me my reason have uncertain and casual agitation and impulsion let a man but observe who be of great authority in city and who best do their own business we shall find that they be commonly men of the least part woman child and madman have have the fortune to govern great kingdom equally well with the wise prince and thucydides say that the stupid more ordinarily do it than those of good understanding we attribute the effect of their good fortune to their prudence wherefore i say unreservedly event be a very poor testimony of our worth and part now i be upon this point that there need no more but to see a man promote to dignity though we know him but three day before a man of little regard yet an image of grandeur of sufficiency insensibly steal into our opinion and we persuade ourselves that be augment in reputation and train he be also increase in merit we judge of him not accord to hi worth but a we do by counter accord to the prerogative of hi place if it happen so that he fall again and be mix with the common crowd every one inquire with amazement into the cause of hi have be raise so high be this he say they be he no wiser when he be there do prince satisfy themselves with so little truly we be in good hand this be a thing that i have often see in my time nay even the very disguise of grandeur represent in our comedy in some sort move and gull u that which i myself adore in king be the crowd of their adorer all reverence and submission be due to them except that of the understanding my reason be not oblige to bow and bend my knee be melanthius be ask what he think of the tragedy of dionysius i could not see it say he it be so clouded with language so most of those who judge of the discourse of great men ought to say i do not understand hi word they be so cloud with gravity grandeur and majesty antisthenes one day try to persuade the athenian to give order that their ass might be employ in till the ground as well a the horse be to which it be answer that that animal be not destine for such a service thats all one reply he you have only to order it for the most ignorant and incapable men you employ in the command of your war incontinently become worthy enough because you employ them to which the custom of so many people who canonise the king they have choose out of their own body and be not content only to honour but must adore them come very near those of mexico after the ceremony of their king coronation be over dare no more look him in the face but a if they have deify him by hi royalty amongst the oath they make him take to maintain their religion their law and liberty to be valiant just and mild he moreover swear to make the sun run hi course in hi wonted light to drain the cloud at fit season to make river run their course and to cause the earth to bear all thing necessary for hi people i differ from this common fashion and be more apt to suspect the capacity when i see it accompany with that grandeur of fortune and public applause we be to consider of what advantage it be to speak when a man please to choose hi subject to interrupt or change it with a magisterial authority to protect himself from the opposition of other by a nod a smile or silence in the presence of an assembly that tremble with reverence and respect a man of a prodigious fortune come to give hi judgment upon some slight dispute that be foolishly set on foot at hi table begin in these word it can be no other but a liar or a fool that will say otherwise than so and so pursue this philosophical point with a dagger in your hand there be another observation i have make from which i draw great advantage which be that in conference and dispute every word that seem to be good be not immediately to be accept most men be rich in borrow sufficiency a man may say a good thing give a good answer cite a good sentence without at all see the force of either the one or the other that a man may not understand all he borrow may perhaps be verify in myself a man must not always presently yield what truth or beauty soever may seem to be in the opposite argument either he must stoutly meet it or retire under colour of not understand it to try on all part how it be lodge in the author it may happen that we entangle ourselves and help to strengthen the point itself i have sometimes in the necessity and heat of the combat make answer that have go through and through beyond my expectation or hope i only give them in number they be receive in weight a when i contend with a vigorous man i please myself with anticipate hi conclusion i ease him of the trouble of explain himself i strive to forestall hi imagination whilst it be yet spring and imperfect the order and pertinency of hi understanding warn and threaten me afar off i deal quite contrary with the other i must understand and presuppose nothing but by them if they determine in general word this be good that be naught and that they happen to be in the right see if it be not fortune that hit it off for them let them a little circumscribe and limit their judgment why or how it be so these universal judgment that i see so common signify nothing these be men who salute a whole people in a crowd together they who have a real acquaintance take notice of and salute them individually and by name but tis a hazardous attempt and from which i have more than every day see it fall out that weak understanding have a mind to appear ingenious in take notice a they read a book of what be best and most to be admire fix their admiration upon some thing so very ill choose that instead of make u discern the excellence of the author they make u very well see their own ignorance this exclamation be safe that be fine after have hear a whole page of virgil by that the cunning sort save themselves but to undertake to follow him line by line and with an expert and tried judgment to observe where a good author excels himself weigh the word phrase invention and hi various excellence one after another keep aloof from that i every day hear fool say thing that be not foolish they say a good thing let u examine how far they understand it whence they have it and what they mean by it we help them to make use of this fine expression of this fine sentence which be none of theirs they only have it in keep they have bolt it out at a venture we place it for them in credit and esteem you lend them your hand to what purpose they do not think themselves oblige to you for it and become more inept still dont help them let them alone they will handle the matter like people who be afraid of burn their finger they dare change neither it seat nor light nor break into it shake it never so little it slip through their finger they give it up be it never so strong or fair they be fine weapon but ill haft how many time have i see the experience of this now if you come to explain anything to them and to confirm them they catch at it and presently rob you of the advantage of your interpretation it be what i be about to say it be just my idea if i do not express it so it be for want of language mere wind malice itself must be employ to correct this arrogant ignorance the dogma of hegesias that we be neither to hate nor accuse but instruct be correct elsewhere but here tis injustice and inhumanity to relieve and set him right who stand in no need ont and be the bad fort i love to let them step deeply into the mire and so deep that if it be possible they may at last discern their error folly and absurdity be not to be cure by bare admonition and what cyrus answer to him who importune him to harangue hi army upon the point of battle that men do not become valiant and warlike upon a sudden by a fine oration no more than a man become a good musician by hear a fine song may properly be say of such an admonition a this these be apprenticeship that be to be serve beforehand by a long and continued education we owe this care and this assiduity of correction and instruction to our own people but to go preach to the first passerby and to become tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we meet be a thing that i abhor i rarely do it even in private conversation and rather give up the whole thing than proceed to these initiatory and school instruction my humour be unfit either to speak or write for beginner but for thing that be say in common discourse or amongst other thing i never oppose them either by word or sign how false or absurd soever a to the rest nothing vexes me so much in folly a that it be more satisfied with itself than any reason can reasonably be ti unfortunate that prudence forbids u to satisfy and trust ourselves and always dismiss u timorous and discontented whereas obstinacy and temerity fill those who be possess with them with joy and assurance ti for the most ignorant to look at other men over the shoulder always return from the combat full of joy and triumph and moreover for the most part this arrogance of speech and gaiety of countenance give them the good of it in the opinion of the audience which be commonly weak and incapable of well judge and discern the real advantage obstinacy of opinion and heat in argument be the sure proof of folly be there anything so assured resolute disdainful contemplative serious and grave a the as may we not include under the title of conference and communication the quick and sharp repartee which mirth and familiarity introduce amongst friend pleasantly and wittily jesting and rally with one another ti an exercise for which my natural gaiety render me fit enough and which if it be not so tense and serious a the other i speak of but now be a lycurgus think no less smart and ingenious nor of less utility for my part i contribute to it more liberty than wit and have therein more of luck than invention but i be perfect in suffer for i endure a retaliation that be not only tart but indiscreet to boot without be move at all and whoever attack me if i have not a brisk answer immediately ready i do not study to pursue the point with a tedious and impertinent contest border upon obstinacy but let it pass and hang down cheerfully my ear defer my revenge to another and good time there be no merchant that always gain most men change their countenance and their voice where their wit fail and by an unseasonable anger instead of revenge themselves accuse at once their own folly and impatience in this jollity we sometimes pinch the secret string of our imperfection which at another and grave time we can not touch without offence and so profitably give one another a hint of our defect there be other jeux de main rude and indiscreet after the french manner that i mortally hate my skin be very tender and sensible i have in my time see two prince of the blood bury upon that very account ti unhandsome to fight in play a to the rest when i have a mind to judge of any one i ask him how far he be content with himself to what degree hi speaking or hi work please him i will none of these fine excuse i do it only in sport i be not an hour about it i have never look at it since well then say i lay these aside and give me a perfect one such a you would be measure by and then what do you think be the best thing in your work be it this part or that be it grace or the matter the invention the judgment or the learning for i find that men be commonly a wide of the mark in judging of their own work a of those of other not only by reason of the kindness they have for them but for want of capacity to know and distinguish them the work by it own force and fortune may second the workman and sometimes outstrip him beyond hi invention and knowledge for my part i judge of the value of other men work more obscurely than of my own and place the essay now high or low with great doubt and inconstancy there be several book that be useful upon the account of their subject from which the author derive no praise and good book as well a good work that shame the workman i may write the manner of our feast and the fashion of our clothes and may write them ill i may publish the edict of my time and the letter of prince that pass from hand to hand i may make an abridgment of a good book and every abridgment of a good book be a foolish abridgment which book shall come to be lose and so on posterity will derive a singular utility from such composition but what honour shall i have unless by great good fortune most part of the famous book be of this condition when i read philip de commines doubtless a very good author several year ago i there take notice of this for no vulgar say that a man must have a care not to do hi master so great service that at last he will not know how to give him hi just reward but i ought to commend the invention not him because i meet with it in tacitus not long since and seneca vigorously say q cicero say with less directness the subject accord to what it be may make a man look upon a learned and of good memory but to judge in him the part that be most hi own and the most worthy the vigour and beauty of hi soul one must first know what be hi own and what be not and in that which be not hi own how much we be oblige to him for the choice disposition ornament and language he have there present u with what if he have borrow the matter and spoil the form a it often fall out we who be little read in book be in this strait that when we meet with a high fancy in some new poet or some strong argument in a preacher we dare not nevertheless commend it till we have first inform ourselves through some learn man if it be the writer wit or borrow from some other until that i always stand upon my guard i have lately be read the history of tacitus quite through without interrupt it with anything els which but seldom happens with me it be twenty year since i have keep to any one book an hour together and i do it at the instance of a gentleman for whom france have a great esteem as well for hi own particular worth a upon the account of a constant form of capacity and virtue which run through a great many brother of them i do not know any author in a public narrative who mix so much consideration of manner and particular inclination and i be of a quite contrary opinion to him hold that have especially to follow the life of the emperor of hi time so various and extreme in all sort of form so many notable action a their cruelty especially produce in their subject he have a strong and more attractive matter to treat of than if he have have to describe battle and universal commotion so that i often find him sterile run over those brave death a if he fear to trouble u with their multitude and length this form of history be by much the most useful public movement depend most upon the conduct of fortune private one upon our own ti rather a judgment than a narration of history there be in it more precept than story it be not a book to read tis a book to study and learn ti full of sententious opinion right or wrong ti a nursery of ethic and politic discourse for the use and ornament of those who have any place in the government of the world he always argue by strong and solid reason after a pointed and subtle manner accord to the affected style of that age which be so in love with an inflated manner that where point and subtlety be want in thing it supply these with lofty and swell word ti not much unlike the style of seneca i look upon tacitus a more sinewy and seneca a more sharp hi pen seem most proper for a troubled and sick state a ours at present be you would often say that he paint and pinch u they who doubt hi good faith sufficiently accuse themselves of be hi enemy upon some other account hi opinion be sound and lean to the right side in the roman affair and yet i be angry at him for judge more severely of pompey than consist with the opinion of those worthy men who live in the same time and have dealing with him and to have repute him on a par with marius and sylla except that he be more close other writer have not acquit hi intention in the government of affair from ambition and revenge and even hi friend be afraid that victory would have transport him beyond the bound of reason but not to so immeasurable a degree a theirs nothing in hi life threaten such express cruelty and tyranny neither ought we to set suspicion against evidence and therefore i do not believe plutarch in this matter that hi narration be genuine and straightforward may perhaps be argue from this very thing that they do not always apply to the conclusion of hi judgment which he follow accord to the bias he have take very often beyond the matter he present u withal which he have not deign to alter in the least degree he need no excuse for have approve the religion of hi time accord a the law enjoin and to have be ignorant of the true this be hi misfortune not hi fault i have principally consider hi judgment and be not very well satisfy therewith throughout a these word in the letter that tiberius old and sick sent to the senate what shall i write to you sirs or how should i write to you or what should i not write to you at this time may the god and goddess lay a bad punishment upon me than i be every day torment with if i know i do not see why he should so positively apply them to a sharp remorse that torment the conscience of tiberius at least when i be in the same condition i perceive no such thing and this also seem to me a little mean in him that have to say that he have bear an honourable office in rome he excuse himself that he do not say it out of ostentation this seem i say mean for such a soul a hi for not to speak roundly of a man self imply some want of courage a man of solid and lofty judgment who judge soundly and surely make use of hi own example upon all occasion as well a those of other and give evidence a freely of himself a of a third person we be to pass by these common rule of civility in favour of truth and liberty i dare not only speak of myself but to speak only of myself when i write of anything els i miss my way and wander from my subject i be not so indiscreetly enamour of myself so wholly mixed up with and bind to myself that i can not distinguish and consider myself apart a i do a neighbour or a tree ti equally a fault not to discern how far a man worth extends and to say more than a man discover in himself we owe more love to god than to ourselves and know him less and yet speak of him as much a we will if the writing of tacitus indicate anything true of hi quality he be a great personage upright and bold not of a superstitious but of a philosophical and generous virtue one may think him bold in hi relation a where he tell u that a soldier carry a burden of wood hi hand be so frozen and so stuck to the load that they there remain closed and dead be sever from hi arm i always in such thing bow to the authority of so great witness what also he say that vespasian by the favour of the god serapis cure a blind woman at alexandria by anoint her eye with hi spittle and i know not what other miracle he say by the example and duty of all hi good historian they record all event of importance and amongst public incident be the popular rumour and opinion tis their part to relate common belief not to regulate them that part concern divine and philosopher director of conscience and therefore it be that this companion of hi and a great man like himself very wisely say and this other and write in an age wherein the belief of prodigy begin to decline he say he would not nevertheless forbear to insert in hi annals and to give a relation of thing receive by so many worthy men and with so great reverence of antiquity ti very well say let them deliver to u history more a they receive it than a they believe it i who be monarch of the matter whereof i treat and who be accountable to none do not nevertheless always believe myself i often hazard sally of my own wit wherein i very much suspect myself and certain verbal quibble at which i shake my ear but i let them go at a venture i see that other get reputation by such thing tis not for me alone to judge i present myself stand and lie before and behind my right side and my left and in all my natural posture wits though equal in force be not always equal in taste and application this be what my memory present to me in gross and with uncertainty enough all judgment in gross be weak and imperfect there be peradventure no more manifest vanity than to write of it so vainly that which divinity have so divinely express to u ought to be carefully and continually meditate by men of understand who do not see that i have take a road in which incessantly and without labour i shall proceed so long a there shall be ink and paper in the world i can give no account of my life by my action fortune have place them too low i must do it by my fancy and yet i have see a gentleman who only communicate hi life by the working of hi belly you might see on hi premise a show of a row of basin of seven or eight day stand it be hi study hi discourse all other talk stank in hi nostril here but not so nauseous be the excrement of an old mind sometimes thick sometimes thin and always indigested and when shall i have do represent the continual agitation and mutation of my thought a they come into my head see that diomedes write six thousand book upon the sole subject of grammar what then ought prate to produce since prattling and the first beginning to speak stuffed the world with such a horrible load of volume so many word for word only o pythagoras why didst not thou allay this tempest they accuse one galba of old for living idly he make answer that every one ought to give account of hi action but not of hi home he be mistake for justice also take cognisance of those who glean after the reaper but there should be some restraint of law against foolish and impertinent scribbler as well a against vagabond and idle person which if there be both i and a hundred other would be banish from the reach of our people i do not speak this in jest scribbling seem to be a symptom of a disordered and licentious age when do we write so much a since our trouble when the roman so much a upon the point of ruin besides that the refining of wit do not make people wiser in a government this idle employment spring from this that every one apply himself negligently to the duty of hi vocation and be easily debauch from it the corruption of the age be make up by the particular contribution of every individual man some contribute treachery other injustice irreligion tyranny avarice cruelty accord to their power the weak sort contribute folly vanity and idleness of these i be one it seem a if it be the season for vain thing when the hurtful oppress u in a time when do ill be common to do but what signifies nothing be a kind of commendation ti my comfort that i shall be one of the last who shall be call in question and whilst the great offender be be bring to account i shall have leisure to amend for it would methinks be against reason to punish little inconvenience whilst we be infest with the great a the physician philotimus say to one who present him hi finger to dress and who he perceive both by hi complexion and hi breath have an ulcer in hi lung friend it be not now time to play with your nail and yet i saw some year ago a person whose name and memory i have in very great esteem in the very height of our great disorder when there be neither law nor justice nor magistrate who perform hi office no more than there be now publish i know not what pitiful reformation about cloths cookery and law chicanery those be amusement wherewith to fee a people that be illused to show that they be not totally forget those other do the same who insist upon prohibit particular way of speaking dance and game to a people totally abandon to all sort of execrable vice ti no time to bathe and cleanse one self when one be seize by a violent fever it be for the spartan alone to fall to comb and curl themselves when they be just upon the point of run headlong into some extreme danger of their life for my part i have that bad custom that if my slipper go awry i let my shirt and my cloak do so too i scorn to mend myself by half when i be in a bad plight i fasten upon the mischief i abandon myself through despair i let myself go towards the precipice and a they say throw the helve after the hatchet i be obstinate in grow bad and think myself no longer worth my own care i be either well or ill throughout t be a favour to me that the desolation of this kingdom fall out in the desolation of my age i better suffer that my ill be multiply than if my well have be disturb the word i utter in mishap be word of anger my courage set up it bristle instead of let them down and contrary to other i be more devout in good than in evil fortune accord to the precept of xenophon if not accord to hi reason and be more ready to turn up my eye to heaven to return thanks than to crave i be more solicitous to improve my health when i be well than to restore it when i be sick prosperity be the same discipline and instruction to me that adversity and rod be to other a if good fortune be a thing inconsistent with good conscience men never grow good but in evil fortune good fortune be to me a singular spur to modesty and moderation an entreaty win a threat check me favour make me bend fear stiffens me amongst human condition this be common enough to be good pleased with foreign thing than with our own and to love innovation and change i have my share those who follow the other extreme of be quite satisfied and pleased with and in themselves of value what they have above all the rest and of conclude no beauty can be great than what they see if they be not wise than we be really more happy i do not envy their wisdom but their good fortune this greedy humour of new and unknown thing help to nourish in me the desire of travel but a great many more circumstance contribute to it i be very willing to quit the government of my house there be i confess a kind of convenience in command though it be but in a barn and in be obey by one people but tis too uniform and languid a pleasure and be moreover of necessity mix with a thousand vexatious thought one while the poverty and the oppression of your tenant another quarrel amongst neighbours another the trespass they make upon you afflict you and that god scarce in six month send a season wherein your bailiff can do hi business a he should but that if it serve the vine it spoil the meadow to which may be add the new and neatmade shoe of the man of old that hurt your foot and that a stranger do not understand how much it cost you and what you contribute to maintain that show of order that be see in your family and that peradventure you buy too dear i come late to the government of a house they whom nature send into the world before me long ease me of that trouble so that i have already take another bent more suitable to my humour yet for so much a i have see ti an employment more troublesome than hard whoever be capable of anything els will easily do this had i a mind to be rich that way would seem too long i have serve my king a more profitable traffic than any other since i pretend to nothing but the reputation of have get nothing or dissipate nothing conformably to the rest of my life improper either to do good or ill of any moment and that i only desire to pass on i can do it thank be to god without any great endeavour at the bad evermore prevent poverty by lessen your expense ti that which i make my great concern and doubt not but to do it before i shall be compel a to the rest i have sufficiently settle my thought to live upon less than i have and live contentedly my real need do not so wholly take up all i have that fortune have not whereon to fasten her teeth without bite to the quick my presence heedless and ignorant a it be do me great service in my domestic affair i employ myself in them but it go against the hair find that i have this in my house that though i burn my candle at one end by myself the other be not spar journey do me no harm but only by their expense which be great and more than i be well able to bear be always wont to travel with not only a necessary but a handsome equipage i must make them so much short and few i spend therein but the froth and what i have reserve for such us delay and defer my motion till that be ready i will not that the pleasure of go abroad spoil the pleasure of be retire at home on the contrary i intend they shall nourish and favour one another fortune have assist me in this that since my principal profession in this life be to live at ease and rather idly than busily she have deprive me of the necessity of grow rich to provide for the multitude of my heir if there be not enough for one of that whereof i have so plentifully enough at hi peril be it hi imprudence will not deserve that i should wish him any more and every one accord to the example of phocion provide sufficiently for hi child who so provide for them a to leave them as much a be leave him i should by no mean like crate way he leave hi money in the hand of a banker with this condition that if hi child be fool he should then give it to them if wise he should then distribute it to the most foolish of the people a if fool for be less capable of live without rich be more capable of use them at all event the damage occasion by my absence seem not to deserve so long a i be able to support it that i should waive the occasion of divert myself by that troublesome assistance there be always something that go amiss the affair one while of one house and then of another tear you to piece you pry into everything too near your perspicacity hurt you here as well a in other thing i steal away from occasion of vex myself and turn from the knowledge of thing that go amiss and yet i can not so order it but that every hour i jostle against something or other that displease me and the trick that they most conceal from me be those that i the soonest come to know some there be that not to make matter bad a man must himself help to conceal vain vexation vain sometimes but always vexation the small and slight impediment be the most piercing and as little letter most tire the eye so do little affair most disturb u the rout of little ill more offend than one how great soever by how much domestic thorn be numerous and slight by so much they prick deep and without warn easily surprising u when least we suspect them i be no philosopher evils oppress me accord to their weight and they weigh as much accord to the form a the matter and very often more if i have therein more perspicacity than the vulgar i have also more patience in short they weigh with me if they do not hurt me life be a tender thing and easily molest since my age have make me grow more pensive and morose for the most trivial cause imaginable i irritate that humour which afterwards nourishes and exasperate itself of it own motion attract and heap up matter upon matter whereon to fee these continual tricklings consume and ulcerate me ordinary inconvenience be never light they be continual and inseparable especially when they spring from the member of a family continual and inseparable when i consider my affair at distance and in gross i find because perhaps my memory be none of the best that they have go on hitherto improve beyond my reason or expectation my revenue seem great than it be it prosperity betrays me but when i pry more narrowly into the business and see how all thing go i have a thousand thing to desire and to fear to give them quite over be very easy for me to do but to look after them without trouble be very hard ti a miserable thing to be in a place where everything you see employs and concern you and i fancy that i more cheerfully enjoy the pleasure of another man house and with great and a purer relish than those of my own diogenes answer accord to my humour him who ask him what sort of wine he like the best that of another say he my father take a delight in building at montaigne where he be bear and in all the government of domestic affair i love to follow hi example and rule and i shall engage those who be to succeed me as much a in me lie to do the same could i do well for him i would and be proud that hi will be still perform and act by me god forbid that in my hand i should ever suffer any image of life that i be able to render to so good a father to fail and wherever i have take in hand to strengthen some old foundation of wall and to repair some ruinous building in earnest i have do it more out of respect to hi design than my own satisfaction and be angry at myself that i have not proceed far to finish the beginning he leave in hi house and so much the more because i be very likely to be the last possessor of my race and to give the last hand to it for a to my own particular application neither the pleasure of build which they say be so bewitching nor hunting nor garden nor the other pleasure of a retired life can much amuse me and tis what i be angry at myself for a i be for all other opinion that be incommodious to me which i would not so much care to have vigorous and learn a i would have them easy and convenient for life they be true and sound enough if they be useful and please such a hear me declare my ignorance in husbandry whisper in my ear that it be disdain and that i neglect to know it instrument it season it order how they dress my vine how they graft and to know the name and form of herb and fruit and the prepare the meat on which i live the name and price of the stuff i wear because say they i have set my heart upon some high knowledge they kill me in say so it be not disdain it be folly and rather stupidity than glory i have rather be a good horseman than a good logician we occupy our thought about the general and about universal cause and conduct which will very well carry on themselves without our care and leave our own business at random and michael much more our concern than man now i be indeed for the most part at home but i would be there well pleased than anywhere els i know not whether or no i shall bring it about i could wish that instead of some other member of hi succession my father have resign to me the passionate affection he have in hi old age to hi household affair he be happy in that he could accommodate hi desire to hi fortune and satisfy himself with what he have political philosophy may to much purpose condemn the meanness and sterility of my employment if i can once come to relish it a he do i be of opinion that the most honourable call be to serve the public and to be useful to many for myself i disclaim it partly out of conscience for where i see the weight that lie upon such employment i perceive also the little mean i have to supply it and plato a master in all political government himself nevertheless take care to abstain from it and partly out of cowardice i content myself with enjoy the world without bustle onlyto live an excusable life and such a may neither be a burden to myself nor to any other never do any man more fully and feebly suffer himself to be govern by a third person than i should do have i any one to whom to entrust myself one of my wish at this time should be to have a soninlaw that know handsomely how to cherish my old age and to rock it asleep into whose hand i might deposit in full sovereignty the management and use of all my good that he might dispose of them a i do and get by them what i get provide that he on hi part be truly acknowledge and a friend but we live in a world where loyalty of one own child be unknown he who have the charge of my purse in hi travel have it purely and without control he could cheat me thoroughly if he come to reckon and if he be not a devil i oblige him to deal faithfully with me by so entire a trust the most common security i take of my people be ignorance i never presume any to be vicious till i have first find them so and repose the most confidence in the young sort that i think be least spoil by ill example i have rather be tell at two month end that i have spend four hundred crown than to have my ear batter every night with three five seven and i have be in this way a little robbed a another it be true i be willing enough not to see it i in some sort purposely harbour a kind of perplexed uncertain knowledge of my money up to a certain point i be content to doubt one must leave a little room for the infidelity or indiscretion of a servant if you have leave enough in gross to do your business let the overplus of fortune liberality run a little more freely at her mercy ti the gleaner portion after all i do not so much value the fidelity of my people a i contemn their injury what a mean and ridiculous thing it be for a man to study hi money to delight in handle and tell it over and over again tis by this avarice make it approach in eighteen year that i have have my estate in my own hand i could never prevail with myself either to read over my deed or examine my principal affair which ought of necessity to pass under my knowledge and inspection ti not a philosophical disdain of worldly and transitory thing my taste be not purify to that degree and i value them at as great a rate at least a they be worth but ti in truth an inexcusable and childish laziness and negligence what would i not rather do than read a contract or than a a slave to my own business tumble over those dusty writing or which be bad those of another man a so many do nowadays to get money i grudge nothing but care and trouble and endeavour nothing so much a to be careless and at ease i have be much fitter i believe could it have be without obligation and servitude to have live upon another man fortune than my own and indeed i do not know when i examine it nearer whether accord to my humour what i have to suffer from my affair and servant have not in it something more abject troublesome and torment than there would be in serve a man well bear than myself who would govern me with a gentle rein and a little at my own case crate do worse who throw himself into the liberty of poverty only to rid himself of the inconvenience and care of hi house this be what i would not do i hate poverty equally with pain but i could be content to change the kind of life i live for another that be humble and less chargeable when absent from home i divest myself of all these thought and should be less concerned for the ruin of a tower than i be when present at the fall of a tile my mind be easily compose at distance but suffers as much a that of the mean peasant when i be at home the rein of my bridle be wrongly put on or a strap flapping against my leg will keep me out of humour a day together i raise my courage well enough against inconvenience lift up my eye i can not i be at home responsible for whatever go amiss few master i speak of those of medium condition such a mine and if there be any such they be more happy can rely so much upon another but that the great part of the burden will lie upon their own shoulder this take much from my grace in entertaining visitor so that i have peradventure detain some rather out of expectation of a good dinner than by my own behaviour and lose much of the pleasure i ought to reap at my own house from the visitation and assembling of my friend the most ridiculous carriage of a gentleman in hi own house be to see him bustle about the business of the place whisper one servant and look an angry look at another it ought insensibly to slide along and to represent an ordinary current and i think it unhandsome to talk much to our guest of their entertainment whether by way of bragging or excuse i love order and cleanliness more than abundance and at home have an exact regard to necessity little to outward show if a footman fall to cuff at another man house or stumble and throw a dish before him a he be carry it up you only laugh and make a jest ont you sleep whilst the master of the house be arrange a bill of fare with hi steward for your morrow entertainment i speak accord a i do myself quite appreciate nevertheless good husbandry in general and how pleasant quiet and prosperous household management carry regularly on be to some nature and not wish to fasten my own error and inconvenience to the thing nor to give plato the lie who look upon it a the most pleasant employment to every one to do hi particular affair without wrong to another when i travel i have nothing to care for but myself and the lay out my money which be dispose of by one single precept too many thing be require to the rake it together in that i understand nothing in spending i understand a little and how to give some show to my expense which be indeed it principal use but i rely too ambitiously upon it which render it unequal and difform and moreover immoderate in both the one and the other aspect if it make a show if it serve the turn i indiscreetly let it run and a indiscreetly tie up my pursestrings if it do not shine and do not please me whatever it be whether art or nature that imprint in u the condition of living by reference to other it do u much more harm than good we deprive ourselves of our own utility to accommodate appearance to the common opinion we care not so much what our be be a to u and in reality a what it be to the public observation even the property of the mind and wisdom itself seem fruitless to u if only enjoy by ourselves and if it produce not itself to the view and approbation of other there be a sort of men whose gold run in stream underground imperceptibly other expose it all in plate and branch so that to the one a liard be worth a crown and to the other the inverse the world esteem it use and value accord to the show all overnice solicitude about rich smell of avarice even the very disposing of it with a too systematic and artificial liberality be not worth a painful superintendence and solicitude he that will order hi expense to just so much make it too pinch and narrow the keep or spending be of themselves indifferent thing and receive no colour of good or ill but accord to the application of the will the other cause that tempt me out to these journey be inaptitude for the present manner in our state i could easily console myself for this corruption in regard to the public interest but not to my own i be in particular too much oppress by them for in my neighbourhood we be of late by the long licence of our civil war grow old in so riotous a form of state that in earnest ti a wonder how it can subsist in fine i see by our example that the society of men be maintain and hold together at what price soever in what condition soever they be place they still close and stick together both move and in heap a ill united body that shuffle together without order find of themselves a mean to unite and settle often good than they could have be dispose by art king philip muster up a rabble of the most wicked and incorrigible rascal he could pick out and put them all together into a city he have cause to be build for that purpose which bore their name i believe that they even from vice themselves erect a government amongst them and a commodious and just society i see not one action or three or a hundred but manner in common and receive use so ferocious especially in inhumanity and treachery which be to me the bad of all vice that i have not the heart to think of them without horror and almost a much admire a i detest them the exercise of these signal villainy carry with it a great sign of vigour and force of soul a of error and disorder necessity reconciles and brings men together and this accidental connection afterwards form itself into law for there have be such as savage a any human opinion could conceive who nevertheless have maintain their body with as much health and length of life a any plato or aristotle could invent and certainly all these description of polity feign by art be find to be ridiculous and unfit to be put in practice these great and tedious debate about the best form of society and the most commodious rule to bind u be debate only proper for the exercise of our wit a in the art there be several subject which have their be in agitation and controversy and have no life but there such an idea of government might be of some value in a new world but we take a world already make and form to certain custom we do not beget it a pyrrha or cadmus do by what mean soever we may have the privilege to redress and reform it anew we can hardly writhe it from it wonted bent but we shall break all solon be ask whether he have establish the best law he could for the athenian yes say he of those they would have receive varro excuse himself after the same manner that if he be to begin to write of religion he would say what he believe but see it be already receive he would write rather accord to use than nature not accord to opinion but in truth and reality the best and most excellent government for every nation be that under which it be maintain it form and essential convenience depend upon custom we be apt to be displease at the present condition but i nevertheless maintain that to desire command in a few in a republic or another sort of government in monarchy than that already establish be both vice and folly so write the good monsieur de pibrac whom we have lately lose a man of so excellent a wit such sound opinion and such gentle manner this loss and that at the same time we have have of monsieur de foix be of so great importance to the crown that i do not know whether there be another couple in france worthy to supply the place of these two gascons in sincerity and wisdom in the council of our king they be both variously great men and certainly accord to the age rare and great each of them in hi kind but what destiny be it that place them in these time men so remote from and so disproportioned to our corruption and intestine tumult nothing press so hard upon a state a innovation change only give form to injustice and tyranny when any piece be loosen it may be proper to stay it one may take care that the alteration and corruption natural to all thing do not carry u too far from our beginning and principle but to undertake to find so great a mass anew and to change the foundation of so vast a building be for them to do who to make clean efface who reform particular defect by an universal confusion and cure disease by death the world be unapt to be cure and so impatient of anything that press it that it think of nothing but disengage itself at what price soever we see by a thousand examples that it ordinarily cure itself to it cost the discharge of a present evil be no cure if there be not a general amendment of condition the surgeon end be not only to cut away the dead flesh that be but the progress of hi cure he have a care over and above to fill up the wound with good and more natural flesh and to restore the member to it due state whoever only propose to himself to remove that which offend him fall short for good do not necessarily succeed evil another evil may succeed and a bad a it happen to caesar murderer who bring the republic to such a pas that they have reason to repent the meddling with the matter the same have since happen to several other even down to our own time the french my contemporary know it well enough all great mutation shake and disorder a state whoever would look direct at a cure and well consider of it before he begin would be very willing to withdraw hi hand from meddle in it pacuvius calavius correct the vice of this proceeding by a notable example hi fellowcitizens be in mutiny against their magistrate he be a man of great authority in the city of capua find mean one day to shut up the senator in the palace and call the people together in the marketplace there tell them that the day be now come wherein at full liberty they might revenge themselves on the tyrant by whom they have be so long oppressed and whom he have now all alone and unarmed at hi mercy he then advise that they should call these out one by one by lot and should individually determine a to each cause whatever should be decree to be immediately execute with this proviso that they should at the same time depute some honest man in the place of him who be condemn to the end there might be no vacancy in the senate they have no sooner hear the name of one senator but a great cry of universal dislike be raise up against him i see say pacuvius that we must put him out he be a wicked fellow let u look out a good one in hi room immediately there be a profound silence every one be at a stand whom to choose but one more impudent than the rest have name hi man there arose yet a great consent of voice against him an hundred imperfection be lay to hi charge and a many just reason why he should not stand these contradictory humour grow hot it fare worse with the second senator and the third there be a much disagreement in the election of the new a consent in the put out of the old in the end grow weary of this bustle to no purpose they begin some one way and some another to steal out of the assembly every one carry back this resolution in hi mind that the old and best know evil be ever more supportable than one that be new and untried seeing how miserably we be agitate for what have we not do i do not presently conclude we be not peradventure at our last gasp the conservation of state be a thing that in all likelihood surpass our understand a civil government be a plato say a mighty and puissant thing and hard to be dissolve it often continue against mortal and intestine disease against the injury of unjust law against tyranny the corruption and ignorance of magistrate the licence and sedition of the people in all our fortune we compare ourselves to what be above u and still look towards those who be well but let u measure ourselves with what be below u there be no condition so miserable wherein a man may not find a thousand examples that will administer consolation ti our vice that we more unwillingly look upon what be above than willingly upon what be below and solon be use to say that whoever would make a heap of all the ill together there be no one who would not rather choose to bear away the ill he have than to come to an equal division with all other men from that heap and take hi share our government be indeed very sick but there have be other more sick without die the god play at ball with u and bandy u every way the star fatally destine the state of rome for an example of what they could do in this kind in it be comprise all the form and adventure that concern a state all that order or disorder good or evil fortune can do who then can despair of hi condition see the shock and commotion wherewith rome be tumble and toss and yet withstand them all if the extent of dominion be the health of a state which i by no mean think it be and isocrates plea me when he instruct nicocles not to envy prince who have large dominion but those who know how to preserve those which have fall into their hand that of rome be never so sound a when it be most sick the bad of her form be the most fortunate one can hardly discern any image of government under the first emperor it be the most horrible and tumultuous confusion that can be imagine it endure it notwithstanding and therein continue preserve not a monarchy limit within it own bound but so many nation so differ so remote so disaffect so confusedly commanded and so unjustly conquer everything that totters do not fall the contexture of so great a body hold by more nail than one it hold even by it antiquity like old building from which the foundation be wear away by time without roughcast or mortar which yet live and support themselves by their own weight moreover it be not rightly to go to work to examine only the flank and the fo to judge of the security of a place we must observe which way approach can be make to it and in what condition the assailant be few vessel sink with their own weight and without some exterior violence now let u everyway cast our eye everything about u totters in all the great state both of christendom and elsewhere that be know to u if you will but look you will there see evident menace of alteration and ruin astrologer may very well a they do warn u of great revolution and imminent mutation their prophecy be present and palpable they need not go to heaven to foretell this there be not only consolation to be extract from this universal combination of ill and menace but moreover some hope of the continuation of our state forasmuch a naturally nothing fall where all fall universal sickness be particular health conformity be antagonistic to dissolution for my part i despair not and fancy that i discover way to save u who know but that god will have it happen a in human body that purge and restore themselves to a good state by long and grievous malady which render them more entire and perfect health than that they take from them that which weigh the most with me be that in reckon the symptom of our ill i see a many natural one and that heaven send u and properly it own a of those that our disorder and human imprudence contribute to it the very star seem to declare that we have already continue long enough and beyond the ordinary term this also afflict me that the mischief which near threatens u be not an alteration in the entire and solid mass but it dissipation and divulsion which be the most extreme of our fear i moreover fear in these fantasy of mine the treachery of my memory l by inadvertence it should make me write the same thing twice i hate to examine myself and never review but very unwillingly what have once escape my pen i here set down nothing new these be common thought and have peradventure conceive them an hundred time i be afraid i have set them down somewhere els already repetition be everywhere troublesome though it be in homer but tis ruinous in thing that have only a superficial and transitory show i do not love overinsisting even in the most profitable thing a in seneca and the usage of hi stoical school displeases me to repeat upon every subject at full length and width the principle and presupposition that serve in general and always to realledge anew common and universal reason my memory grow cruelly bad every day i must be fain for the time to come for hitherto thanks be to god nothing have happen much amiss whereas other seek time and opportunity to think of what they have to say to avoid all preparation for fear of tie myself to some obligation upon which i must insist to be tie and bind to a thing put me quite out and to depend upon so weak an instrument a my memory i never read this following story that i be not offend at it with a personal and natural resentment lyncestes accuse of conspiracy against alexander the day that he be bring out before the army accord to the custom to be hear a to what he could say for himself have learn a studied speech of which hesitate and stammer he pronounce some word whilst grow more and more perplexed whilst struggle with hi memory and try to recollect what he have to say the soldier nearest to him charge their pike against him and kill him look upon him a convict hi confusion and silence serve them for a confession for have have so much leisure to prepare himself in prison they conclude that it be not hi memory that fail him but that hi conscience tie up hi tongue and stop hi mouth and truly well say the place the assembly the expectation astound a man even when he have but the ambition to speak well what can a man do when tis an harangue upon which hi life depend for my part the very be tie to what i be to say be enough to loose me from it when i wholly commit and refer myself to my memory i lay so much stress upon it that it sink under me it grow dismay with the burden so much a i trust to it so much do i put myself out of my own power even to the find it difficult to keep my own countenance and have be sometimes very much put to it to conceal the slavery wherein i be engage whereas my design be to manifest in speak a perfect calmness both of face and accent and casual and unpremeditated motion a rise from present occasion choose rather to say nothing to purpose than to show that i come prepared to speak well a thing especially unbecoming a man of my profession and of too great obligation on him who can not retain much the preparation beget a great deal more expectation than it will satisfy a man often strip himself to hi doublet to leap no farther than he would have do in hi gown it be record of the orator curio that when he propose the division of hi oration into three or four part or three or four argument or reason it often happen either that he forget some one or add one or two more i have always avoid fall into this inconvenience have ever hat these promise and prescription not only out of distrust of my memory but also because this method relish too much of the artist ti enough that i have promise to myself never again to take upon me to speak in a place of respect for a to speak when a man read hi speech besides that it be very absurd it be a mighty disadvantage to those who naturally could give it a grace by action and to rely upon the mercy of my present invention i would much less do it tis heavy and perplexed and such a would never furnish me in sudden and important necessity permit reader this essay it course also and this third sit to finish the rest of my picture i add but i correct not first because i conceive that a man have once part with hi labour to the world he have no far right to them let him do well if he can in some new undertaking but not adulterate what he have already sell of such dealer nothing should be buy till after they be dead let them well consider what they do before they produce it to the light who hasten them my book be always the same saving that upon every new edition that the buyer may not go away quite empty i take the liberty to add a ti but an ill joint marqueterie some supernumerary emblem it be but overweight that do not disfigure the primitive form of the essay but by a little artful subtlety give a kind of particular value to every one of those that follow thence however will easily happen some transposition of chronology my story take place accord to their opportuneness not always accord to their age secondly because a to what concern myself i fear to lose by change my understanding do not always go forward it go backward too i do not much less suspect my fancy for be the second or the third than for be the first or present or past we often correct ourselves as foolishly a we do other i be grown older by a great many year since my first publication which be in the year 1580 but i very much doubt whether i be grow an inch the wiser i now and i anon be two several person but whether good i can not determine it be a fine thing to be old if we only travel towards improvement but tis a drunken stumbling reel infirm motion like that of reed which the air casually wave to and fro at pleasure antiochus have in hi youth strongly write in favour of the academy in hi old age he write as much against it would not which of these two soever i should follow be still antiochus after have establish the uncertainty to go about to establish the certainty of human opinion be it not to establish doubt and not certainty and to promise that have he have yet another age to live he would be always upon term of alter hi judgment not so much for the good a for something els the public favour have give me a little more confidence than i expect but what i most fear be l i should glut the world with my writing i have rather of the two pique my reader than tire him a a learned man of my time have do praise be always please let it come from whom or upon what account it will yet ought a man to understand why he be commend that he may know how to keep up the same reputation still imperfections themselves may get commendation the vulgar and common estimation be seldom happy in hit and i be much mistake if amongst the writing of my time the bad be not those which have most gain the popular applause for my part i return my thanks to those goodnatured men who be pleased to take my weak endeavour in good part the fault of the workmanship be nowhere so apparent a in a matter which of itself have no recommendation blame not me reader for those that slip in here by the fancy or inadvertency of other every hand every artisan contribute their own material i neither concern myself with orthography and only care to have it after the old way nor point be very inexpert both in the one and the other where they wholly break the sense i be very little concern for they at least discharge me but where they substitute a false one a they so often do and wrest me to their conception they ruin me when the sentence nevertheless be not strong enough for my proportion a civil person ought to reject it a spurious and none of mine whoever shall know how lazy i be and how indulgent to my own humour will easily believe that i have rather write a many more essay than be tie to revise these over again for so childish a correction i say elsewhere that be plant in the very centre of this new religion i be not only deprive of any great familiarity with men of other kind of manner than my own and of other opinion by which they hold together a by a tie that supersede all other obligation but moreover i do not live without danger amongst men to whom all thing be equally lawful and of whom the most part can not offend the law more than they have already do from which the extremist degree of licence proceeds all the particular be sum up together i do not find one man of my country who pay so dear for the defence of our law both in loss and damage a the lawyer say a myself and some there be who vapour and brag of their zeal and constancy that if thing be justly weigh do much less than i my house a one that have ever be open and free to all comer and civil to all for i could never persuade myself to make it a garrison of war war be a thing that i prefer to see as remote a may be have sufficiently merit popular kindness and so that it would be a hard matter justly to insult over me upon my own dunghill and i look upon it a a wonderful and exemplary thing that it yet continue a virgin from blood and plunder during so long a storm and so many neighbouring revolution and tumult for to confess the truth it have be possible enough for a man of my complexion to have shake hand with any one constant and continued form whatever but the contrary invasion and incursion alternation and vicissitude of fortune round about me have hitherto more exasperated than calm and mollify the temper of the country and involve me over and over again with invincible difficulty and danger i escape tis true but be trouble that it be more by chance and something of my own prudence than by justice and be not satisfy to be out of the protection of the law and under any other safeguard than theirs a matter stand i live above one half by the favour of other which be an untoward obligation i do not like to owe my safety either to the generosity or affection of great person who allow me my legality and my liberty or to the oblige manner of my predecessor or my own for what if i be another kind of man if my deportment and the frankness of my conversation or relationship oblige my neighbour tis that that they should acquit themselves of obligation in only permit me to live and they may say we allow him the free liberty of have divine service read in hi own private chapel when it be interdict in all church round about and allow him the use of hi good and hi life a one who protect our wife and cattle in time of need for my house have for many descent share in the reputation of lycurgus the athenian who be the general depository and guardian of the purse of hi fellowcitizens now i be clearly of opinion that a man should live by right and by authority and not either by recompense or favour how many gallant men have rather choose to lose their life than to be debtor for them i hate to subject myself to any sort of obligation but above all to that which bind me by the duty of honour i think nothing so dear a what have be give me and this because my will lie at pawn under the title of gratitude and more willingly accept of service that be to be sell i feel that for the last i give nothing but money but for the other i give myself the knot that bind me by the law of courtesy bind me more than that of civil constraint i be much more at ease when bound by a scrivener than by myself be it not reason that my conscience should be much more engaged when men simply rely upon it in a bond my faith owe nothing because it have nothing lent it let them trust to the security they have take without me i have much rather break the wall of a prison and the law themselves than my own word i be nice even to superstition in keep my promise and therefore upon all occasion have a care to make them uncertain and conditional to those of no great moment i add the jealousy of my own rule to make them weight it wrack and oppresses me with it own interest even in action wholly my own and free if i once say a thing i conceive that i have bind myself and that deliver it to the knowledge of another i have positively enjoin it my own performance methinks i promise it if i but say it and therefore be not apt to say much of that kind the sentence that i pass upon myself be more severe than that of a judge who only consider the common obligation but my conscience look upon it with a more severe and penetrate eye i lag in those duty to which i should be compel if i do not go if the action have not some splendour of liberty it have neither grace nor honour where necessity draw me i love to let my will take it own course i know some who follow this rule even to injustice who will sooner give than restore sooner lend than pay and will do them the least good to whom they be most obliged i dont go so far a that but im not far off i so much love to disengage and disobligate myself that i have sometimes look upon ingratitude affront and indignity which i have receive from those to whom either by nature or accident i be bind in some way of friendship a an advantage to me take this occasion of their illusage for an acquaintance and discharge of so much of my debt and though i still continue to pay them all the external office of public reason i notwithstanding find a great saving in do that upon the account of justice which i do upon the score of affection and be a little eased of the attention and solicitude of my inward will tis in me too urge and press where i take at least for a man who love not to be strain at all and this husband my friendship serve me for a sort of consolation in the imperfection of those in whom i be concerned i be very sorry they be not such a i could wish they be but then i also be spared somewhat of my application and engagement towards them i approve of a man who be the less fond of hi child for have a scald head or for be crook and not only when he be illconditioned but also when he be of unhappy disposition and imperfect in hi limbs god himself have abate so much from hi value and natural estimation provide he carry himself in this coldness of affection with moderation and exact justice proximity with me lessen not defect but rather aggravate them after all accord to what i understand in the science of benefit and acknowledgment which be a subtle science and of great use i know no person whatever more free and less indebted than i be at this hour what i do owe be simply to foreign obligation and benefit a to anything els no man be more absolutely clear prince give me a great deal if they take nothing from me and do me good enough if they do me no harm thats all i ask from them o how be i oblige to god that he have be please i should immediately receive from hi bounty all i have and specially reserve all my obligation to himself how earnestly do i beg of hi holy compassion that i may never owe essential thanks to any one o happy liberty wherein i have thus far live may it continue with me to the last i endeavour to have no express need of any one ti what every one may do in himself but more easily they whom god have place in a condition exempt from natural and urgent necessity it be a wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon other we ourselves in whom be ever the most just and safe dependence be not sufficiently sure i have nothing mine but myself and yet the possession be in part defective and borrow i fortify myself both in courage which be the strongest assistant and also in fortune therein wherewith to satisfy myself though everything els should forsake me hippias of elis not only furnish himself with knowledge that he might at need cheerfully retire from all other company to enjoy the mus nor only with the knowledge of philosophy to teach hi soul to be content with itself and bravely to subsist without outward convenience when fate would have it so he be moreover so careful a to learn to cook to shave himself to make hi own clothes hi own shoe and drawer to provide for all hi necessity in himself and to wean himself from the assistance of other a man more freely and cheerfully enjoy borrow convenience when it be not an enjoyment force and constrain by need and when he have in hi own will and fortune the mean to live without them i know myself very well but tis hard for me to imagine any so pure liberality of any one towards me any so frank and free hospitality that would not appear to me discreditable tyrannical and taint with reproach if necessity have reduce me to it a give be an ambitious and authoritative quality so be accept a quality of submission witness the insulting and quarrelsome refusal that bajazet make of the present that tamerlane send him and those that be offer on the part of the emperor solyman to the emperor of calicut so anger him that he not only rudely reject them say that neither he nor any of hi predecessor have ever be wont to take and that it be their office to give but moreover cause the ambassador send with the gift to be put into a dungeon when thetis say aristotle flatters jupiter when the lacedaemonians flatter the athenian they do not put them in mind of the good they have do them which be always odious but of the benefit they have receive from them such a i see so frequently employ every one in their affair and thrust themselves into so much obligation would never do it do they but relish a i do the sweetness of a pure liberty and do they but weigh a wise men should the burden of obligation ti sometimes peradventure fully pay but tis never dissolve ti a miserable slavery to a man who love to be at full liberty in all reapects such a know me both above and below me in station be able to say whether they have ever know a man less importuning solicit entreating and press upon other than i if i be so and a degree beyond all modern example ti no great wonder so many part of my manner contribute to it a little natural pride an impatience at be refuse the moderation of my desire and design my incapacity for business and my most beloved quality idleness and freedom by all these together i have conceive a mortal hatred to be oblige to any other or by any other than myself i leave no stone unturned to do without it rather than employ the bounty of another in any light or important occasion or necessity whatever my friends strangely trouble me when they ask me to ask a third person and i think it cost me little less to disengage him who be indebted to me by make use of him than to engage myself to him who owe me nothing these condition be remove and provide they require of me nothing if any great trouble or care for i have declare mortal war against all care i be very ready to do every one the best service i can i have be very willing to seek occasion to do people a good turn and to attach them to me and methinks there be no more agreeable employment for our mean but i have yet more avoid receiving than sought occasion of give and moreover accord to aristotle it be more easy my fortune have allow me but little to do other good withal and the little it can afford be put into a pretty close hand have i be bear a great person i should have be ambitious to have make myself beloved not to make myself fear or admire shall i more plainly express it i should more have endeavour to please than to profit other cyrus very wisely and by the mouth of a great captain and still great philosopher prefers hi bounty and benefit much before hi valour and warlike conquest and the elder scipio wherever he would raise himself in esteem set a high value upon hi affability and humanity than on hi prowess and victory and have always this glorious say in hi mouth that he have give hi enemy a much occasion to love him a hi friend i will then say that if a man must of necessity owe something it ought to be by a more legitimate title than that whereof i be speak to which the necessity of this miserable war compels me and not in so great a debt a that of my total preservation both of life and fortune it overwhelms me i have a thousand time go to bed in my own house with an apprehension that i should be betray and murder that very night compound with fortune that it might be without terror and with quick despatch and after my paternoster i have cry out what remedy tis the place of my birth and that of most of my ancestor they have here fix their affection and name we inure ourselves to whatever we be accustom to and in so miserable a condition a ours be custom be a great bounty of nature which benumb out sens to the sufferance of many evil a civil war have this with it bad than other war have to make u stand sentinel in our own house tis a grievous extremity for a man to be jostle even in hi own house and domestic repose the country where i live be always the first in arm and the last that lay them down and where there be never an absolute peace i sometimes extract the mean to fortify myself against these consideration from indifference and indolence which in some sort bring u on to resolution it often befall me to imagine and expect mortal danger with a kind of delight i stupidly plunge myself headlong into death without consider or take a view of it a into a deep and obscure abyss which swallow me up at one leap and involve me in an instant in a profound sleep without any sense of pain and in these short and violent death the consequence that i foresee administers more consolation to me than the effect do fear they say that a life be not well for be long so death be well for be not long i do not so much evade be dead a i enter into confidence with die i wrap and shroud myself into the storm that be to blind and carry me away with the fury of a sudden and insensible attack moreover if it should fall out that a some gardener say rose and violet spring more odoriferous near garlic and onion by reason that the last suck and imbibe all the ill odour of the earth so if these deprave nature should also attract all the malignity of my air and climate and render it so much good and purer by their vicinity i should not lose all that can not be but there may be something in this that goodness be more beautiful and attractive when it be rare and that contrariety and diversity fortify and consolidate welldoing within itself and inflame it by the jealousy of opposition and by glory thief and robber of their special favour have no particular spite at me no more have i to them i should have my hand too full like conscience be lodge under several sort of robe like cruelty disloyalty rapine and so much the bad and more falsely when the more secure and conceal under colour of the law i less hate an open profess injury than one that be treacherous an enemy in arm than an enemy in a gown our fever have seize upon a body that be not much the bad for it there be fire before and now tis break out into a flame the noise be great not the evil i ordinarily answer such a ask me the reason of my travel that i know very well what i fly from but not what i seek if they tell me that there may be a little soundness amongst foreigner and that their manner be no good than ours i first reply that it be hard to be believe secondly that it be always gain to change an ill condition for one that be uncertain and that the ill of other ought not to afflict u so much a our own i will not here omit that i never mutiny so much against france that i be not perfectly friends with paris that city have ever have my heart from my infancy and it have fall out a of excellent thing that the more beautiful city i have see since the more the beauty of this still win upon my affection i love her for herself and more in her own native be than in all the pomp of foreign and acquire embellishment i love her tenderly even to her wart and blemish i be a frenchman only through this great city great in people great in the felicity of her situation but above all great and incomparable in variety and diversity of commodity the glory of france and one of the most noble ornament of the world may god drive our division far from her entire and unite i think her sufficiently defend from all other violence i give her caution that of all sort of people those will be the bad that shall set her in discord i have no fear for her but of herself and certainly i have as much fear for her a for any other part of the kingdom whilst she shall continue i shall never want a retreat where i may stand at bay sufficient to make me amends for part with any other retreat not because socrates have say so but because it be in truth my own humour and peradventure not without some excess i look upon all men a my compatriot and embrace a poland a a frenchman prefer the universal and common tie to all national tie whatever i be not much take with the sweetness of a native air acquaintance wholly new and wholly my own appear to me full as good a the other common and fortuitous one with four neighbour friendship that be purely of our own acquire ordinarily carry it above those to which the communication of climate or of blood oblige u nature have place u in the world free and unbound we imprison ourselves in certain strait like the king of persia who oblige themselves to drink no other water but that of the river choaspes foolishly quit claim to their right in all other stream and so far a concerned themselves dry up all the other river of the world what socrates do towards hi end to look upon a sentence of banishment a bad than a sentence of death against him i shall i think never be either so decrepid or so strictly habituate to my own country to be of that opinion these celestial life have image enough that i embrace more by esteem than affection and they have some also so elevated and extraordinary that i can not embrace them so much a by esteem forasmuch a i can not conceive them that fancy be singular in a man who think the whole world hi city it be true that he disdain travel and have hardly ever set hi foot out of the attic territory what say you to hi complaint of the money hi friend offer to save hi life and that he refuse to come out of prison by the mediation of other in order not to disobey the law in a time when they be otherwise so corrupt these example be of the first kind for me of the second there be other that i could find out in the same person many of these rare example surpass the force of my action but some of them moreover surpass the force of my judgment besides these reason travel be in my opinion a very profitable exercise the soul be there continually employ in observe new and unknown thing and i do not know a i have often say a good school wherein to model life than by incessantly expose to it the diversity of so many other life fancy and usance and by make it relish a perpetual variety of form of human nature the body be therein neither idle nor overwrought and that moderate agitation put it in breath i can keep on horseback torment with the stone a i be without alight or be weary eight or ten hour together no season be enemy to me but the parching heat of a scorching sun for the umbrella make use of in italy ever since the time of the ancient roman more burden a man arm than they relieve hi head i would fain know how it be that the persian so long ago and in the infancy of luxury make ventilator where they want them and plant shade a xenophon report they do i love rain and to dabble in the dirt as well a duck do the change of air and climate never touch me every sky be alike i be only troubled with inward alteration which i breed within myself and those be not so frequent in travel i be hard to be get out but be once upon the road i hold out as well a the best i take as much pain in little a in great attempt and be as solicitous to equip myself for a short journey if but to visit a neighbour a for the long voyage i have learn to travel after the spanish fashion and to make but one stage of a great many mile and in excessive heat i always travel by night from sun set to sunrise the other method of baiting by the way in haste and hurry to gobble up a dinner be especially in short day very inconvenient my horse perform the good never any horse tire under me that be able to hold out the first day journey i water them at every brook i meet and have only a care they have so much way to go before i come to my inn a will digest the water in their belly my unwillingness to rise in a morning give my servant leisure to dine at their ease before they set out for my own part i never eat too late my appetite come to me in eat and not els i be never hungry but at table some of my friend blame me for continue this travel humour be marry and old but they be out int ti the best time to leave a man house when he have put it into a way of continue without him and settle such order a corresponds with it former government ti much great imprudence to abandon it to a less faithful housekeeper and who will be less solicitous to look after your affair the most useful and honourable knowledge and employment for the mother of a family be the science of good housewifery i see some that be covetous indeed but very few that be good manager tis the supreme quality of a woman which a man ought to seek before any other a the only dowry that must ruin or preserve our house let men say what they will accord to the experience i have learn i require in married woman the economical virtue above all other virtue i put my wife tot a a concern of her own leave her by my absence the whole government of my affair i see and be vex to see in several family i know monsieur about noon come home all jade and ruffle about hi affair when madame be still dress her hair and trick up herself forsooth in her closet this be for queen to do and thats a question too tis ridiculous and unjust that the laziness of our wife should be maintain with our sweat and labour no man so far a in me lie shall have a clear a more quiet and free fruition of hi estate than i if the husband bring matter nature herself will that the wife find the form a to the duty of conjugal friendship that some think to be impair by these absence i be quite of another opinion it be on the contrary an intelligence that easily cool by a too frequent and assiduous companionship every strange woman appear charm and we all find by experience that be continually together be not so please a to part for a time and meet again these interruption fill me with fresh affection towards my family and render my house more pleasant to me change warms my appetite to the one and then to the other i know that the arm of friendship be long enough to reach from the one end of the world to the other and especially this where there be a continual communication of office that rouse the obligation and remembrance the stoic say that there be so great connection and relation amongst the sage that he who din in france nourishes hi companion in egypt and that whoever do but hold out hi finger in what part of the world soever all the sage upon the habitable earth feel themselves assist by it fruition and possession principally appertain to the imagination it more fervently and constantly embrace what it be in quest of than what we hold in our arm cast up your daily amusement you will find that you be most absent from your friend when he be present with you hi presence relax your attention and give you liberty to absent yourself at every turn and upon every occasion when i be away at rome i keep and govern my house and the convenience i there leave see my wall rise my tree shoot and my revenue increase or decrease very near as well a when i be there if we enjoy nothing but what we touch we may say farewell to the money in our chest and to our son when they be go a hunting we will have them near to u be the garden or half a day journey from home far what be ten league far or near if near what be eleven twelve or thirteen and so by degree in earnest if there be a woman who can tell her husband what step end the near and what step begin the remote i would advise her to stop between and let them boldly call philosophy to their assistance in whose teeth it may be cast that see it neither discern the one nor the other end of the joint betwixt the too much and the little the long and the short the light and the heavy the near and the remote that see it discover neither the beginning nor the end it must need judge very uncertainly of the middle are they not still wife and friend to the dead who be not at the end of this but in the other world we embrace not only the absent but those who have be and those who be not yet we do not promise in marriage to be continually twist and link together like some little animal that we see or like the bewitched folk of karenty tie together like dog and a wife ought not to be so greedily enamour of her husband foreparts that she can not endure to see him turn hi back if occasion be but may not this saying of that excellent painter of woman humour be here introduce to show the reason of their complaint or may it not be that of itself opposition and contradiction entertain and nourish them and that they sufficiently accommodate themselves provide they incommodate you in true friendship wherein i be perfect i more give myself to my friend than i endeavour to attract him to me i be not only well please in do him service than if he confer a benefit upon me but moreover have rather he should do himself good than me and he most obliges me when he do so and if absence be either more pleasant or convenient for him ti also more acceptable to me than hi presence neither be it properly absence when we can write to one another i have sometimes make good use of our separation from one another we good fill and far extend the possession of life in be part he live enjoyed and saw for me and i for him as fully a if he have himself be there one part of u remain idle and we be too much blend in one another when we be together the distance of place render the conjunction of our will more rich this insatiable desire of personal presence a little implies weakness in the fruition of soul a to what concern age which be allege against me tis quite contrary ti for youth to subject itself to common opinion and to curb itself to please other it have wherewithal to please both the people and itself we have but too much ado to please ourselves alone a natural convenience fail let u supply them with those that be artificial ti injustice to excuse youth for pursue it pleasure and to forbid old men to seek them when young i conceal my wanton passion with prudence now i be old i chase away melancholy by debauch and thus do the platonic law forbid men to travel till forty or fifty year old so that travel might be more useful and instructive in so mature an age i should sooner subscribe to the second article of the same law which forbid it after threescore but at such an age you will never return from so long a journey what care i for that i neither undertake it to return nor to finish it my business be only to keep myself in motion whilst motion plea me i only walk for the walk sake they who run after a benefit or a hare run not they only run who run at base and to exercise their running my design be divisible throughout it be not ground upon any great hope every day conclude my expectation and the journey of my life be carry on after the same manner and yet i have see place enough a great way off where i could have wish to have stay and why not if chrysippus cleanthes diogenes zeno antipater so many sage of the sour sect readily abandon their country without occasion of complaint and only for the enjoyment of another air in earnest that which most displeases me in all my travel be that i can not resolve to settle my abode where i should best like but that i must always propose to myself to return to accommodate myself to the common humour if i fear to die in any other place than that of my birth if i think i should die more uneasily remote from my own family i should hardly go out of france i should not without fear step out of my parish i feel death always pinch me by the throat or by the back but i be otherwise constitute ti in all place alike to me yet might i have my choice i think i should rather choose to die on horseback than in bed out of my own house and far from my own people there be more heartbreaking than consolation in take leave of one friend i be willing to omit that civility for that of all the office of friendship be the only one that be unpleasant and i could with all my heart dispense with that great and eternal farewell if there be any convenience in so many standersby it bring an hundred inconvenience along with it i have see many die miserably surround with all this train ti a crowd that choke them ti against duty and be a testimony of little kindness and little care to permit you to die in repose one torment your eye another your ear another your tongue you have neither sense nor member that be not worry by them your heart be wound with compassion to hear the mourning of friend and perhaps with anger to hear the counterfeit condolings of pretender who ever have be delicate and sensitive when well be much more so when ill in such a necessity a gentle hand be require accommodated to hi sentiment to scratch him just in the place where he itch otherwise scratch him not at all if we stand in need of a wise woman to bring u into the world we have much more need of a still wise man to help u out of it such a one and a friend to boot a man ought to purchase at any cost for such an occasion i be not yet arrive to that pitch of disdainful vigour that be fortify in itself that nothing can assist or disturb i be of a low form i endeavour to hide myself and to escape from this passage not by fear but by art i do not intend in this act of die to make proof and show of my constancy for whom should i do it all the right and interest i have in reputation will then cease i content myself with a death involve within itself quiet solitary and all my own suitable to my retired and private life quite contrary to the roman superstition where a man be look upon a unhappy who die without speaking and who have not hi near relation to close hi eye i have enough to do to comfort myself without have to console other thought enough in my head not to need that circumstance should possess me with new and matter enough to occupy me without borrow this affair be out of the part of society ti the act of one single person let u live and be merry amongst our friend let u go repine and die amongst stranger a man may find those for hi money who will shift hi pillow and rub hi foot and will trouble him no more than he would have them who will present to him an indifferent countenance and suffer him to govern himself and to complain accord to hi own method i wean myself daily by my reason from this childish and inhuman humour of desire by our suffering to move the compassion and mourning of our friend we stretch our own incommodities beyond their just extent when we extract tear from other and the constancy which we commend in every one in support hi adverse fortune we accuse and reproach in our friend when the evil be our own we be not satisfy that they should be sensible of our condition only unless they be moreover afflict a man should diffuse joy but as much a he can smother grief he who make himself lament without reason be a man not to be lament when there shall be real cause to be always complain be the way never to be lament by make himself always in so pitiful a taking he be never commiserate by any he who make himself out dead when he be alive be subject to be think live when he be die i have see some who have take it ill when they have be tell that they look well and that their pulse be good restrain their smile because they betray a recovery and be angry at their health because it be not to be lament and which be a great deal more these be not woman i describe my infirmity such a they really be at most and avoid all expression of evil prognostic and composed exclamation if not mirth at least a temperate countenance in the standersby be proper in the presence of a wise sick man he do not quarrel with health for see himself in a contrary condition he be pleased to contemplate it sound and entire in other and at least to enjoy it for company he do not for feel himself melt away abandon all living thought nor avoid ordinary discourse i would study sickness whilst i be well when it have seize me it will make it impression real enough without the help of my imagination we prepare ourselves beforehand for the journey we undertake and resolve upon them we leave the appointment of the hour when to take horse to the company and in their favour defer it i find this unexpected advantage in the publication of my manner that it in some sort serf me for a rule i have at time some consideration of not betray the history of my life this public declaration oblige me to keep my way and not to give the lie to the image i have draw of my quality commonly less deformed and contradictory than consist with the malignity and infirmity of the judgment of this age the uniformity and simplicity of my manner produce a face of easy interpretation but because the fashion be a little new and not in use it give too great opportunity to slander yet so it be that whoever would fairly assail me i think i so sufficiently assist hi purpose in my known and avow imperfection that he may that way satisfy hi illnature without fight with the wind if i myself to anticipate accusation and discovery confess enough to frustrate hi malice a he conceive ti but reason that he make use of hi right of amplification and to wiredraw my vice as far a he can attack have it right beyond justice and let him make the root of those error i have lay open to him shoot up into tree let him make hi use not only of those i be really affected with but also of those that only threaten me injurious vice both in quality and number let him cudgel me that way i should willingly follow the example of the philosopher bion antigonus be about to reproach him with the meanness of hi birth he presently cut him short with this declaration i be say he the son of a slave a butcher and brand and of a strumpet my father marry in the low of hi fortune both of them be whip for offence they have commit an orator buy me when a child and find me a pretty and hopeful boy breed me up and when he die leave me all hi estate which i have transport into this city of athens and here settle myself to the study of philosophy let the historian never trouble themselves with inquire about me i will tell them about it a free and generous confession enervate reproach and disarms slander so it be that one thing with another i fancy men a often commend a undervalue me beyond reason a methinks also from my childhood in rank and degree of honour they have give me a place rather above than below my right i should find myself more at ease in a country where these degree be either regulate or not regarded amongst men when an altercation about the precedence either of walking or sit exceeds three reply tis repute uncivil i never stick at give or take place out of rule to avoid the trouble of such ceremony and never any man have a mind to go before me but i permit him to do it besides this profit i make of writing of myself i have also hop for this other advantage that if it should fall out that my humour should please or jump with those of some honest man before i die he would then desire and seek to be acquaint with me i have give him a great deal of madeway for all that he could have in many year acquire by close familiarity he have see in three day in this memorial and more surely and exactly a pleasant fancy many thing that i would not confess to any one in particular i deliver to the public and send my best friend to a bookseller shop there to inform themselves concern my most secret thought did i by good direction know where to seek any one proper for my conversation i should certainly go a great way to find him out for the sweetness of suitable and agreeable company can not in my opinion be buy too dear o what a thing be a true friend how true be that old say that the use of a friend be more pleasing and necessary than the element of water and fire to return to my subject there be then no great harm in die privately and far from home we conceive ourselves oblige to retire for natural action less unseemly and less terrible than this but moreover such a be reduce to spin out a long languishing life ought not perhaps to wish to trouble a great family with their continual misery therefore the indian in a certain province think it just to knock a man on the head when reduce to such a necessity and in another of their province they all forsake him to shift for himself as well a he could to whom do they not at last become tedious and insupportable the ordinary office of fife do not go that length you teach your best friend to be cruel perforce harden wife and child by long use neither to regard nor to lament your suffering the groan of the stone be grow so familiar to my people that nobody take any notice of them and though we should extract some pleasure from their conversation which do not always happen by reason of the disparity of condition which easily beget contempt or envy toward any one whatever be it not too much to make abuse of this half a lifetime the more i should see them constrain themselves out of affection to be serviceable to me the more i should be sorry for their pain we have liberty to lean but not to lay our whole weight upon other so a to prop ourselves by their ruin like him who cause little children throat to be cut to make use of their blood for the cure of a disease he have or that other who be continually supply with tender young girl to keep hi old limbs warm in the night and to mix the sweetness of their breath with hi sour and stink i should readily advise venice a a retreat in this decline of life decrepitude be a solitary quality i be sociableeven to excess yet i think it reasonable that i should now withdraw my trouble from the sight of the world and keep them to myself let me shrink and draw up myself in my own shell like a tortoise and learn to see men without hang upon them i should endanger them in so slippery a passage ti time to turn my back to company but in these travel you will be take ill in some wretched place where nothing can be have to relieve you i always carry most thing necessary about me and besides we can not evade fortune if she once resolve to attack u i need nothing extraordinary when i be sick i will not be behold to my bolus to do that for me which nature can not at the very beginning of my fever and sickness that cast me down whilst still entire and but little disordered in health i reconcile myself to almighty god by the last christian office and find myself by so do less oppressed and more easy and have get methinks so much the good of my disease and i have yet less need of a notary or counsellor than of a physician what i have not settle of my affair when i be in health let no one expect i should do it when i be sick what i will do for the service of death be always do i durst not so much a one day defer it and if nothing be do ti as much a to say either that doubt hinder my choice and sometimes tis well choose not to choose or that i be positively resolve not to do anything at all i write my book for few men and for few year have it be matter of duration i should have put it into firm language accord to the continual variation that ours have be subject to up to this day who can expect that it present form should be in use fifty year hence it slip every day through our finger and since i be bear it be alter above onehalf we say that it be now perfect and every age say the same of it own i shall hardly trust to that so long a it vary and change a it do ti for good and useful writing to rivet it to them and it reputation will go accord to the fortune of our state for which reason i be not afraid to insert in it several private article which will spend their use amongst the men that be now live and that concern the particular knowledge of some who will see far into them than every common reader i will not after all a i often hear dead men speak of that men should say of me he judge he live so and so he would have do this or that could he have speak when he be die he would have say so or so and have give this thing or tother i know him good than any now as much a decency permit i here discover my inclination and affection but i do more willingly and freely by word of mouth to any one who desire to be inform so it be that in these memoir if any one observe he will find that i have either tell or design to tell all what i can not express i point out with my finger i leave nothing to be desire or to be guess at concern me if people must be talk of me i would have it to be justly and truly i would come again with all my heart from the other world to give any one the lie who should report me other than i be though he do it to honour me i perceive that people represent even live men quite another thing than what they really be and have i not stoutly defend a friend whom i have lose they would have tear him into a thousand contrary piece to conclude the account of my poor humour i confess that in my travel i seldom reach my inn but that it come into my mind to consider whether i could there be sick and die at my ease i desire to be lodge in some private part of the house remote from all noise ill scent and smoke i endeavour to flatter death by these frivolous circumstance or to say good to discharge myself from all other incumbrance that i may have nothing to do nor be trouble with anything but that which will lie heavy enough upon me without any other load i would have my death share in the ease and convenience of my life ti a great part of it and of great importance and i hope it will not in the future contradict the past death have some form that be more easy than other and receive diver quality accord to every one fancy amongst the natural death that which proceeds from weakness and stupor i think the most favourable amongst those that be violent i can worse endure to think of a precipice than of the fall of a house that will crush me in a moment and of a wound with a sword than of a harquebus shot i should rather have choose to poison myself with socrates than stab myself with cato and though it be all one yet my imagination make as great a difference a betwixt death and life betwixt throw myself into a burning furnace and plunging into the channel of a river so idly do our fear more concern itself in the mean than the effect it be but an instant ti true but withal an instant of such weight that i would willingly give a great many day of my life to pass it over after my own fashion since every one imagination render it more or less terrible and since every one have some choice amongst the several form of die let u try a little further to find some one that be wholly clear from all offence might not one render it even voluptuous like the commoyientes of antony and cleopatra i set aside the brave and exemplary effort produce by philosophy and religion but amongst men of little mark there have be find some such a petronius and tigellinus at rome condemn to despatch themselves who have a it be rock death asleep with the delicacy of their preparation they have make it slip and steal away in the height of their accustomed diversion amongst girl and good fellow not a word of consolation no mention of make a will no ambitious affectation of constancy no talk of their future condition amongst sport feasting wit and mirth common and indifferent discourse music and amorous verse be it not possible for u to imitate this resolution after a more decent manner since there be death that be good for fools death good for the wise let u find out such a be fit for those who be betwixt both my imagination suggest to me one that be easy and since we must die to be desire the roman tyrant think they do in a manner give a criminal life when they give him the choice of hi death but be not theophrastus that so delicate so modest and so wise a philosopher compel by reason when he durst say this verse translate by cicero fortune assist the facility of the bargain of my life have place it in such a condition that for the future it can be neither advantage nor hindrance to those who be concern in me tis a condition that i would have accept at any time of my life but in this occasion of truss up my baggage i be particularly pleased that in die i shall neither do them good nor harm she have so order it by a cunning compensation that they who may pretend to any considerable advantage by my death will at the same time sustain a material inconvenience death sometimes be more grievous to u in that it be grievous to other and interest u in their interest as much a in our own and sometimes more in this conveniency of lodge that i desire i mix nothing of pomp and amplitude i hate it rather but a certain plain neatness which be oftenest find in place where there be less of art and that nature have adorn with some grace that be all her own and besides ti for those whose affair compel them to travel in the depth of winter through the grison country to be surprise upon the way with great inconvenience i who for the most part travel for my pleasure do not order my affair so ill if the way be foul on my right hand i turn on my left if i find myself unfit to ride i stay where i be and so do in earnest i see nothing that be not a pleasant and commodious a my own house ti true that i always find superfluity superfluous and observe a kind of trouble even in abundance itself have i leave anything behind me unseen i go back to see it ti still on my way i trace no certain line either straight or crooked do i not find in the place to which i go what be report to me a it often fall out that the judgment of other do not jump with mine and that i have find their report for the most part false i never complain of lose my labour i have at least informed myself that what be tell me be not true i have a constitution of body a free and a palate as indifferent a any man live the diversity of manner of several nation only affect me in the pleasure of variety every usage have it reason let the plate and dish be pewter wood or earth my meat be boil or roast let them give me butter or oil of nut or olive hot or cold ti all one to me and so indifferent that grow old i accuse this generous faculty and would wish that delicacy and choice should correct the indiscretion of my appetite and sometimes soothe my stomach when i have be abroad out of france and that people out of courtesy have ask me if i would be serve after the french manner i laugh at the question and always frequent table the most fill with foreigner i be ashamed to see our countryman besotted with this foolish humour of quarrel with form contrary to their own they seem to be out of their element when out of their own village wherever they go they keep to their own fashion and abominate those of stranger do they meet with a compatriot in hungary o the happy chance they be henceforward inseparable they cling together and their whole discourse be to condemn the barbarous manner they see about them why barbarous because they be not french and those have make the best use of their travel who have observe most to speak against most of them go for no other end but to come back again they proceed in their travel with vast gravity and circumspection with a silent and incommunicable prudence preserve themselves from the contagion of an unknown air what i be say of them put me in mind of something like it i have at time observe in some of our young courtier they will not mix with any but men of their own sort and look upon u a men of another world with disdain or pity put them upon any discourse but the intrigue of the court and they be utterly at a loss a very owls and novice to u a we be to them ti truly say that a wellbred man be a compound man i on the contrary travel very much sate with our own fashion i do not look for gascons in sicily i have leave enough of them at home i rather seek for greek and persian they be the men i endeavour to be acquaint with and the men i study tis there that i bestow and employ myself and which be more i fancy that i have meet but with few custom that be not as good a our own i have not i confess travelled very far scarce out of the sight of the vane of my own house a to the rest most of the accidental company a man fall into upon the road beget him more trouble than pleasure i waive them as much a i civilly can especially now that age seem in some sort to privilege and sequester me from the common form you suffer for other or other suffer for you both of them inconvenience of importance enough but the latter appear to me the great ti a rare fortune but of inestimable solace to have a worthy man one of a sound judgment and of manner conformable to your own who take a delight to bear you company i have be at an infinite loss for such upon my travel but such a companion should be choose and acquire from your first set out there can be no pleasure to me without communication there be not so much a a sprightly think come into my mind that it do not grieve me to have produce alone and that i have no one to communicate it to this other have strain it one note high architas plea me when he say that it would be unpleasant even in heaven itself to wander in those great and divine celestial body without a companion but yet tis much good to be alone than in foolish and troublesome company aristippus love to live a a stranger in all place i should choose to pass away the great part of my life on horseback have you not more easy diversion at home what do you there want be not your house situate in a sweet and healthful air sufficiently furnish and more than sufficiently large ha not the royal majesty be more than once there entertain with all it train be there not more below your family in good ease than there be above it in eminence is there any local extraordinary indigestible thought that afflict you where do you think to live without disturbance you see then it be only you that trouble yourself you will everywhere follow yourself and everywhere complain for there be no satisfaction here below but either for brutish or for divine soul he who on so just an occasion have no contentment where will he think to find it how many thousand of men terminate their wish in such a condition a yours do but reform yourself for that be wholly in your own power whereas you have no other right but patience towards fortune i see the reason of this advice and see it perfectly well but he might sooner have do and more pertinently in bid me in one word be wise that resolution be beyond wisdom ti her precise work and product thus the physician keep preach to a poor languishing patient to be cheerful but he would advise him a little more discreetly in bidding him be well for my part i be but a man of the common sort ti a wholesome precept certain and easy to be understood be content with what you have that be to say with reason and yet to follow this advice be no more in the power of the wise men of the world than in me tis a common say but of a terrible extent what do it not comprehend all thing fall under discretion and qualification i know very well that to take it by the letter this pleasure of travelling be a testimony of uneasiness and irresolution and in sooth these two be our governing and predominate quality yes i confess i see nothing not so much a in a dream in a wish whereon i could set up my rest variety only and the possession of diversity can satisfy me that be if anything can in travel it please me that i may stay where i like without inconvenience and that i have a place wherein commodiously to divert myself i love a private life because ti my own choice that i love it not by any dissent from or dislike of public life which peradventure be as much accord to my complexion i serve my prince more cheerfully because it be by the free election of my own judgment and reason without any particular obligation and that i be not reduce and constrain so to do for be reject or dislike by the other party and so of all the rest i hate the morsel that necessity carve me any commodity upon which i have only to depend would have me by the throat one cord will never hold me fast enough you will say there be vanity in this way of living but where be there not all these fine precept be vanity and all wisdom be vanity these exquisite subtlety be only fit for sermon they be discourse that will send u all saddle into the other world life be a material and corporal motion an action imperfect and irregular of it own proper essence i make it my business to serve it accord to itself to what end be these elevated point of philosophy upon which no human be can rely and those rule that exceed both our use and force i see often that we have theory of life set before u which neither the proposer nor those who hear him have any hope nor which be more any inclination to follow of the same sheet of paper whereon the judge have but just write a sentence against an adulterer he steal a piece whereon to write a loveletter to hi companion wife she whom you have but just now illicitly embrace will presently even in your hearing more loudly inveigh against the same fault in her companion than a portia would do and men there be who will condemn other to death for crime that they themselves do not repute so much a fault i have in my youth see a man of good rank with one hand present to the people verse that excel both in wit and debauchery and with the other at the same time the most ripe and pugnacious theological reformation that the world have be treat withal these many year and so men proceed we let the law and precept follow their way ourselves keep another course not only from debauchery of manner but ofttimes by judgment and contrary opinion do but hear a philosophical lecture the invention eloquence pertinency immediately strike upon your mind and move you there be nothing that touch or sting your conscience ti not to this they address themselves be not this true it make aristo say that neither a bath nor a lecture do aught unless it scour and make men clean one may stop at the skin but it be after the marrow be pick out a after we have swallow good wine out of a fine cup we examine the design and workmanship in all the court of ancient philosophy this be to be find that the same teacher publishes rule of temperance and at the same time lesson in love and wantonness xenophon in the very bosom of clinias write against the aristippic virtue ti not that there be any miraculous conversion in it that make them thus waver ti that solon represent himself sometimes in hi own person and sometimes in that of a legislator one while he speak for the crowd and another for himself take the free and natural rule for hi own share feel assure of a firm and entire health antisthenes allow a sage to love and to do whatever he think convenient without regard to the law forasmuch a he be well advise than they and have a great knowledge of virtue hi disciple diogenes say that men to perturbation be to oppose reason to fortune courage to the law nature for tender stomach constrain and artificial recipe must be prescribe good and strong stomach serve themselves simply with the prescription of their own natural appetite after this manner do our physician proceed who eat melon and drink iced wine whilst they confine their patient to syrup and sop i know not say the courtezan lais what they may talk of book wisdom and philosophy but these men knock a often at my door a any other at the same rate that our licence carry u beyond what be lawful and allow men have often beyond universal reason stretch the precept and rule of our life it be to be wish that there be more proportion betwixt the command and the obedience and the mark seem to be unjust to which one can not attain there be no so good man who so square all hi thought and action to the law that he be not faulty enough to deserve hang ten time in hi life and he may well be such a one a it be great injustice and great harm to punish and ruin and such an one there may be who have no way offend the law who nevertheless would not deserve the character of a virtuous man and whom philosophy would justly condemn to be whip so unequal and perplexed be this relation we be so far from be good men accord to the law of god that we can not be so accord to our own human wisdom never yet arrive at the duty it have itself prescribe and could it arrive there it would still prescribe to itself other beyond to which it would ever aspire and pretend so great an enemy to consistency be our human condition man enjoin himself to be necessarily in fault he be not very discreet to cut out hi own duty by the measure of another be than hi own to whom do he prescribe that which he do not expect any one should perform be he unjust in not do what it be impossible for him to do the law which condemn u not to be able condemn u for not be able at the bad this difform liberty of present ourselves two several way the action after one manner and the reasoning after another may be allow to those who only speak of thing but it can not be allow to those who speak of themselves a i do i must march my pen a i do my foot common life ought to have relation to the other live the virtue of cato be vigorous beyond the reason of the age he live in and for a man who make it hi business to govern other a man dedicate to the public service it might be call a justice if not unjust at least vain and out of season even my own manner which differ not above an inch from those current amongst u render me nevertheless a little rough and unsociable at my age i know not whether it be without reason that i be disgust with the world i frequent but i know very well that it would be without reason should i complain of it be disgust with me see i be so with it the virtue that be assign to the affair of the world be a virtue of many waving corner and elbow to join and adapt itself to human frailty mixed and artificial not straight clear constant nor purely innocent our annals to this very day reproach one of our king for suffer himself too simply to be carry away by the conscientious persuasion of hi confessor affair of state have bolder precept i formerly try to employ in the service of public affair opinion and rule of living a rough new unpolished or unpolluted a they be either bear with me or bring away from my education and wherewith i serve my own turn if not so commodiously at least securely in my own particular concern a scholastic and novice virtue but i have find them unapt and dangerous he who go into a crowd must now go one way and then another keep hi elbow close retire or advance and quit the straight way accord to what he encounter and must live not so much accord to hi own method a to that of other not accord to what he propose to himself but accord to what be propose to him accord to the time accord to the men accord to the occasion plato say that whoever escape from the world handle with clean breech escape by miracle and say withal that when he appoint hi philosopher the head of a government he do not mean a corrupt one like that of athens and much less such a one a this of ours wherein wisdom itself would be to seek a good herb transplant into a soil contrary to it own nature much sooner conforms itself to the soil than it reform the soil to it i find that if i have wholly to apply myself to such employment it would require a great deal of change and new modelling in me before i could be any way fit for it and though i could so far prevail upon myself and why might i not with time and diligence work such a feat i would not do it the little trial i have have of public employment have be so much disgust to me i feel at time temptation toward ambition rise in my soul but i obstinately oppose them i be seldom call to it and a seldom offer myself uncalled liberty and laziness the quality most predominant in me be quality diametrically contrary to that trade we can not well distinguish the faculty of men they have division and limit hard and delicate to choose to conclude from the discreet conduct of a private life a capacity for the management of public affair be to conclude ill a man may govern himself well who can not govern other so and compose essay who could not work effect men there may be who can order a siege well who would ill marshal a battle who can speak well in private who would ill harangue a people or a prince nay ti peradventure rather a testimony in him who can do the one that he can not do the other than otherwise i find that elevated soul be not much more proper for mean thing than mean soul be for high one could it be imagine that socrates should have administer occasion of laughter at the expense of hi own reputation to the athenian for have never be able to sum up the vote of hi tribe to deliver it to the council truly the veneration i have for the perfection of this great man deserve that hi fortune should furnish for the excuse of my principal imperfection so magnificent an example our sufficiency be cut out into small parcel mine have no latitude and be also very contemptible in number saturninus to those who have confer upon him the command in chief companion say he you have lose a good captain to make of him a bad general whoever boast in so sick a time a this to employ a true and sincere virtue in the world service either know not what it be opinion grow corrupt with manner and in truth to hear them describe it to hear the most of them glorify themselves in their deportment and lay down their rule instead of paint virtue they paint pure vice and injustice and so represent it false in the education of prince or if he do know it boast unjustly and let him say what he will do a thousand thing of which hi own conscience must necessarily accuse him i should willingly take seneca word on the experience he make upon the like occasion provide he would deal sincerely with me the most honourable mark of goodness in such a necessity be freely to confess both one own fault and those of other with the power of it virtue to stay one inclination towards evil unwillingly to follow this propension to hope good to desire good i perceive that in these division wherein we be involve in france every one labour to defend hi cause but even the very best of them with dissimulation and disguise he who would write roundly of the true state of the quarrel would write rashly and wrongly the most just party be at best but a member of a decayed and wormeaten body but of such a body the member that be least affected call itself sound and with good reason forasmuch a our quality have no title but in comparison civil innocence be measure accord to time and place imagine this in xenophon relate a a fine commendation of agesilaus that be entreat by a neighbouring prince with whom he have formerly have war to permit him to pass through hi country he grant hi request give him free passage through peloponnesus and not only do not imprison or poison him be at hi mercy but courteously receive him accord to the obligation of hi promise without do him the least injury or offence to such idea a theirs this be an act of no especial note elsewhere and in another age the frankness and unanimity of such an action would be think wonderful our monkeyish capet would have laugh at it so little do the spartan innocence resemble that of france we be not without virtuous men but ti accord to our notion of virtue whoever have hi manner establish in regularity above the standard of the age he live in let him either wrest or blunt hi rule or which i would rather advise him to let him retire and not meddle with u at all what will he get by it one may regret good time but can not fly from the present we may wish for other magistrate but we must notwithstanding obey those we have and peradventure ti more laudable to obey the bad than the good so long a the image of the ancient and receive law of this monarchy shall shine in any corner of the kingdom there will i be if they unfortunately happen to thwart and contradict one another so a to produce two part of doubtful and difficult choice i will willingly choose to withdraw and escape the tempest in the meantime nature or the hazard of war may lend me a help hand betwixt caesar and pompey i should frankly have declare myself but a amongst the three robber who come after a man must have be necessitate either to hide himself or have go along with the current of the time which i think one may fairly do when reason no longer guide this medley be a little from my theme i go out of my way but ti rather by licence than oversight my fancy follow one another but sometimes at a great distance and look towards one another but ti with an oblique glance i have read a dialogue of plato of the like motley and fantastic composition the begin about love and all the rest to the end about rhetoric they fear not these variation and have a marvellous grace in let themselves be carry away at the pleasure of the wind or at least to seem a if they be the title of my chapter do not always comprehend the whole matter they often denote it by some mark only a these other andria eunuchus or these sylla cicero toyquatus i love a poetic progress by leap and skip tis an art a plato say light nimble demoniac there be piece in plutarch where he forget hi theme where the proposition of hi argument be only find by incidence stuffed and half stifle in foreign matter observe hi footstep in the daemon of socrates o god how beautiful be these frolicsome sally those variation and digression and all the more when they seem most fortuitous and careless ti the indiligent reader who lose my subject and not i there will always be find some word or other in a corner that be to the purpose though it lie very close i ramble indiscreetly and tumultuously my style and my wit wander at the same rate he must fool it a little who would not be deem wholly a fool say both the precept and still more the example of our master a thousand poet flag and languish after a prosaic manner but the best old prose and i strew it here up and down indifferently for verse shine throughout with the lustre vigour and boldness of poetry and not without some air of it fury and certainly prose ought to have the preeminence in speak the poet say plato seat upon the mus tripod pour out with fury whatever come into hi mouth like the pipe of a fountain without consider and weigh it and thing escape him of various colour of contrary substance and with an irregular torrent plato himself be throughout poetical and the old theology a the learn tell u be all poetry and the first philosophy be the original language of the god i would have my matter distinguish itself it sufficiently show where it change where it conclude where it begin and where it rejoin without interlace it with word of connection introduce for the relief of weak or negligent ear and without explain myself who be he that have not rather not be read at all than after a drowsy or cursory manner if to take book in hand be to learn them to look upon them be to consider them and to run these slightly over be to grasp them i be then to blame to make myself out so ignorant a i say i be see i can not fix the attention of my reader by the weight of what i write manco male if i should chance to do it by my intricacy nay but he will afterwards repent that he ever perplex himself about it ti very true but he will yet be there perplexed and besides there be some humour in which comprehension produce disdain who will think good of me for not understand what i say and will conclude the depth of my sense by it obscurity which to speak in good sooth i mortally hate and would avoid it if i could aristotle boast somewhere in hi writing that he affect it a vicious affectation the frequent break into chapter that i make my method in the beginning of my book have since seem to me to dissolve the attention before it be raise a make it disdain to settle itself to so little i upon that account have make them longer such a require proposition and assigned leisure in such an employment to whom you will not give an hour you give nothing and you do nothing for him for whom you only do it whilst you be do something els to which may be add that i have peradventure some particular obligation to speak only by half to speak confusedly and discordantly i be therefore angry at this troublefeast reason and it extravagant project that worry one life and it opinion so fine and subtle though they be all true i think too dear buy and too inconvenient on the contrary i make it my business to bring vanity itself in repute and folly too if it produce me any pleasure and let myself follow my own natural inclination without carry too strict a hand upon them i have see elsewhere house in ruin and statue both of god and men these be men still ti all true and yet for all that i can not so often revisit the tomb of that so great and so puissant city that i do not admire and reverence it the care of the dead be recommend to u now i have be breed up from my infancy with these dead i have knowledge of the affair of rome long before i have any of those of my own house i know the capitol and it plan before i know the louvre and the tiber before i know the seine the quality and fortune of lucullus metellus and scipio have ever run more in my head than those of any of my own country they be all dead so be my father a absolutely dead a they and be remove a far from me and life in eighteen year a they be in sixteen hundred whose memory nevertheless friendship and society i do not cease to embrace and utilise with a perfect and lively union nay of my own inclination i pay more service to the dead they can no longer help themselves and therefore methinks the more require my assistance ti there that gratitude appear in it full lustre the benefit be not so generously bestow where there be retrogradation and reflection arcesilaus go to visit ctesibius who be sick and find him in a very poor condition very finely convey some money under hi pillow and by conceal it from him acquit him moreover from the acknowledgment due to such a benefit such a have merit from me friendship and gratitude have never lose these by be no more i have good and more carefully pay them when go and ignorant of what i do i speak most affectionately of my friend when they can no longer know it i have have a hundred quarrel in defend pompey and for the cause of brutus this acquaintance yet continue betwixt u we have no other hold even on present thing but by fancy find myself of no use to this age i throw myself back upon that other and be so enamoured of it that the free just and flourish state of that ancient rome for i neither love it in it birth nor it old age interest and impassionates me and therefore i can not so often revisit the site of their street and house and those ruin profound even to the antipode that i be not interested in them be it by nature or through error of fancy that the sight of place which we know to have be frequent and inhabit by person whose memory be recommend in story move u in some sort more than to hear a recital of their act or to read their writing it please me to consider their face bearing and vestment i pronounce those great name betwixt my teeth and make them ring in my ear of thing that be in some part great and admirable i admire even the common part i could wish to see them in familiar relation walk and sup it be ingratitude to contemn the relic and image of so many worthy and valiant men a i have see live and die and who by their example give u so many good instruction know we how to follow them and moreover this very rome that we now see deserves to be beloved so long and by so many title ally to our crown the only common and universal city the sovereign magistrate that command there be equally acknowledge elsewhere tis the metropolitan city of all the christian nation the spaniard and frenchman be there at home to be a prince of that state there need no more but to be of christendom wheresoever there be no place upon earth that heaven have embrace with such an influence and constancy of favour her very ruin be grand and glorious she yet in her very tomb retain the mark and image of empire some would blame and be angry at themselves to perceive themselves tickle with so vain a pleasure our humour be never too vain that be pleasant let them be what they may if they constantly content a man of common understanding i could not have the heart to blame him i be very much oblige to fortune in that to this very hour she have offer me no outrage beyond what i be well able to bear is it not her custom to let those live in quiet by whom she be not importune if she continue her favour she will dismiss me very well satisfied but beware a shock there be a thousand who perish in the port i easily comfort myself for what shall here happen when i shall be go present thing trouble me enough besides i have not that strong obligation that they say tie men to the future by the issue that succeed to their name and honour and peradventure ought less to covet them if they be to be so much desire i be but too much tie to the world and to this life of myself i be content to be in fortune power by circumstance properly necessary to my be without otherwise enlarge her jurisdiction over me and have never think that to be without child be a defect that ought to render life less complete or less content a sterile vocation have it convenience too child be of the number of thing that be not so much to be desire especially now that it would be so hard to make them good and yet they be justly to be lament by such a lose them when they have them he who leave me my house in charge foretell that i be like to ruin it consider my humour so little inclined to look after household affair but he be mistake for i be in the same condition now a when i first enter into it or rather somewhat good and yet without office or any place of profit a to the rest if fortune have never do me any violent or extraordinary injury neither have she do me any particular favour whatever we derive from her bounty be there above a hundred year before my time i have a to my own particular no essential and solid good that i stand indebted for to her liberality she have indeed do me some airy favour honorary and titular favour without substance and those in truth she have not grant but offer me who god know be all material and who take nothing but what be real and indeed massive too for current pay and who if i durst confess so much should not think avarice much less excusable than ambition nor pain less to be avoid than shame nor health less to be covet than learn or rich than nobility amongst those empty favour of hers there be none that so much plea vain humour natural to my country a an authentic bull of a roman burgessship that be grant me when i be last there glorious in seal and gild letter and grant with all gracious liberality and because ti couch in a mixt style more or less favourable and that i could have be glad to have see a copy of it before it have pass the seal being before burgess of no city at all i be glad to be create one of the most noble that ever be or ever shall be if other men would consider themselves at the rate i do they would a i do discover themselves to be full of inanity and foppery to rid myself of it i can not without make myself away we be all steep in it as well one a another but they who be not aware ont have somewhat the good bargain and yet i know not whether they have or no this opinion and common usage to observe other more than ourselves have very much relieve u that way ti a very displeasing object we can there see nothing but misery and vanity nature that we may not be deject with the sight of our own deformity have wisely thrust the action of see outward we go forward with the current but to turn back towards ourselves be a painful motion so be the sea move and trouble when the wave rush against one another observe say every one the motion of the heaven of public affair observe the quarrel of such a person take notice of such a one pulse of such anothers last will and testament in sum be always look high or low on one side before or behind you it be a paradoxical command anciently give u by that god of delphos look into yourself discover yourself keep close to yourself call back your mind and will that elsewhere consume themselves into yourself you run out you spill yourself carry a more steady hand men betray you men spill you men steal you from yourself dost thou not see that this world we live in keep all it sight confine within and it eye open to contemplate itself ti always vanity for thee both within and without but ti less vanity when less extend excepting thee o man say that god everything study itself first and have bound to it labour and desire accord to it need there be nothing so empty and necessitous a thou who embracest the universe thou art the investigator without knowledge the magistrate without jurisdiction and after all the fool of the farce few thing in comparison of what commonly affect other men move or to say good posse me for ti but reason they should concern a man provide they do not possess him i be very solicitous both by study and argument to enlarge this privilege of insensibility which be in me naturally raise to a pretty degree so that consequently i espouse and be very much move with very few thing i have a clear sight enough but i fix it upon very few object i have a sense delicate and tender enough but an apprehension and application hard and negligent i be very unwilling to engage myself as much a in me lie i employ myself wholly on myself and even in that subject should rather choose to curb and restrain my affection from plunge itself over head and ears into it it be a subject that i possess at the mercy of other and over which fortune have more right than i so that even a to health which i so much value ti all the more necessary for me not so passionately to covet and heed it than to find disease so insupportable a man ought to moderate himself betwixt the hatred of pain and the love of pleasure and plato set down a middle path of life betwixt the two but against such affection a wholly carry me away from myself and fix me elsewhere against those i say i oppose myself with my utmost power ti my opinion that a man should lend himself to other and only give himself to himself were my will easy to lend itself out and to be sway i should not stick there i be too tender both by nature and use hot and obstinate dispute wherein my adversary would at last have the good the issue that would render my heat and obstinacy disgraceful would peradventure vex me to the last degree should i set myself to it at the rate that other do my soul would never have the force to bear the emotion and alarm of those who grasp at so much it would immediately be disorder by this inward agitation if sometimes i have be put upon the management of other men affair i have promise to take them in hand but not into my lung and liver to take them upon me not to incorporate them to take pain yes to be impassioned about it by no mean i have a care of them but i will not sit upon them i have enough to do to order and govern the domestic throng of those that i have in my own vein and bowel without introduce a crowd of other men affair and be sufficiently concern about my own proper and natural business without meddle with the concern of other such a know how much they owe to themselves and how many office they be bind to of their own find that nature have cut them out work enough of their own to keep them from be idle thou hast business enough at home look to that men let themselves out to hire their faculty be not for themselves but for those to whom they have enslave themselves tis their tenant occupy them not themselves this common humour please not me we must be thrifty of the liberty of our soul and never let it out but upon just occasion which be very few if we judge aright do but observe such a have accustom themselves to be at every one call they do it indifferently upon all as well little a great occasion in that which nothing concern them as much a in what import them most they thrust themselves in indifferently wherever there be work to do and obligation and be without life when not in tumultuous bustle it be not so much that they will go a it be that they can not stand still like a roll stone that can not stop till it can go no further occupation with a certain sort of men be a mark of understanding and dignity their soul seek repose in agitation a child do by be rock in a cradle they may pronounce themselves a serviceable to their friend a they be troublesome to themselves no one distribute hi money to other but every one distribute hi time and hi life there be nothing of which we be so prodigal a of these two thing of which to be thrifty would be both commendable and useful i be of a quite contrary humour i look to myself and commonly covet with no great ardour what i do desire and desire little and i employ and busy myself at the same rate rarely and temperately whatever they take in hand they do it with their utmost will and vehemence there be so many dangerous step that for the more safety we must a little lightly and superficially glide over the world and not rush through it pleasure itself be painful in profundity the parliament of bordeaux choose me mayor of their city at a time when i be at a distance from france and still more remote from any such thought i entreat to be excuse but i be tell by my friend that i have commit an error in so do and the great because the king have moreover interpose hi command in that affair ti an office that ought to be look upon so much more honourable a it have no other salary nor advantage than the bare honour of it execution it continue two year but may be extend by a second election which very rarely happen it be to me and have never be so but twice before some year ago to monsieur de lansac and lately to monsieur de biron marshal of france in whose place i succeed and i leave mine to monsieur de matignon marshal of france also proud of so noble a fraternity fortune would have a hand in my promotion by this particular circumstance which she put in of her own not altogether vain for alexander disdain the ambassador of corinth who come to offer him a burgessship of their city but when they proceed to lay before him that bacchus and hercules be also in the register he graciously thank them at my arrival i faithfully and conscientiously represent myself to them for such a i find myself to be a man without memory without vigilance without experience and without vigour but withal without hatred without ambition without avarice and without violence that they might be inform of my quality and know what they be to expect from my service and whereas the knowledge they have have of my late father and the honour they have for hi memory have alone incite them to confer this favour upon me i plainly tell them that i should be very sorry anything should make so great an impression upon me a their affair and the concern of their city have make upon him whilst he hold the government to which they have prefer me i remember when a boy to have see him in hi old age cruelly torment with these public affair neglect the soft repose of hi own house to which the declension of hi age have reduce him for several year before the management of hi own affair and hi health and certainly despise hi own life which be in great danger of be lose by be engage in long and painful journey on their behalf such be he and this humour of hi proceed from a marvellous good nature never be there a more charitable and popular soul yet this proceeding which i commend in other i do not love to follow myself and be not without excuse he have learn that a man must forget himself for hi neighbour and that the particular be of no manner of consideration in comparison with the general most of the rule and precept of the world run this way to drive u out of ourselves into the street for the benefit of public society they think to do a great feat to divert and remove u from ourselves assume we be but too much fix there and by a too natural inclination and have say all they could to that purpose for ti no new thing for the sage to preach thing a they serve not a they be truth have it obstruction inconvenience and incompatibility with u we must often deceive that we may not deceive ourselves and shut our eye and our understanding to redress and amend them when they order u to love three four or fifty degree of thing above ourselves they do like archer who to hit the white take their aim a great deal high than the butt to make a crooked stick straight we bend it the contrary way i believe that in the temple of pallas a we see in all other religion there be apparent mystery to be expose to the people and other more secret and high that be only to be show to such a be profess ti likely that in these the true point of friendship that every one owes to himself be to be find not a false friendship that make u embrace glory knowledge rich and the like with a principal and immoderate affection a member of our be nor an indiscreet and effeminate friendship wherein it happen a with ivy that it decay and ruin the wall it embrace but a sound and regular friendship equally useful and pleasant he who know the duty of this friendship and practise them be truly of the cabinet of the mus and have attain to the height of human wisdom and of our happiness such an one exactly know what he owe to himself will on hi part find that he ought to apply to himself the use of the world and of other men and to do this to contribute to public society the duty and office appertain to him he who do not in some sort live for other do not live much for himself the principal charge we have be to every one hi own conduct and ti for this only that we here be a he who should forget to live a virtuous and holy life and should think he acquit himself of hi duty in instruct and train other up to it would be a fool even so he who abandon hi own particular healthful and pleasant living to serve other therewith take in my opinion a wrong and unnatural course i would not that men should refuse in the employment they take upon them their attention pain eloquence sweat and blood if need be but tis only borrow and accidentally hi mind be always in repose and in health not without action but without vexation without passion to be simply act cost him so little that he act even sleep but it must be set on go with discretion for the body receive the office impose upon it just accord to what they be the mind often extend and make them heavy at it own expense give them what measure it please men perform like thing with several sort of endeavour and different contention of will the one do well enough without the other for how many people hazard themselves every day in war without any concern which way it go and thrust themselves into the danger of battle the loss of which will not break their next night sleep and such a man may be at home out of the danger which he durst not have look upon who be more passionately concern for the issue of this war and whose soul be more anxious about event than the soldier who therein stake hi blood and hi life i could have engage myself in public employment without quit my own matter a nails breadth and have give myself to other without abandon myself this sharpness and violence of desire more hind than they advance the execution of what we undertake fill u with impatience against slow or contrary event and with heat and suspicion against those with whom we have to do we never carry on that thing well by which we be prepossess and lead he who therein employ only hi judgment and address proceeds more cheerfully he counterfeit he give way he defer quite at hi ease accord to the necessity of occasion he fail in hi attempt without trouble and affliction ready and entire for a new enterprise he always march with the bridle in hi hand in him who be intoxicate with this violent and tyrannical intention we discover of necessity much imprudence and injustice the impetuosity of hi desire carry him away these be rash motion and if fortune do not very much assist of very little fruit philosophy direct that in the revenge of injury receive we should strip ourselves of choler not that the chastisement should be less but on the contrary that the revenge may be the good and more heavily lay on which it conceive will be by this impetuosity hinder for anger not only disturb but of itself also weary the arm of those who chastise this fire benumbs and waste their force a in precipitation festinatio tarda est haste trip up it own heel fetter and stop itself for example accord to what i commonly see avarice have no great impediment than itself the more bent and vigorous it be the less it rake together and commonly sooner grow rich when disguise in a visor of liberality a very excellent gentleman and a friend of mine run a risk of impair hi faculty by a too passionate attention and affection to the affair of a certain prince hi master which master have thus portray himself to me that he foresee the weight of accident as well a another but that in those for which there be no remedy he presently resolve upon suffer in other have take all the necessary precaution which by the vivacity of hi understanding he can presently do he quietly await what may follow and in truth i have accordingly see him maintain a great indifferency and liberty of action and serenity of countenance in very great and difficult affair i find him much great and of great capacity in adverse than in prosperous fortune hi defeat be to him more glorious than hi victory and hi mourning than hi triumph consider that even in vain and frivolous action a at chess tennis and the like this eager and ardent engage with an impetuous desire immediately throw the mind and member into indiscretion and disorder a man astound and hinders himself he who carry himself more moderately both towards gain and loss have always hi wit about him the less peevish and passionate he be at play he play much more advantageously and surely a to the rest we hinder the mind grasp and hold in give it so many thing to seize upon some thing we should only offer to it tie it to other and with other incorporate it it can feel and discern all thing but ought to fee upon nothing but itself and should be instruct in what properly concern itself and that be properly of it own have and substance the law of nature teach u what justly we need after the sage have tell u that no one be indigent accord to nature and that every one be so accord to opinion they very subtly distinguish betwixt the desire that proceed from her and those that proceed from the disorder of our own fancy those of which we can see the end be hers those that fly before u and of which we can see no end be our own the poverty of good be easily cure the poverty of the soul be irreparable socrates see a great quantity of rich jewel and furniture carry in pomp through hi city how many thing say he i do not desire metrodorus live on twelve ounce a day epicurus upon less metrocles slept in winter abroad amongst sheep in summer in the cloister of church cleanthes live by the labour of hi own hand and boast that cleanthes if he would could yet maintain another cleanthes if that which nature exactly and originally require of u for the conservation of our be be too little a in truth what it be and how good cheap life may be maintain can not be good express than by this consideration that it be so little that by it littleness it escape the gripe and shock of fortune let u allow ourselves a little more let u call every one of our habit and condition nature let u rate and treat ourselves by this measure let u stretch our appurtenance and account so far for so far i fancy we have some excuse custom be a second nature and no less powerful what be want to my custom i reckon be want to me and i should be almost as well content that they take away my life a cut me short in the way wherein i have so long live i be no longer in condition for any great change nor to put myself into a new and unwonted course not even to augmentation ti past the time for me to become other than what i be and a i should complain of any great good hap that should now befall me that it come not in time to be enjoy so should i complain of any inward acquisition it be almost good never than so late to become an honest man and well fit to live when one have no long to live i who be about to make my exit out of the world would easily resign to any newcomer who should desire it all the prudence i be now acquire in the world commerce after meat mustard i have no need of good of which i can make no use of what use be knowledge to him who have lose hi head ti an injury and unkindness in fortune to tender u present that will only inspire u with a just despite that we have them not in their due season guide me no more i can no longer go of so many part a make up a sufficiency patience be the most sufficient give the capacity of an excellent treble to the chorister who have rotten lung and eloquence to a hermit exile into the desert of arabia there need no art to help a fall the end find itself of itself at the conclusion of every affair my world be at an end my form expire i be totally of the past and be bind to authorise it and to conform my outgo to it i will here declare by way of example that the pope late ten day diminution have take me so aback that i can not well reconcile myself to it i belong to the year wherein we keep another kind of account so ancient and so long a custom challenge my adherence to it so that i be constrain to be somewhat heretical on that point incapable of any though corrective innovation my imagination in spite of my teeth always push me ten day forward or backward and be ever murmur in my ear this rule concern those who be to begin to be if health itself sweet a it be return to me by fit tis rather to give me cause of regret than possession of it i have no place leave to keep it in time leave me without which nothing can be possess oh what little account should i make of those great elective dignity that i see in such esteem in the world that be never confer but upon men who be take leave of it wherein they do not so much regard how well the man will discharge hi trust a how short hi administration will be from the very entry they look at the exit in short i be about finish this man and not rebuild another by long use this form be in me turn into substance and fortune into nature i say therefore that every one of u feeble creature be excusable in think that to be hi own which be comprise under this measure but withal beyond these limit tis nothing but confusion ti the large extent we can grant to our own claim the more we amplify our need and our possession so much the more do we expose ourselves to the blow of fortune and adversities the career of our desire ought to be circumscribe and restrain to a short limit of the near and most contiguous commodity and their course ought moreover to be perform not in a right line that end elsewhere but in a circle of which the two point by a short wheel meet and terminate in ourselves action that be carry on without this reflection a near and essential reflection i mean such a those of ambitious and avaricious men and so many more a run pointblank and to whose career always carry them before themselves such action i say be erroneous and sickly most of our business be farce we must play our part properly but withal a a part of a borrow personage we must not make real essence of a mask and outward appearance nor of a strange person our own we can not distinguish the skin from the shirt ti enough to meal the face without meal the breast i see some who transform and transubstantiate themselves into as many new shape and new being a they undertake new employment and who strut and fume even to the heart and liver and carry their state along with them even to the closestool i can not make them distinguish the salutation make to themselves from those make to their commission their train or their mule they swell and puff up their soul and their natural way of speak accord to the height of their magisterial place the mayor of bordeaux and montaigne have ever be two by very manifest separation because one be an advocate or a financier he must not ignore the knavery there be in such calling an honest man be not accountable for the vice or absurdity of hi employment and ought not on that account refuse to take the call upon him tis the usage of hi country and there be money to be get by it a man must live by the world and make hi best of it such a it be but the judgment of an emperor ought to be above hi empire and see and consider it a a foreign accident and he ought to know how to enjoy himself apart from it and to communicate himself a james and peter to himself at all event i can not engage myself so deep and so entire when my will give me to anything ti not with so violent an obligation that my judgment be infect with it in the present broil of this kingdom my own interest have not make me blind to the laudable quality of our adversary nor to those that be reproach in those men of our party other adore all of their own side for my part i do not so much a excuse most thing in those of mine a good work have never the bad grace with me for be make against me the knot of the controversy except i have always keep myself in equanimity and pure indifference for which i be pleased with myself and the more because i see other commonly fail in the contrary direction such a extend their anger and hatred beyond the dispute in question a most men do show that they spring from some other occasion and private cause like one who be cure of an ulcer have yet a fever remaining by which it appear that the ulcer have another more concealed begin the reason be that they be not concern in the common cause because it be wound to the state and general interest but be only nettle by reason of their particular concern this be why they be so especially animated and to a degree so far beyond justice and public reason i would have the advantage on our side but if it be not i shall not run mad i be heartily for the right party but i do not want to be take notice of a an especial enemy to other and beyond the general quarrel i marvellously challenge this vicious form of opinion he be of the league because he admire the graciousness of monsieur de guise he be astonish at the king of navarres energy therefore he be a huguenot he find this to say of the manner of the king he be therefore seditious in hi heart and i do not grant to the magistrate himself that he do well in condemn a book because it have place a heretic amongst the best poet of the time shall we not dare to say of a thief that he have a handsome leg if a woman be a strumpet must it need follow that she have a foul smell did they in the wise age revoke the proud title of capitolinus they have before confer on marcus manlius a conservator of religion and the public liberty and stifle the memory of hi liberality hi feat of arm and military recompense grant to hi valour because he afterwards aspire to the sovereignty to the prejudice of the law of hi country if we take a hatred against an advocate he will not be allow the next day to be eloquent i have elsewhere speak of the zeal that push on worthy men to the like fault for my part i can say such an one do this thing ill and another thing virtuously and well so in the prognostication or sinister event of affair they would have every one in hi party blind or a blockhead and that our persuasion and judgment should subserve not truth but to the project of our desire i should rather incline towards the other extreme so much i fear be suborn by my desire to which may be add that i be a little tenderly distrustful of thing that i wish i have in my time see wonder in the indiscreet and prodigious facility of people in suffer their hope and belief to be lead and govern which way best pleased and serve their leader despite a hundred mistake one upon another despite mere dream and phantasm i no more wonder at those who have be blind and seduce by the foolery of apollonius and mahomet their sense and understanding be absolutely take away by their passion their discretion have no more any other choice than that which smile upon them and encourage their cause i have principally observe this in the beginning of our intestine distemper that other which have spring up since in imitating have surpass it by which i be satisfied that it be a quality inseparable from popular error after the first that roll opinion drive on one another like wave with the wind a man be not a member of the body if it be in hi power to forsake it and if he do not roll the common way but doubtless they wrong the just side when they go about to assist it with fraud i have ever be against that practice tis only fit to work upon weak head for the sound there be sure and more honest way to keep up their courage and to excuse adverse accident heaven never saw a great animosity than that betwixt caesar and pompey nor ever shall and yet i observe methinks in those brave soul a great moderation towards one another it be a jealousy of honour and command which do not transport them to a furious and indiscreet hatred and be without malignity and detraction in their hot exploit upon one another i discover some remains of respect and goodwill and be therefore of opinion that have it be possible each of them would rather have do hi business without the ruin of the other than with it take notice how much otherwise matter go with marius and sylla we must not precipitate ourselves so headlong after our affection and interest a when i be young i oppose myself to the progress of love which i perceive to advance too fast upon me and have a care l it should at last become so pleasing a to force captivate and wholly reduce me to it mercy so i do the same upon all other occasion where my will be run on with too warm an appetite i lean opposite to the side it incline to a i find it go to plunge and make itself drunk with it own wine i evade nourish it pleasure so far that i can not recover it without infinite loss soul that through their own stupidity only discern thing by half have this happiness that they smart less with hurtful thing tis a spiritual leprosy that have some show of health and such a health a philosophy do not altogether contemn but yet we have no reason to call it wisdom a we often do and after this manner some one anciently mock diogeries who in the depth of winter and quite naked go embrace an image of snow for a trial of hi endurance the other see him in this position art thou now very cold say he not at all replied diogenes why then pursue the other what difficult and exemplary thing dost thou think thou doest in embrace that snow to take a true measure of constancy one must necessarily know what the suffering be but soul that be to meet with adverse event and the injury of fortune in their depth and sharpness that be to weigh and taste them accord to their natural weight and bitterness let such show their skill in avoid the cause and divert the blow what do king cotys do he pay liberally for the rich and beautiful vessel that have be present to him but see it be exceedingly brittle he immediately break it betimes to prevent so easy a matter of displeasure against hi servant in like manner i have willingly avoid all confusion in my affair and never covet to have my estate contiguous to those of my relation and such with whom i covet a strict friendship for thence matter of unkindness and fall out often proceed i formerly love hazardous game of card and dice but have long since leave them off only for this reason that with whatever good air i carry my loss i could not help feel vexed within a man of honour who ought to be touchily sensible of the lie or of an insult and who be not to take a scurvy excuse for satisfaction should avoid occasion of dispute i shun melancholy crab men a i would the plague and in matter i can not talk of without emotion and concern i never meddle if not compel by my duty the sure way therefore be to prepare one self beforehand for occasion i know very well that some wise men have take another way and have not fear to grapple and engage to the utmost upon several subject these be confident of their own strength under which they protect themselves in all ill successes make their patience wrestle and contend with disaster let u not attempt these example we shall never come up to them they set themselves resolutely and without agitation to behold the ruin of their country which possess and command all their will this be too much and too hard a task for our commoner soul cato give up the noble life that ever be upon this account we meaner spirit must fly from the storm as far a we can we must provide for sentiment and not for patience and evade the blow we can not meet zeno see chremonides a young man whom he love draw near to sit down by him suddenly start up and cleanthes demanding of him the reason why he do so i hear say he that physicians especially order repose and forbid emotion in all tumour socrates do not say do not surrender to the charm of beauty stand your ground and do your utmost to oppose it fly it say he shun the fight and encounter of it a of a powerful poison that dart and wound at a distance and hi good disciple feigning or recite but in my opinion rather recite than feign the rare perfection of the great cyrus make him distrustful of hi own strength to resist the charm of the divine beauty of that illustrous panthea hi captive and commit the visiting and keep her to another who could not have so much liberty a himself and the holy ghost in like manner we do not pray that our reason may not be combat and overcome by concupiscence but that it should not be so much a try by it that we should not be bring into a state wherein we be so much a to suffer the approach solicitation and temptation of sin and we beg of almighty god to keep our conscience quiet fully and perfectly deliver from all commerce of evil such a say that they have reason for their revenging passion or any other sort of troublesome agitation of mind often say true a thing now be but not a they be they speak to u when the cause of their error be by themselves nourished and advanced but look backward recall these cause to their beginning and there you will put them to a nonplus will they have their fault less for be of long continuance and that of an unjust begin the sequel can be just whoever shall desire the good of hi country a i do without fret or pin himself will be trouble but will not swoon to see it threaten either it own ruin or a no less ruinous continuance poor vessel that the wave the wind and the pilot toss and steer to so contrary design he who do not gape after the favour of prince a after a thing he can not live without do not much concern himself at the coldness of their reception and countenance nor at the inconstancy of their will he who do not brood over hi child or hi honour with a slavish propension cease not to live commodiously enough after their loss he who do good principally for hi own satisfaction will not be much troubled to see men judge of hi action contrary to hi merit a quarter of an ounce of patience will provide sufficiently against such inconvenience i find ease in this receipt redeem myself in the beginning a good cheap a i can and find that by this mean i have escape much trouble and many difficulty with very little ado i stop the first sally of my emotion and leave the subject that begin to be troublesome before it transport me he who stop not the start will never be able to stop the course he who can not keep them out will never get them out when they be once get in and he who can not arrive at the beginning will never arrive at the end of all nor will he bear the fall who can not sustain the shock i be betimes sensible of the little breeze that begin to sing and whistle within forerunner of the storm how often have i do myself a manifest injustice to avoid the hazard of have yet a bad do me by the judge after an age of vexation dirty and vile practice more enemy to my nature than fire or the rack were we wise we ought to rejoice and boast a i one day hear a young gentleman of a good family very innocently do that hi mother have lose her cause a if it have be a cough a fever or something very troublesome to keep even the favour that fortune might have give me through relationship or acquaintance with those who have sovereign authority in those affair i have very conscientiously and very carefully avoid employ them to the prejudice of other and of advance my pretension above their true right in fine i have so much prevail by my endeavour and happily i may say it that i be to this day a virgin from all suit in law though i have have very fair offer make me and with very just title would i have hearken to them and a virgin from quarrel too i have almost pass over a long life without any offence of moment either active or passive or without ever hear a bad word than my own name a rare favour of heaven our great agitation have ridiculous spring and cause what ruin do our last duke of burgundy run into about a cartload of sheepskin and be not the graving of a seal the first and principal cause of the great commotion that this machine of the world ever underwent for pompey and caesar be but the offset and continuation of the two other and i have in my time see the wise head in this kingdom assemble with great ceremony and at the public expense about treaty and agreement of which the true decision in the meantime absolutely depend upon the lady cabinet council and the inclination of some bit of a woman the poet very well understand this when they put all greece and asia to fire and sword about an apple look why that man hazard hi life and honour upon the fortune of hi rapier and dagger let him acquaint you with the occasion of the quarrel he can not do it without blush the occasion be so idle and frivolous a little thing will engage you in it but be once embark all the cord draw great provision be then require more hard and more important how much easy be it not to enter in than it be to get out now we should proceed contrary to the reed which at it first springing produce a long and straight shoot but afterwards a if tire and out of breath it run into thick and frequent joint and knot a so many pause which demonstrate that it have no more it first vigour and firmness twere well to begin gently and coldly and to keep one breath and vigorous effort for the height and stress of the business we guide affair in their beginning and have them in our own power but afterwards when they be once at work ti they that guide and govern u and we be to follow them yet do i not mean to say that this counsel have discharge me of all difficulty and that i have not often have enough to do to curb and restrain my passion they be not always to be govern accord to the measure of occasion and often have their entry very sharp and violent but still good fruit and profit may thence be reap except for those who in welldoing be not satisfy with any benefit if reputation be want for in truth such an effect be not value but by every one to himself you be well content but not more esteemed see you reform yourself before you get into the whirl of the dance or that the provocative matter be in sight yet not in this only but in all other duty of life also the way of those who aim at honour be very different from that they proceed by who propose to themselves order and reason i find some who rashly and furiously rush into the list and cool in the course a plutarch say that those who through false shame be soft and facile to grant whatever be desire of them be afterwards a facile to break their word and to recant so he who enter lightly into a quarrel be apt to go as lightly out of it the same difficulty that keep me from enter into it would when once hot and engage in quarrel incite me to maintain it with great obstinacy and resolution ti the tyranny of custom when a man be once engage he must go through with it or die undertake coolly say bias but pursue with ardour for want of prudence men fall into want of courage which be still more intolerable most accommodation of the quarrel of these day of ours be shameful and false we only seek to save appearance and in the meantime betray and disavow our true intention we salve over the fact we know very well how we say the thing and in what sense we speak it and the company know it and our friend whom we have wish to make sensible of our advantage understand it well enough too ti at the expense of our frankness and of the honour of our courage that we disown our thought and seek refuge in falsity to make matter up we give ourselves the lie to excuse the lie we have give to another you be not to consider if your word or action may admit of another interpretation ti your own true and sincere interpretation your real meaning in what you say or do that you be thenceforward to maintain whatever it cost you men speak to your virtue and conscience which be not thing to be put under a mask let u leave these pitiful way and expedient to the juggler of the law the excuse and reparation that i see every day make and give to repair indiscretion seem to me more scandalous than the indiscretion itself it be good to affront your adversary a second time than to offend yourself by give him so unmanly a satisfaction you have brave him in your heat and anger and you would flatter and appease him in your cooler and good sense and by that mean lay yourself low and at hi foot whom before you pretend to overtop i do not find anything a gentleman can say so vicious in him a unsay what he have say be infamous when to unsay it be authoritatively extract from him forasmuch a obstinacy be more excusable in a man of honour than pusillanimity passion be a easy for me to evade a they be hard for me to moderate he who can not attain the noble stoical impassibility let him secure himself in the bosom of this popular stolidity of mine what they perform by virtue i inure myself to do by temperament the middle region harbour storm and tempests the two extreme of philosopher and peasant concur in tranquillity and happiness the birth of all thing be weak and tender and therefore we should have our eye intent on beginning for a when in it infancy the danger be not perceive so when it be grow up the remedy be as little to be find i have every day encounter a million of cross harder to digest in the progress of ambition than it have be hard for me to curb the natural propension that incline me to it all public action be subject to uncertain and various interpretation for too many head judge of them some say of this civic employment of mine and i be willing to say a word or two about it not that it be worth so much but to give an account of my manner in such thing that i have behave myself in it a a man who be too supine and of a languid temperament and they have some colour for what they say i endeavour to keep my mind and my thought in repose and if they sometimes lash out upon some rude and sensible impression ti in truth without my advice yet from this natural heaviness of mine men ought not to conclude a total inability in me for want of care and want of sense be two very different thing and much less any unkindness or ingratitude towards that corporation who employ the utmost mean they have in their power to oblige me both before they know me and after and they do much more for me in choose me anew than in confer that honour upon me at first i wish them all imaginable good and assuredly have occasion be there be nothing i would have spar for their service i do for them a i would have do for myself ti a good warlike and generous people but capable of obedience and discipline and of whom the best use may be make if well guide they say also that my administration pass over without leave any mark or trace good they moreover accuse my cessation in a time when everybody almost be convict of do too much i be impatient to be do where my will spur me on but this itself be an enemy to perseverance let him who will make use of me accord to my own way employ me in affair where vigour and liberty be require where a direct short and moreover a hazardous conduct be necessary i may do something but if it must be long subtle laborious artificial and intricate he have well call in somebody els all important office be not necessarily difficult i come prepare to do somewhat rougher work have there be great occasion for it be in my power to do something more than i do or than i love to do i do not to my knowledge omit anything that my duty really require i easily forget those office that ambition mix with duty and palliate with it title these be they that for the most part fill the eye and ear and give men the most satisfaction not the thing but the appearance content them if they hear no noise they think men sleep my humour be no friend to tumult i could appease a commotion without commotion and chastise a disorder without be myself disorderly if i stand in need of anger and inflammation i borrow it and put it on my manner be languid rather faint than sharp i do not condemn a magistrate who sleep provide the people under hi charge sleep as well a he the law in that case sleep too for my part i commend a gliding staid and silent life my fortune will have it so i be descend from a family that have live without lustre or tumult and time out of mind particularly ambitious of a character for probity our people nowadays be so breed up to bustle and ostentation that good nature moderation equability constancy and such like quiet and obscure quality be no more thought on or regard rough body make themselves felt the smooth be imperceptibly handled sickness be felt health little or not at all no more than the oil that foment u in comparison of the pain for which we be foment ti act for one particular reputation and profit not for the public good to refer that to be do in the public square which one may do in the council chamber and to noon day what might have be do the night before and to be jealous to do that himself which hi colleague can do as well a he so be some surgeon of greece wont to perform their operation upon scaffold in the sight of the people to draw more practice and profit they think that good rule can not be understand but by the sound of trumpet ambition be not a vice of little people nor of such modest mean a ours one say to alexander your father will leave you a great dominion easy and pacific this youth be emulous of hi father victory and of the justice of hi government he would not have enjoy the empire of the world in ease and peace alcibiades in plato have rather die young beautiful rich noble and learn and all this in full excellence than to stop short of such condition this disease be peradventure excusable in so strong and so full a soul when wretched and dwarfish little souls cajole and deceive themselves and think to spread their fame for have give right judgment in an affair or maintain the discipline of the guard of a gate of their city the more they think to exalt their head the more they show their tail this little welldoing have neither body nor life it vanish in the first mouth and go no further than from one street to another talk of it by all mean to your son or your servant like that old fellow who have no other auditor of hi praise nor approver of hi valour boast to hi chambermaid cry o perrete what a brave clever man hast thou for thy master at the bad talk of it to yourself like a councillor of my acquaintance who have disgorge a whole cart of law jargon with great heat and a great folly come out of the council chamber to make water be hear very complacently to mutter betwixt hi teeth he who get it of nobody els let him pay himself out of hi own purse fame be not prostitute at so cheap a rate rare and exemplary action to which it be due would not endure the company of this prodigious crowd of petty daily performance marble may exalt your title as much a you please for have repair a rod of wall or cleanse a public sewer but not men of sense renown do not follow all good deed if novelty and difficulty be not conjoin nay so much a mere esteem accord to the stoic be not due to every action that proceed from virtue nor will they allow him bare thanks who out of temperance abstains from an old bleareyed crone those who have know the admirable quality of scipio africanus deny him the glory that panaetius attribute to him of be abstinent from gift a a glory not so much hi a that of hi age we have pleasure suitable to our lot let u not usurp those of grandeur our own be more natural and by so much more solid and sure a they be low if not for that of conscience yet at least for ambition sake let u reject ambition let u disdain that thirst of honour and renown so low and mendicant that it make u beg it of all sort of people by abject mean and at what cheap rate soever ti dishonour to be so honoured let u learn to be no more greedy than we be capable of glory to be puff up with every action that be innocent or of use be only for those with whom such thing be extraordinary and rare they will value it a it cost them the more a good effect make a noise the more do i abate of it goodness a i suspect that it be more performed for the noise than upon account of the goodness expose upon the stall ti half sell those action have much more grace and lustre that slip from the hand of him that do them negligently and without noise and that some honest man thereafter find out and raise from the shade to produce it to the light upon it own account say the most ostentatious man that ever live i have but to conserve and to continue which be silent and insensible effect innovation be of great lustre but ti interdict in this age when we be press upon and have nothing to defend ourselves from but novelty to forbear do be often as generous a to do but tis less in the light and the little good i have in me be of this kind in fine occasion in this employment of mine have be confederate with my humour and i heartily thank them for it be there any who desire to be sick that he may see hi physician at work and would not the physician deserve to be whip who should wish the plague amongst u that he might put hi art in practice i have never be of that wicked humour and common enough to desire that trouble and disorder in this city should elevate and honour my government i have ever heartily contribute all i could to their tranquillity and ease he who will not thank me for the order the sweet and silent calm that have accompany my administration can not however deprive me of the share that belong to me by title of my good fortune and i be of such a composition that i would a willingly be lucky a wise and have rather owe my success purely to the favour of almighty god than to any operation of my own i have sufficiently publish to the world my unfitness for such public office but i have something in me yet bad than incapacity itself which be that i be not much displease at it and that i do not much go about to cure it consider the course of life that i have propose to myself neither have i satisfy myself in this employment but i have very near arrive at what i expect from my own performance and have much surpass what i promise them with whom i have to do for i be apt to promise something less than what i be able to do and than what i hope to make good i assure myself that i have leave no offence or hatred behind me to leave regret or desire for me amongst them i at least know very well that i never much aim at it ti now two or three year ago that they make the year ten day shorter in france how many change may we expect should follow this reformation it be really move heaven and earth at once yet nothing for all that stir from it place my neighbour still find their season of sowing and reap the opportunity of do their business the hurtful and propitious day dust at the same time where they have time out of mind assign them there be no more error perceive in our old use than there be amendment find in the alteration so great an uncertainty there be throughout so gross obscure and obtuse be our perception ti say that this regulation might have be carry on with less inconvenience by subtract for some year accord to the example of augustus the bissextile which be in some sort a day of impediment and trouble till we have exactly satisfy this debt the which itself be not do by this correction and we yet remain some day in arrear and yet by this mean such order might be take for the future arrange that after the revolution of such or such a number of year the supernumerary day might be always throw out so that we could not henceforward err above fourandtwenty hour in our computation we have no other account of time but year the world have for many age make use of that only and yet it be a measure that to this day we be not agree upon and one that we still doubt what form other nation have variously give to it and what be the true use of it what do this saying of some mean that the heaven in grow old bow themselves down nearer towards u and put u into an uncertainty even of hour and day and that which plutarch say of the month that astrology have not in hi time determine a to the motion of the moon what a fine condition be we in to keep record of thing past i be just now ruminate a i often do what a free and rove thing human reason be i ordinarily see that men in thing propound to them more willingly study to find out reason than to ascertain truth they slip over presupposition but be curious in examination of consequence they leave the thing and fly to the cause pleasant talkers the knowledge of cause only concern him who have the conduct of thing not u who be merely to undergo them and who have perfectly full and accomplished use of them accord to our need without penetrate into the original and essence wine be none the more pleasant to him who know it first faculty on the contrary both the body and the soul interrupt and weaken the right they have of the use of the world and of themselves by mix with it the opinion of learn effect concern u but the mean not at all to determine and to distribute appertain to superiority and command a it do to subjection to accept let me reprehend our custom they commonly begin thus how be such a thing do whereas they should say is such a thing do our reason be able to create a hundred other world and to find out the beginning and contexture it need neither matter nor foundation let it but run on it build as well in the air a on the earth and with inanity as well a with matter i find that almost throughout we should say there be no such thing and should myself often make use of this answer but i dare not for they cry that it be an evasion produce from ignorance and weakness of understanding and i be fain for the most part to juggle for company and prate of frivolous subject and tale that i believe not a word of besides that in truth ti a little rude and quarrelsome flatly to deny a stated fact and few people but will affirm especially in thing hard to be believe that they have see them or at least will name witness whose authority will stop our mouth from contradiction in this way we know the foundation and mean of thing that never be and the world scuffle about a thousand question of which both the pro and the con be false truth and lie be face alike their port taste and proceeding be the same and we look upon them with the same eye i find that we be not only remiss in defend ourselves from deceit but that we seek and offer ourselves to be gull we love to entangle ourselves in vanity a a thing conformable to our be i have see the birth of many miracle in my time which although they be abortive yet have we not fail to foresee what they would have come to have they live their full age ti but find the end of the clew and a man may wind off as much a he will and there be a great distance betwixt nothing and the least thing in the world than there be betwixt this and the great now the first that be imbue with this beginning of novelty when they set out with their tale find by the opposition they meet with where the difficulty of persuasion lie and so caulk up that place with some false piece besides that we naturally make a conscience of restore what have be lent u without some usury and accession of our own the particular error first make the public error and afterwards in turn the public error make the particular one and thus all this vast fabric go forming and pile itself up from hand to hand so that the remote witness know more about it than those who be nearest and the last informed be well persuade than the first ti a natural progress for whoever believe anything think it a work of charity to persuade another into the same opinion which the good to do he will make no difficulty of add a much of hi own invention a he conceive necessary to hi tale to encounter the resistance or want of conception he meet with in other i myself who make a great conscience of lie and be not very solicitous of give credit and authority to what i say yet find that in the argument i have in hand be heat with the opposition of another or by the proper warmth of my own narration i swell and puff up my subject by voice motion vigour and force of word and moreover by extension and amplification not without some prejudice to the naked truth but i do it conditionally withal that to the first who bring me to myself and who ask me the plain and bare truth i presently surrender my passion and deliver the matter to him without exaggeration without emphasis or any painting of my own a quick and earnest way of speaking a mine be be apt to run into hyperbole there be nothing to which men commonly be more inclined than to make way for their own opinion where the ordinary mean fail u we add command force fire and sword ti a misfortune to be at such a pas that the best test of truth be the multitude of believer in a crowd where the number of fool so much exceed the wise ti hard to resolve a man judgment against the common opinion the first persuasion take from the very subject itself possess the simple and from them diffuse itself to the wise under the authority of the number and antiquity of the witness for my part what i should not believe from one i should not believe from a hundred and one and i do not judge opinion by year ti not long since one of our prince in whom the gout have spoil an excellent nature and sprightly disposition suffer himself to be so far persuade with the report make to him of the marvellous operation of a certain priest who by word and gesture cure all sort of disease a to go a long journey to seek him out and by the force of hi mere imagination for some hour so persuaded and lay hi legs asleep a to obtain that service from them they have long time forget had fortune heap up five or six suchlike incident it have be enough to have bring this miracle into nature there be afterwards discover so much simplicity and so little art in the author of these performance that he be think too contemptible to be punish a would be think of most such thing be they well examine so do our sight often represent to u strange image at a distance that vanish on approach near ti wonderful from how many idle beginning and frivolous cause such famous impression commonly proceed this it be that obstruct information for whilst we seek out cause and solid and weighty end worthy of so great a name we lose the true one they escape our sight by their littleness and in truth a very prudent diligent and subtle inquisition be require in such search indifferent and not prepossess to this very hour all these miracle and strange event have conceal themselves from me i have never see great monster or miracle in the world than myself one grow familiar with all strange thing by time and custom but the more i frequent and the good i know myself the more do my own deformity astonish me the less i understand myself the principal right of advance and produce such accident be reserve to fortune pass the day before yesterday through a village two league from my house i find the place yet warm with a miracle that have lately fail of success there where with first the neighbourhood have be several month amuse then the neighbouring province begin to take it up and to run thither in great company of all sort of people a young fellow of the place have one night in sport counterfeit the voice of a spirit in hi own house without any other design at present but only for sport but this have succeed with him good than he expect to extend hi farce with more actor he associate with him a stupid silly country girl and at last there be three of them of the same age and understand who from domestic proceed to public preaching hide themselves under the altar of the church never speak but by night and forbid any light to be bring from word which tend to the conversion of the world and threat of the day of judgment for these be subject under the authority and reverence of which imposture most securely lurk they proceed to vision and gesticulation so simple and ridiculous that nothing could hardly be so gross in the sport of little child yet have fortune never so little favour the design who know to what height this juggling might have at last arrived these poor devil be at present in prison and be like shortly to pay for the common folly and i know not whether some judge will not also make them smart for hi we see clearly into this which be discover but in many thing of the like nature that exceed our knowledge i be of opinion that we ought to suspend our judgment whether a to rejection or a to reception great abuse in the world be beget or to speak more boldly all the abuse of the world be beget by our be teach to be afraid of profess our ignorance and that we be bind to accept all thing we be not able to refute we speak of all thing by precept and decision the style at rome be that even that which a witness depose to have see with hi own eye and what a judge determine with hi most certain knowledge be couch in this form of speak it seem to me they make me hate thing that be likely when they would impose them upon me a infallible i love these word which mollify and moderate the temerity of our proposition peradventure in some sort some ti say i think and the like and have i be set to train up child i have put this way of answer into their mouth inquire and not resolve what do this mean i understand it not it may be be it true so that they should rather have retain the form of pupil at threescore year old than to go out doctor a they do at ten whoever will be cure of ignorance must confess it iris be the daughter of thaumas admiration be the foundation of all philosophy inquisition the progress ignorance the end but there be a sort of ignorance strong and generous that yield nothing in honour and courage to knowledge an ignorance which to conceive require no less knowledge than to conceive knowledge itself i read in my young year a trial that corras a councillor of toulouse print of a strange incident of two men who present themselves the one for the other i remember and i hardly remember anything els that he seem to have render the imposture of him whom he judge to be guilty so wonderful and so far exceed both our knowledge and hi own who be the judge that i think it a very bold sentence that condemn him to be hang let u have some form of decree that say the court understand nothing of the matter more freely and ingenuously than the areopagite do who find themselves perplexed with a cause they could not unravel order the party to appear again after a hundred year the witch of my neighbourhood run the hazard of their life upon the report of every new author who seek to give body to their dream to accommodate the example that holy writ give u of such thing most certain and irrefragable example and to tie them to our modern event see that we neither see the cause nor the mean will require another sortof wit than ours it peradventure only appertain to that sole allpotent testimony to tell u this be and that be and not that other god ought to be believe and certainly with very good reason but not one amongst u for all that who be astonish at hi own narration and he must of necessity be astonish if he be not out of hi wit whether he employ it about other men affair or against himself i be plain and heavy and stick to the solid and the probable avoid those ancient reproach i see very well that men get angry and that i be forbidden to doubt upon pain of execrable injury a new way of persuade thank god i be not to be cuff into belief let them be angry with those who accuse their opinion of falsity i only accuse it of difficulty and boldness and condemn the opposite affirmation equally if not so imperiously with them he who will establish this proposition by authority and huff discovers hi reason to be very weak for a verbal and scholastic altercation let them have as much appearance a their contradictors but in the real consequence they draw from it these have much the advantage to kill men a clear and strong light be require and our life be too real and essential to warrant these supernatural and fantastic accident a to drug and poison i throw them out of my count a be the bad sort of homicide yet even in this ti say that men be not always to rely upon the personal confession of these people for they have sometimes be know to accuse themselves of the murder of person who have afterwards be find living and well in these other extravagant accusation i should be apt to say that it be sufficient a man what recommendation soever he may have be believe a to human thing but of what be beyond hi conception and of supernatural effect he ought then only to be believe when authorise by a supernatural approbation the privilege it have please almighty god to give to some of our witness ought not to be lightly communicate and make cheap i have my ear batter with a thousand such tale a these three person saw him such a day in the east three the next day in the west at such an hour in such a place and in such habit assuredly i should not believe it myself how much more natural and likely do i find it that two men should lie than that one man in twelve hour time should fly with the wind from east to west how much more natural that our understanding should be carry from it place by the volubility of our disordered mind than that one of u should be carry by a strange spirit upon a broomstaff flesh and bone a we be up the shaft of a chimney let not u seek illusion from without and unknown we who be perpetually agitate with illusion domestic and our own methinks one be pardonable in disbelieve a miracle at least at all event where one can elude it verification a such by mean not miraculous and i be of st augustine opinion that ti well to lean towards doubt than assurance in thing hard to prove and dangerous to believe ti now some year ago that i travel through the territory of a sovereign prince who in my favour and to abate my incredulity do me the honour to let me see in hi own presence and in a private place ten or twelve prisoner of this kind and amongst other an old woman a real witch in foulness and deformity who long have be famous in that profession i saw both proof and free confession and i know not what insensible mark upon the miserable creature i examine and talk with her and the rest a much and as long a i would and give the best and sound attention i could and i be not a man to suffer my judgment to be make captive by prepossession in the end and in all conscience i should rather have prescribe them hellebore than hemlock justice have it correction proper for such malady a to the opposition and argument that worthy men have make to me both there and often in other place i have meet with none that have convince me and that have not admit a more likely solution than their conclusion it be true indeed that the proof and reason that be found upon experience and fact i do not go about to untie neither have they any end i often cut them a alexander do the gordian knot after all ti set a man conjecture at a very high price upon them to cause a man to be roast alive we be tell by several example a praestantius of hi father that be more profoundly asleep than men usually be he fancy himself to be a mare and that he serve the soldier for a sumpter and what he fancy himself to be he really prove if sorcerer dream so materially if dream can sometimes so incorporate themselves with effect still i can not believe that therefore our will should be accountable to justice which i say a one who be neither judge nor privy councillor and who think myself by many degree unworthy so to be but a man of the common sort bear and avow to the obedience of the public reason both in it word and act he who should record my idle talk a be to the prejudice of the petty law opinion or custom of hi parish would do himself a great deal of wrong and me much more for in what i say i warrant no other certainty but that tis what i have then in my thought a tumultuous and waver think all i say be by way of discourse and nothing by way of advice i should not speak so boldly if it be my due to be believe and so i tell a great man who complain of the tartness and contentiousness of my exhortation perceive you to be ready and prepare on one part i propose to you the other with all the diligence and care i can to clear your judgment not to compel it god have your heart in hi hand and will furnish you with the mean of choice i be not so presumptuous even a to desire that my opinion should bias you in a thing of so great importance my fortune have not train them up to so potent and elevated conclusion truly i have not only a great many humour but also a great many opinion that i would endeavour to make my son dislike if i have one what if the truest be not always the most commodious to man be of so wild a composition whether it be to the purpose or not tis no great matter ti a common proverb in italy that he know not venus in her perfect sweetness who have never lie with a lame mistress fortune or some particular incident long ago put this say into the mouth of the people and the same be say of men as well a of woman for the queen of the amazon answer the scythian who court her to love lame men perform best in this feminine republic to evade the dominion of the male they lam them in their infancy arm leg and other member that give them advantage over them and only make use of them in that wherein we in these part of the world make use of them i should have be apt to think that the shuffle pace of the lame mistress add some new pleasure to the work and some extraordinary titillation to those who be at the sport but i have lately learn that ancient philosophy have itself determine it which say that the leg and thigh of lame woman not receive by reason of their imperfection their due aliment it fall out that the genital part above be full and good supply and much more vigorous or els that this defect hinder exercise they who be trouble with it less dissipate their strength and come more entire to the sport of venus which also be the reason why the greek decry the womenweavers a be more hot than other woman by reason of their sedentary trade which they carry on without any great exercise of the body what be it we may not reason of at this rate i might also say of these that the jaggling about whilst so sit at work rous and provokes their desire a the swinging and jolting of coach do that of our lady do not these example serve to make good what i say at first that our reason often anticipate the effect and have so infinite an extent of jurisdiction that they judge and exercise themselves even on inanity itself and nonexistency besides the flexibility of our invention to forge reason of all sort of dream our imagination be equally facile to receive impression of falsity by very frivolous appearance for by the sole authority of the ancient and common use of this proverb i have formerly make myself believe that i have have more pleasure in a woman by reason she be not straight and accordingly reckon that deformity amongst her grace torquato tasso in the comparison he make betwixt france and italy say that he have observe that our leg be generally small than those of the italian gentleman and attribute the cause of it to our be continually on horseback which be the very same cause from which suetonius draw a quite opposite conclusion for he say on the contrary that germanicus have make hi legs big by the continuation of the same exercise nothing be so supple and erratic a our understand it be the shoe of theramenes fit for all foot it be double and diverse and the matter be double and diverse too give me a drachm of silver say a cynic philosopher to antigonus that be not a present befit a king reply he give me then a talent say the other that be not a present befit a cynic this be the reason why clitomachus say of old that carneades have outdo the labour of hercules in have eradicate consent from men that be to say opinion and the courage of judge this so vigorous fancy of carneades sprang in my opinion anciently from the impudence of those who make profession of knowledge and their immeasurable selfconceit aesop be set to sale with two other slave the buyer ask the first of these what he could do he to enhance hi own value promise mountain and marvel say he could do this and that and i know not what the second say a much of himself or more when it come to aesop turn and that he be also ask what he could do nothing say he for these two have take up all before me they know everything so have it happen in the school of philosophy the pride of those who attribute the capacity of all thing to the human mind create in other out of despite and emulation this opinion that it be capable of nothing the one maintain the same extreme in ignorance that the other do in knowledge to make it undeniably manifest that man be immoderate throughout and can never stop but of necessity and the want of ability to proceed far almost all the opinion we have be take on authority and trust and ti not amiss we could not choose bad than by ourselves in so weak an age that image of socrates discourse which hi friend have transmit to u we approve upon no other account than a reverence to public sanction ti not accord to our own knowledge they be not after our way if anything of the kind should spring up now few men would value them we discern no grace that be not point and puff out and inflate by art such a glide on in their own purity and simplicity easily escape so gross a sight a ours they have a delicate and conceal beauty such a require a clear and purified sight to discover it secret light be not simplicity a we take it cousingerman to folly and a quality of reproach socrates make hi soul move a natural and common motion a peasant say this a woman say that he have never anybody in hi mouth but carter joiner cobbler and mason hi be induction and similitude draw from the most common and known action of men every one understand him we should never have recognise the nobility and splendour of hi admirable conception under so mean a form we who think all thing low and flat that be not elevate by learned doctrine and who discern no rich but in pomp and show this world of ours be only form for ostentation men be only puff up with wind and be bandy to and fro like tennisballs he propose to himself no vain and idle fancy hi design be to furnish u with precept and thing that more really and fitly serve to the use of life he be also always one and the same and raise himself not by start but by complexion to the high pitch of vigour or to say well mount not at all but rather bring down reduce and subject all asperity and difficulty to hi original and natural condition for in cato ti most manifest that ti a procedure extend far beyond the common way of men in the brave exploit of hi life and in hi death we find him always mount upon the great horse whereas the other ever creep upon the ground and with a gentle and ordinary pace treat of the most useful matter and bear himself both at hi death and in the rudest difficulty that could present themselves in the ordinary way of human life it have fall out well that the man most worthy to be know and to be present to the world for example should be he of whom we have the most certain knowledge he have be pry into by the most clearsighted men that ever be the testimony we have of him be admirable both in fidelity and ful ti a great thing that he be able so to order the pure imagination of a child that without alter or wrest them he thereby produce the most beautiful effect of our soul he present it neither elevate nor rich he only represent it sound but assuredly with a brisk and full health by these common and natural spring by these ordinary and popular fancy without be move or put out he set up not only the most regular but the most high and vigorous belief action and manner that ever be ti he who bring again from heaven where she lose her time human wisdom to restore her to man with whom her most just and great business lie see him plead before hi judge observe by what reason he rouse hi courage to the hazard of war with what argument he fortify hi patience against calumny tyranny death and the perverseness of hi wife you will find nothing in all this borrow from art and sciences the simplest may there discover their own mean and strength ti not possible more to retire or to creep more low he have do human nature a great kindness in show it how much it can do of itself we be all of u rich than we think we be but we be taught to borrow and to beg and bring up more to make use of what be anothers than of our own man can in nothing fix himself to hi actual necessity of pleasure wealth and power he grasp at more than he can hold hi greediness be incapable of moderation and i find that in curiosity of know he be the same he cut himself out more work than he can do and more than he need to do extend the utility of knowledge to the full of it matter and tacitus have reason to commend the mother of agricola for have restrain her son in hi too violent appetite for learn ti a good if duly consider which have in it a the other good of men have a great deal of vanity and weakness proper and natural to itself and that cost very dear it acquisition be far more hazardous than that of all other meat or drink for as to other thing what we have buy we carry home in some vessel and there have full leisure to examine our purchase how much we shall eat or drink of it and when but sciences we can at the very first stow into no other vessel than the soul we swallow them in buying and return from the market either already infect or amend there be some that only burden and overcharge the stomach instead of nourish and moreover some that under colour of cure poison u i have be please in place where i have be to see men in devotion vow ignorance as well a chastity poverty and penitence ti also a gelding of our unruly appetite to blunt this cupidity that spur u on to the study of book and to deprive the soul of this voluptuous complacency that tickle u with the opinion of knowledge and ti plenarily to accomplish the vow of poverty to add unto it that of the mind we need little doctrine to live at our ease and socrates teach u that this be in u and the way how to find it and the manner how to use it all our sufficiency which exceed the natural be wellnigh superfluous and vain ti much if it do not rather burden and cumber u than do u good ti a feverish excess of the mind a tempestuous and unquiet instrument do but recollect yourself and you will find in yourself natural argument against death true and the fit to serve you in time of necessity ti they that make a peasant and whole nation die with as much firmness a a philosopher should i have die less cheerfully before i have read cicero tusculan quastiones i believe not and when i find myself at the best i perceive that my tongue be enrich indeed but my courage little or nothing elevate by them that be just a nature frame it at first and defend itself against the conflict only after a natural and ordinary way book have not so much serve me for instruction a exercise what if knowledge try to arm u with new defence against natural inconvenience have more imprint in our fancy their weight and greatness than her reason and subtlety to secure u from them they be subtlety indeed with which she often alarm u to little purpose do but observe how many slight and frivolous and if nearly examine incorporeal argument the close and wise author scatter about one good one they be but verbal quirk and fallacy to amuse and gull u but forasmuch a it may be with some profit i will sift them no far many of that sort be here and there disperse up and down this book either borrow or by imitation therefore one ought to take a little heed not to call that force which be only a pretty knack of writing and that solid which be only sharp or that good which be only fine everything that please do not nourish to see the trouble that seneca give himself to fortify himself against death to see him so sweat and pant to harden and encourage himself and bustle so long upon this perch would have lessen hi reputation with me have he not very bravely hold himself at the last hi so ardent and frequent agitation discover that he be in himself impetuous and passionate he must be convince at hi own expense and he in some sort discovers that he be hard press by hi enemy plutarch way by how much it be more disdainful and farther stretch be in my opinion so much more manly and persuasive and i be apt to believe that hi soul have more assured and more regular motion the one more sharp prick and make u start and more touch the soul the other more constantly solid form establishes and support u and more touch the understanding that ravish the judgment this win it i have likewise see other writing yet more reverenced than these that in the representation of the conflict they maintain against the temptation of the flesh paint them so sharp so powerful and invincible that we ourselves who be of the common herd be as much to wonder at the strangeness and unknown force of their temptation a at the resist it to what end do we so arm ourselves with this harness of science let u look down upon the poor people that we see scattered upon the face of the earth prone and intent upon their business that neither know aristotle nor cato example nor precept from these nature every day extract effect of constancy and patience more pure and manly than those we so inquisitively study in the school how many do i ordinarily see who slight poverty how many who desire to die or who die without alarm or regret he who be now dig in my garden have this morning bury hi father or hi son the very name by which they call disease sweeten and mollify the sharpness of them the phthisic be with them no more than a cough dysentery but a looseness the pleurisy but a stitch and a they gently name them so they patiently endure them they be very great and grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary labour they never keep their bed but to die i be write this about the time when a great load of our intestine trouble for several month lay with all it weight upon me i have the enemy at my door on one side and the freebooter bad enemy on the other and underwent all sort of military injury at once a monstrous war other war be bent against stranger this against itself destroy itself with it own poison it be of so malignant and ruinous a nature that it ruin itself with the rest and with it own rage mangle and tear itself to piece we more often see it dissolve of itself than through scarcity of any necessary thing or by force of the enemy all discipline evade it it come to compose sedition and be itself full of it would chastise disobedience and itself be the example and employ for the defence of the law rebel against it own what a condition be we in our physic make u sick in the beginning of these popular malady one may distinguish the sound from the sick but when they come to continue a ours have do the whole body be then infect from head to foot no part be free from corruption for there be no air that men so greedily draw in that diffuse itself so soon and that penetrate so deep a that of licence our army only subsist and be keep together by the cement of foreigner for of frenchman there be now no constant and regular army to be make what a shame it be there be no longer any discipline but what we see in the mercenary soldier a to ourselves our conduct be at discretion and that not of the chief but every one at hi own the general have a harder game to play within than he have without he it be who have to follow to court the soldier to give way to them he alone have to obey all the rest if disolution and free licence it please me to observe how much pusillanimity and cowardice there be in ambition by how abject and servile way it must arrive at it end but it displease me to see good and generous nature and that be capable of justice every day corrupt in the management and command of this confusion long toleration begets habit habit consent and imitation we have illformed souls enough without spoil those that be generous and good so that if we hold on there will scarcely remain any with whom to intrust the health of this state of ours in case fortune chance to restore it what have become of the old precept that soldier ought more to fear their chief than the enemy and of that wonderful example that an orchard be enclose within the precinct of a camp of the roman army be see at their dislodgment the next day in the same condition not an apple though ripe and delicious be pull off but all leave to the possessor i could wish that our youth instead of the time they spend in less fruitful travel and less honourable employment would bestow one half of that time in be an eyewitness of naval exploit under some good captain of rhodes and the other half in observe the discipline of the turkish army for they have many difference and advantage over ours one of these be that our soldier become more licentious in expedition theirs more temperate and circumspect for the theft and insolencies commit upon the common people which be only punish with a cudgel in peace be capital in war for an egg take by a turkish soldier without pay for it fifty blow with a stick be the fixed rate for anything els of what sort or how trivial soever not necessary to nourishment they be presently impale or behead without mercy i be astonish in the history of selim the most cruel conqueror that ever be to see that when he subdue egypt the beautiful garden about damascus be all open and in a conquered land and hi army encamp upon the very place should be leave untouched by the hand of the soldier by reason they have not receive the signal of pillage but be there any disease in a government that it be worth while to physic with such a mortal drug no say favonius not even the tyrannical usurpation of a commonwealth plato likewise will not consent that a man should violate the peace of hi country in order to cure it and by no means approves of a reformation that disturbs and hazard all and that be to be purchase at the price of the citizen blood and ruin determine it to be the duty of a good patriot in such a case to let it alone and only to pray to god for hi extraordinary assistance and he seem to be angry with hi great friend dion for have proceed somewhat after another manner i be a platonist in this point before i know there have ever be such a man a plato in the world and if this person ought absolutely to be reject from our society he who by the sincerity of hi conscience merit from the divine favour to penetrate so far into the christian light through the universal darkness wherein the world be involve in hi time i do not think it become u to suffer ourselves to be instruct by a heathen how great an impiety it be not to expect from god any relief simply hi own and without our cooperation i often doubt whether amongst so many men a meddle in such affair there be not to be find some one of so weak understanding a to have be really persuaded that he go towards reformation by the bad of deformation and advanced towards salvation by the most express cause that we have of most assured damnation that by overthrow government the magistracy and the law in whose protection god have place him by dismember hi good mother and give her limb to be mangle by her old enemy fill fraternal heart with parricidal hatred call devil and fury to hi aid he can assist the most holy sweetness and justice of the divine law ambition avarice cruelty and revenge have not sufficient natural impetuosity of their own let u bait them with the glorious title of justice and devotion there can not a bad state of thing be imagine than where wickedness come to be legitimate and assume with the magistrate permission the cloak of virtue the extreme sort of injustice accord to plato be where that which be unjust should be repute for just the common people then suffer very much and not present damage only but future too the living be to suffer and so be they who be yet unborn they stript them and consequently myself even of hope take from them all they have lay up in store to live on for many year besides this shock i suffer other i undergo the inconvenience that moderation brings along with it in such a disease i be rob on all hand to the ghibelline i be a guelph and to the guelph a ghibelline one of my poet express this very well but i know not where it be the situation of my house and my friendliness with my neighbour present me with one face my life and my action with another they do not lay formal accusation to my charge for they have no foundation for so do i never hide my head from the law and whoever would have question me would have do himself a great prejudice than me they be only mute suspicion that be whisper about which never want appearance in so confused a mixture no more than envious or idle head i commonly myself lend a hand to injurious presumption that fortune scatter abroad against me by a way i have ever have of evade to justify excuse or explain myself conceive that it be to compromise my conscience to plead in it behalf and a if every one saw a clearly into me a i do myself instead of retire from an accusation i step up to meet it and rather give it some kind of colour by an ironical and scoffing confession if i do not sit totally mute a of a thing not worth my answer but such a look upon this kind of behaviour of mine a too haughty a confidence have as little kindness for me a they who interpret the weakness of an indefensible cause namely the great folk towards whom want of submission be the great fault harsh towards all justice that know and feel itself and be not submissive humble and suppliant i have often knock my head against this pillar so it be that at what then befall me an ambitious man would have hang himself and a covetous man would have do the same i have no manner of care of get but the loss that befall me by the injury of other whether by theft or violence go almost a near my heart a they would to that of the most avaricious man the offence trouble me without comparison more than the loss a thousand several sort of mischief fell upon me in the neck of one another i could more cheerfully have bear them all at once i be already consider to whom amongst my friend i might commit a necessitous and discredit old age and have turn my eye quite round i find myself bare to let one self fall plump down and from so great a height it ought to be in the arm of a solid vigorous and fortunate friendship these be very rare if there be any at last i saw that it be safest for me to trust to myself in my necessity and if it should so fall out that i should be but upon cold term in fortune favour i should so much the more pressingly recommend me to my own and attach myself and look to myself all the more closely men on all occasion throw themselves upon foreign assistance to spare their own which be alone certain and sufficient to him who know how therewith to arm himself every one run elsewhere and to the future forasmuch a no one be arrive at himself and i be satisfy that they be profitable inconvenience forasmuch a first ill scholar be to be admonish with the rod when reason will not do a a crooked piece of wood be by fire and strain reduce to straightness i have a great while preach to myself to stick close to my own concern and separate myself from the affair of other yet i be still turn my eye aside a bow a favourable word a kind look from a great person tempts me of which god know if there be scarcity in these day and what they signify i moreover without wrinkle my forehead hearken to the persuasion offer me to draw me into the marketplace and so gently refuse a if i be half willing to be overcome now for so indocile a spirit blow be require this vessel which thus chop and cleaves and be ready to fall one piece from another must have the hoop force down with good sound stroke of a mallet secondly that this accident serve me for exercise to prepare me for bad if i who both by the benefit of fortune and by the condition of my manner hop to be among the last should happen to be one of the first assail by this storm instruct myself betimes to constrain my life and fit it for a new state the true liberty be to be able to do what a man will with himself in an ordinary and quiet time a man prepare himself for moderate and common accident but in the confusion wherein we have be for these thirty year every frenchman whether personal or in general see himself every hour upon the point of the total ruin and overthrow of hi fortune by so much the more ought he to have hi courage supply with the strong and most vigorous provision let u thank fortune that have not make u live in an effeminate idle and languishing age some who could never have be so by other mean will be make famous by their misfortune a i seldom read in history the confusion of other state without regret that i be not present the good to consider them so do my curiosity make me in some sort please myself in see with my own eye this notable spectacle of our public death it form and symptom and since i can not hinder it i be content to have be destine to be present therein and thereby to instruct myself so do we eagerly covet to see though but in shadow and the fable of theatre the pomp of tragic representation of human fortune ti not without compassion at what we hear but we please ourselves in rouse our displeasure by the rarity of these pitiable event nothing tickle that do not pinch and good historian skip over a stagnant water and dead sea calm narration to return to sedition to war to which they know that we invite them i question whether i can decently confess with how small a sacrifice of it repose and tranquillity i have pass over above the one half of my life amid the ruin of my country i lend myself my patience somewhat too cheap in accident that do not privately assail me and do not so much regard what they take from me a what remain safe both within and without there be comfort in evade one while this another while that of the evil that be level at ourselves too at last but at present hurt other only about u a also that in matter of public interest the more universally my affection be disperse the weak it be to which may be add that it be half true and that the health from which we fell be so ill that itself relieve the regret we should have for it it be health but only in comparison with the sickness that have succeed it we be not fall from any great height the corruption and brigandage which be in dignity and office seem to me the least supportable we be less injuriously rifle in a wood than in a place of security it be an universal juncture of particular member each corrupt by emulation of the other and most of them with old ulcer that neither receive nor require any cure this convulsion therefore really more animated than press me by the assistance of my conscience which be not only at peace within itself but elevate and i do not find any reason to complain of myself also a god never send evils any more than good absolutely pure to men my health continue at that time more than usually good and a i can do nothing without it there be few thing that i can not do with it it afford me mean to rouse up all my faculty and to lay my hand before the wound that would els peradventure have go far and i experience in my patience that i have some stand against fortune and that it must be a great shock could throw me out of the saddle i do not say this to provoke her to give me a more vigorous charge i be her humble servant and submit to her pleasure let her be content in god name am i sensible of her assault yes i be but a those who be possess and oppress with sorrow sometimes suffer themselves nevertheless by interval to taste a little pleasure and be sometimes surprised with a smile so have i so much power over myself a to make my ordinary condition quiet and free from disturb thought yet i suffer myself withal by fit to be surprise with the sting of those unpleasing imagination that assault me whilst i be arm myself to drive them away or at least to wrestle with them but behold another aggravation of the evil which befall me in the tail of the rest both without door and within i be assail with a most violent plague violent in comparison of all other for a sound body be subject to more grievous malady forasmuch a they be not to be force but by such so my very healthful air where no contagion however near in the memory of man ever take foot come to be corrupt produced strange effect i have to suffer this pleasant condition that the sight of my house be frightful to me whatever i have there be without guard and leave to the mercy of any one who wish to take it i myself who be so hospitable be in very great distress for a retreat for my family a distract family frightful both to it friend and itself and fill every place with horror where it attempt to settle have to shift it abode so soon a any one finger begin but to ache all disease be then conclude to be the plague and people do not stay to examine whether they be so or no and the mischief ont be that accord to the rule of art in every danger that a man come near he must undergo a quarantine in fear of the evil your imagination all the while torment you at pleasure and turn even your health itself into a fever yet all this would have much less affected me have i not withal be compel to be sensible of the suffering of other and miserably to serve six month together for a guide to this caravan for i carry my own antidote within myself which be resolution and patience apprehension which be particularly fear in this disease do not much trouble me and if be alone i should have be take it have be a less cheerless and more remote departure tis a kind of death that i do not think of the bad sort ti commonly short stupid without pain and console by the public condition without ceremony without mourn without a crowd but a to the people about u the hundredth part of them could not be save in this place my large revenue be manual what an hundred men plough for me lay a long time fallow but then what example of resolution do we not see in the simplicity of all this people generally every one renounce all care of life the grape the principal wealth of the country remain untouched upon the vine every man indifferently prepare for and expect death either tonight or tomorrow with a countenance and voice so far from fear a if they have come to term with this necessity and that it be an universal and inevitable sentence ti always such but how slender hold have the resolution of die the distance and difference of a few hour the sole consideration of company render it apprehension various to u observe these people by reason that they die in the same month child young people and old they be no longer astonish at it they no longer lament i saw some who be afraid of stay behind a in a dreadful solitude and i do not commonly observe any other solicitude amongst them than that of sepulture they be trouble to see the dead body scatter about the field at the mercy of the wild beast that presently flock thither how differing be the fancy of men the neorites a nation subject by alexander throw the body of their dead into the deep and less frequented part of their wood on purpose to have them there eat the only sepulture repute happy amongst them some who be yet in health dig their own graf other lay themselves down in them whilst alive and a labourer of mine in die with hi hand and foot pull the earth upon him wa not this to nestle and settle himself to sleep at great ease a bravery in some sort like that of the roman soldier who after the battle of cannae be find with their head thrust into hole in the earth which they have make and in suffocate themselves with their own hand pull the earth about their ear in short a whole province be by the common usage at once bring to a course nothing inferior in undaunted to the most studied and premeditate resolution most of the instruction of science to encourage u herein have in them more of show than of force and more of ornament than of effect we have abandon nature and will teach her what to do teach her who so happily and so securely conduct u and in the meantime from the footstep of her instruction and that little which by the benefit of ignorance remains of her image imprint in the life of this rustic rout of unpolished men science be constrain every day to borrow pattern for her disciple of constancy tranquillity and innocence it be pretty to see that these person full of so much fine knowledge have to imitate this foolish simplicity and this in the primary action of virtue and that our wisdom must learn even from beast the most profitable instruction in the great and most necessary concern of our life a how we be to live and die manage our property love and bring up our child maintain justice a singular testimony of human infirmity and that this reason we so handle at our pleasure find evermore some diversity and novelty leaf in u no apparent trace of nature men have do with nature a perfumer with oil they have sophisticate her with so many argumentation and farfetched discourse that she be become variable and particular to each and have lose her proper constant and universal face so that we must seek testimony from beast not subject to favour corruption or diversity of opinion it be indeed true that even these themselves do not always go exactly in the path of nature but wherein they swerve it be so little that you may always see the track a horse that be lead make many bound and curvet but ti always at the length of the halter and still follow him that lead them and a a young hawk take it flight but still under the restraint of it tether what good will this curiosity do u to anticipate all the inconvenience of human nature and to prepare ourselves with so much trouble against thing which peradventure will never befall u not only the blow but the wind of the blow strike u or like phrenetic people for certainly it be a phrensy to go immediately and whip yourself because it may so fall out that fortune may one day make you undergo it and to put on your furred gown at midsummer because you will stand in need of it at christmas throw yourselves say they into the experience of all the evil the most extreme evil that can possibly befall you and so be assure of them on the contrary the most easy and most natural way would be to banish even the thought of them they will not come soon enough their true be will not continue with u long enough our mind must lengthen and extend them we must incorporate them in u beforehand and there entertain them a if they would not otherwise sufficiently press upon our sens we shall find them heavy enough when they come say one of our master of none of the tender sect but of the most severe in the meantime favour thyself believe what please thee best what good will it do thee to anticipate thy ill fortune to lose the present for fear of the future and to make thyself miserable now because thou art to be so in time these be hi word science indeed do u one good office in instruct u exactly a to the dimension of evil twere pity that any part of their greatness should escape our sense and knowledge ti certain that for the most part the preparation for death have administer more torment than the thing itself it be of old truly say and by a very judicious author the sentiment of present death sometimes of itself animate u with a prompt resolution not to avoid a thing that be utterly inevitable many gladiator have be see in the olden time who after have fight timorously and ill have courageously entertain death offer their throat to the enemy sword and bid them despatch the sight of future death require a courage that be slow and consequently hard to be get if you know not how to die never trouble yourself nature will at the time fully and sufficiently instruct you she will exactly do that business for you take you no care we trouble life by the care of death and death by the care of life the one torment the other fright u it be not against death that we prepare that be too momentary a thing a quarter of an hour suffer without consequence and without damage do not deserve especial precept to say the truth we prepare ourselves against the preparation of death philosophy ordain that we should always have death before our eye to see and consider it before the time and then give u rule and precaution to provide that this foresight and thought do u no harm just so do physician who throw u into disease to the end they may have whereon to employ their drug and their art if we have not know how to live ti injustice to teach u how to die and make the end difform from all the rest if we have know how to live firmly and quietly we shall know how to die so too they may boast as much a they please but i fancy that though it be the end it be not the aim of life ti it end it extremity but not nevertheless it object it ought itself to be it own aim and design it true study be to order govern and suffer itself in the number of several other office that the general and principal chapter of know how to live comprehends be this article of know how to die and do not our fear give it weight one of the light too to judge of them by utility and by the naked truth the lesson of simplicity be not much inferior to those which learn teach u nay quite the contrary men differ in sentiment and force we must lead them to their own good accord to their capacity and by various way i never saw any peasant among my neighbour cogitate with what countenance and assurance he should pass over hi last hour nature teach him not to think of death till he be die and then he do it with a good grace than aristotle upon whom death press with a double weight both of itself and from so long a premeditation and therefore it be the opinion of caesar that the least premeditated death be the easy and the most happy the sharpness of this imagination spring from our curiosity ti thus we ever impede ourselves desire to anticipate and regulate natural prescript it be only for the doctor to dine bad for it when in the best health and to frown at the image of death the common sort stand in need of no remedy or consolation but just in the shock and when the blow come and consider ont no more than just what they endure be it not then a we say that the stolidity and want of apprehension in the vulgar give them that patience m present evil and that profound carelessness of future sinister accident that their soul in be more gross and dull be less penetrable and not so easily move if it be so let u henceforth in god name teach nothing but ignorance tis the utmost fruit the science promise u to which this stolidity so gently lead it disciple we have no want of good master interpreter of natural simplicity socrates shall be one for a i remember he speak something to this purpose to the judge who sit upon hi life and death i be afraid my master that if i entreat you not to put me to death i shall confirm the charge of my accuser which be that i pretend to be wise than other a have some more secret knowledge of thing that be above and below u i have neither frequent nor know death nor have ever see any person that have try it quality from whom to inform myself such a fear it presuppose they know it a for my part i neither know what it be nor what they do in the other world death be peradventure an indifferent thing peradventure a thing to be desire ti nevertheless to be believe if it be a transmigration from one place to another that it be a bettering of one condition to go and live with so many great person decease and to be exempt from have any more to do with unjust and corrupt judge if it be an annihilation of our be ti yet a bettering of one condition to enter into a long and peaceable night we find nothing more sweet in life than quiet repose and a profound sleep without dream the thing that i know to be evil a to injure one neighbour and to disobey one superior whether it be god or man i carefully avoid such a i do not know whether they be good or evil i can not fear them if i be to die and leave you alive the god alone only know whether it will go well with you or with me wherefore a to what concern me you may do a you shall think fit but accord to my method of advise just and profitable thing i say that you will do your conscience more right to set me at liberty unless you see far into my cause than i do and judge accord to my past action both public and private accord to my intention and accord to the profit that so many of our citizen both young and old daily extract from my conversation and the fruit that you all reap from me you can not more duly acquit yourselves towards my merit than in order that my poverty consider i should be maintain at the prytanaeum at the public expense a thing that i have often know you with less reason grant to other do not impute it to obstinacy or disdain that i do not accord to the custom supplicate and go about to move you to commiseration i have both friend and kindred not be a homer say begotten of wood or of stone no more than other who might well present themselves before you with tear and mourn and i have three desolate child with whom to move you to compassion but i should do a shame to our city at the age i be and in the reputation of wisdom which be now charge against me to appear in such an abject form what would men say of the other athenian i have always admonish those who have frequent my lecture not to redeem their life by an unbecoming action and in the war of my country at amphipolis potidea delia and other expedition where i have be i have effectually manifest how far i be from secure my safety by my shame i should moreover compromise your duty and should invite you to unbecoming thing for ti not for my prayer to persuade you but for the pure and solid reason of justice you have swear to the god to keep yourselves upright and it would seem a if i suspect you or would recriminate upon you that i do not believe that you be so and i should testify against myself not to believe them a i ought mistrust their conduct and not purely commit my affair into their hand i wholly rely upon them and hold myself assure they will do in this what shall be most fit both for you and for me good men whether living or dead have no reason to fear the god be not this an innocent child plead of an unimaginable loftiness true frank and just unexampled and in what a necessity employ truly he have very good reason to prefer it before that which the great orator lysias have pen for him admirably couch indeed in the judiciary style but unworthy of so noble a criminal had a suppliant voice be hear out of the mouth of socrates that lofty virtue have strike sail in the height of it glory and ought hi rich and powerful nature to have commit her defence to art and in her high proof have renounce truth and simplicity the ornament of hi speaking to adorn and deck herself with the embellishment of figure and the flourish of a premeditated speech he do very wisely and like himself not to corrupt the tenor of an incorrupt life and so sacred an image of the human form to spin out hi decrepitude another year and to betray the immortal memory of that glorious end he owe hi life not to himself but to the example of the world have it not be a public damage that he should have conclude it after a lazy and obscure manner assuredly that careless and indifferent consideration of hi death deserve that posterity should consider it so much the more a indeed they do and there be nothing so just in justice than that which fortune ordain for hi recommendation for the athenian abominate all those who have be causers of hi death to such a degree that they avoid them a excommunicate person and look upon everything a polluted that have be touch by them no one would wash with them in the public bath none would salute or own acquaintance with them so that at last unable long to support this public hatred they hang themselves if any one shall think that amongst so many other example that i have to choose out of in the saying of socrates for my present purpose i have make an ill choice of this and shall judge this discourse of hi elevate above common conception i must tell them that i have properly select it for i be of another opinion and hold it to be a discourse in rank and simplicity much below and behind common conception he represent in an inartificial boldness and infantine security the pure and first impression and ignorance of nature for it be to be believe that we have naturally a fear of pain but not of death by reason of itself tis a part of our be and no less essential than live to what end should nature have beget in u a hatred to it and a horror of it consider that it be of so great utility to her in maintain the succession and vicissitude of her work and that in this universal republic it conduce more to birth and augmentation than to loss or ruin the failing of one life be the passage to a thousand other live nature have imprint in beast the care of themselves and of their conservation they proceed so far a hit or hurt to be timorous of be bad of themselves of our haltering and beat them accident subject to their sense and experience but that we should kill them they can not fear nor have they the faculty to imagine and conclude such a thing a death it be say indeed that we see them not only cheerfully undergo it horse for the most part neighing and swan sing when they die but moreover seek it at need of which elephant have give many example besides the method of arguing of which socrates here make use be it not equally admirable both in simplicity and vehemence truly it be much more easy to speak like aristotle and to live like caesar than to speak and live a socrates do there lie the extreme degree of perfection and difficulty art can not reach it now our faculty be not so trained up we do not try we do not know them we invest ourselves with those of other and let our own lie idle a some one may say of me that i have here only make a nosegay of foreign flower have furnish nothing of my own but the thread to tie them certainly i have so far yield to public opinion that those borrow ornament accompany me but i do not mean that they shall cover me and hide me that be quite contrary to my design who desire to make a show of nothing but what be my own and what be my own by nature and have i take my own advice i have at all hazard speak purely alone i more and more load myself every day beyond my purpose and first method upon the account of idleness and the humour of the age if it misbecome me a i believe it do tis no matter it may be of use to some other such there be who quote plato and homer who never saw either of them and i also have take thing out of place far enough distant from their source without pain and without learn have a thousand volumes about me in the place where i write i can presently borrow if i please from a dozen such scrapgatherers people about whom i do not much trouble myself wherewith to trick up this treatise of physiognomy there need no more but a preliminary epistle of a german to stuff me with quotation and so it be we go in quest of a tickle story to cheat the foolish world these lumber pie of commonplace wherewith so many furnish their study be of little use but to common subject and serve but to show u and not to direct u a ridiculous fruit of learn that socrates so pleasantly discus against euthydemus i have see book make of thing that be never either study or understand the author commit to several of hi learned friends the examination of this and tother matter to compile it content himself for hi share with have project the design and by hi industry to have tie together this faggot of unknown provision the ink and paper at least be hi this be to buy or borrow a book and not to make one ti to show men not that he can make a book but that whereof they may be in doubt he can not make one a president where i be boast that he have amass together two hundred and odd commonplace in one of hi judgment in tell which he deprive himself of the glory he have get by it in my opinion a pusillanimous and absurd vanity for such a subject and such a person i do the contrary and amongst so many borrow thing be glad if i can steal one disguising and alter it for some new service at the hazard of have it say that ti for want of understand it natural use i give it some particular touch of my own hand to the end it may not be so absolutely foreign these set their theft in show and value themselves upon them and so have more credit with the law than i have we naturalist i think that there be a great and incomparable preference in the honour of invention over that of allegation if i would have speak by learn i have speak sooner i have write of the time nearer to my study when i have more wit and good memory and should sooner have trust to the vigour of that age than of this would i have make a business of writing and what if this gracious favour which fortune have lately offer me upon the account of this work have befall me in that time of my life instead of this wherein tis equally desirable to possess soon to be lose two of my acquaintance great men in this faculty have in my opinion lose half in refuse to publish at forty year old that they might stay till threescore maturity have it defect as well a green year and bad and old age be a unfit for this kind of business a any other he who commit hi decrepitude to the press play the fool if he think to squeeze anything out thence that do not relish of dream dotage and drivel the mind grow costive and thick in grow old i deliver my ignorance in pomp and state and my learning meagrely and poorly this accidentally and accessorily that principally and expressly and write specifically of nothing but nothing nor of any science but of that inscience i have choose a time when my life which i be to give an account of lie wholly before me what remain have more to do with death and of my death itself should i find it a prate death a other do i would willingly give an account at my departure socrates be a perfect exemplar in all great quality and i be vexed that he have so deform a face and body a be say and so unsuitable to the beauty of hi soul himself be so amorous and such an admirer of beauty nature do him wrong there be nothing more probable than the conformity and relation of the body to the soul this refer to an unnatural ugliness and deformity of limb but we call ugliness also an unseemliness at first sight which be principally lodge in the face and disgust u on very slight ground by the complexion a spot a rugged countenance for some reason often wholly inexplicable in member nevertheless of good symmetry and perfect the deformity that clothe a very beautiful soul in la boetie be of this predicament that superficial ugliness which nevertheless be always the most imperious be of least prejudice to the state of the mind and of little certainty in the opinion of men the other which be never properly call deformity be more substantial strike deeply in not every shoe of smooth shin leather but every shoe wellmade shew the shape of the foot within a socrates say of hi it betray equal ugliness in hi soul have he not correct it by education but in say so i hold he be in jest a hi custom be never so excellent a soul form itself i can not often enough repeat how great an esteem i have for beauty that potent and advantageous quality he la boetie call it a short tyranny and plato the privilege of nature we have nothing that excel it in reputation it have the first place in the commerce of men it present itself in the front seduces and prepossess our judgment with great authority and wonderful impression phryne have lose her cause in the hand of an excellent advocate if open her robe she have not corrupt her judge by the lustre of her beauty and i find that cyrus alexander and caesar the three master of the world never neglect beauty in their great affair no more do the first scipio the same word in greek signifies both fair and good and the holy word often say good when it mean fair i should willingly maintain the priority in good thing accord to the song that plato call an idle thing take out of some ancient poet health beauty rich aristotle say that the right of command appertains to the beautiful and that when there be a person whose beauty come near the image of the god veneration be equally due to him to him who ask why people oftener and longer frequent the company of handsome person that question say he be only to be ask by the blind most of the philosopher and the great paid for their schooling and acquire wisdom by the favour and mediation of their beauty not only in the men that serve me but also in the beast i consider it within two finger breadth of goodness and yet i fancy that those feature and mould of face and those lineament by which men guess at our internal complexion and our fortune to come be a thing that do not very directly and simply lie under the chapter of beauty and deformity no more than every good odour and serenity of air promise health nor all fog and stink infection in a time of pestilence such a accuse lady of contradict their beauty by their manner do not always hit right for in a face which be none of the best there may dwell some air of probity and trust a on the contrary i have read betwixt two beautiful eye menace of a dangerous and malignant nature there be favourable physiognomy so that in a crowd of victorious enemy you shall presently choose amongst men you never saw before one rather than another to whom to surrender and with whom to intrust your life and yet not properly upon the consideration of beauty a person look be but a feeble warranty and yet it be something considerable too and if i have to lash them i would most severely scourge the wicked one who belie and betray the promise that nature have plant in their forehead i should with great severity punish malice under a mild and gentle aspect it seem a if there be some lucky and some unlucky face and i believe there be some art in distinguish affable from merely simple face severe from rugged malicious from pensive scornful from melancholic and such other border quality there be beauty which be not only haughty but sour and other that be not only gentle but more than that insipid to prognosticate from them future event be a matter that i shall leave undecided i have a i have say elsewhere a to my own concern simply and implicitly embrace this ancient rule that we can not fail in follow nature and that the sovereign precept be to conform ourselves to her i have not a socrates do correct my natural composition by the force of reason and have not in the least disturbed my inclination by art i have let myself go a i come i contend not my two principal part live of their own accord in peace and good intelligence but my nurse milk thank god be tolerably wholesome and good shall i say this by the way that i see in great esteem than ti worth and in use solely among ourselves a certain image of scholastic probity a slave to precept and fetter with hope and fear i would have it such a that law and religion should not make but perfect and authorise it that find it have wherewithal to support itself without help bear and root in u from the seed of universal reason imprint in every man by nature that reason which strengthen socrates from hi vicious bend render him obedient to the god and men of authority in hi city courageous in death not because hi soul be immortal but because he be mortal ti a doctrine ruinous to all government and much more hurtful than ingenious and subtle which persuade the people that a religious belief be alone sufficient and without conduct to satisfy the divine justice use demonstrate to u a vast distinction betwixt devotion and conscience i have a favourable aspect both in form and in interpretation and that make a quite contrary show to that of socrates it have often befall me that upon the mere credit of my presence and air person who have no manner of knowledge of me have put a very great confidence in me whether in their own affair or mine and i have in foreign part thence obtain singular and rare favour but the two follow example be peradventure worth particular relation a certain person plan to surprise my house and me in it hi scheme be to come to my gate alone and to be importunate to be let in i know him by name and have fair reason to repose confidence in him a be my neighbour and something relate to me i cause the gate to be open to him a i do to every one there i find him with every appearance of alarm hi horse panting and very tire he entertain me with this story that about half a league off he have meet with a certain enemy of hi whom i also know and have hear of their quarrel that hi enemy have give him a very brisk chase and that have be surprise in disorder and hi party be too weak he have flee to my gate for refuge and that he be in great trouble for hi follower whom he say he conclude to be all either dead or take i innocently do my best to comfort assure and refresh him shortly after come four or five of hi soldier who present themselves in the same countenance and affright to get in too and after them more and still more very well mount and arm to the number of fiveandtwenty or thirty pretending that they have the enemy at their heel this mystery begin a little to awaken my suspicion i be not ignorant what an age i live in how much my house might be envy and i have several example of other of my acquaintance to whom a mishap of this sort have happen but think there be nothing to be get by have begin to do a courtesy unless i go through with it and that i could not disengage myself from them without spoil all i let myself go the most natural and simple way a i always do and invite them all to come in and in truth i be naturally very little inclined to suspicion and distrust i willingly incline towards excuse and the gentle interpretation i take men accord to the common order and do not more believe in those perverse and unnatural inclination unless convince by manifest evidence than i do in monster and miracle and i be moreover a man who willingly commit myself to fortune and throw myself headlong into her arm and i have hitherto find more reason to applaud than to blame myself for so do have ever find her more discreet about and a great friend to my affair than i be myself there be some action in my life whereof the conduct may justly be call difficult or if you please prudent of these suppose the third part to have be my own doubtless the other twothirds be absolutely hers we make methinks a mistake in that we do not enough trust heaven with our affair and pretend to more from our own conduct than appertains to u and therefore it be that our design so often miscarry heaven be jealous of the extent that we attribute to the right of human prudence above it own and cut it all the shorter by how much the more we amplify it the last comer remain on horseback in my courtyard whilst their leader who be with me in the parlour would not have hi horse put up in the stable say he should immediately retire so soon a he have news of hi men he saw himself master of hi enterprise and nothing now remain but it execution he have since several time say for he be not ashamed to tell the story himself that my countenance and frankness have snatch the treachery out of hi hand he again mount hi horse hi follower who have their eye intent upon him to see when he would give the signal be very much astonish to find him come away and leave hi prey behind him another time rely upon some truce just publish in the army i take a journey through a very ticklish country i have not ridden far but i be discover and two or three party of horse from various place be send out to seize me one of them overtake me on the third day and i be attack by fifteen or twenty gentleman in vizor follow at a distance by a band of footsoldiers i be take withdrawn into the thick of a neighbouring forest dismount robbed my trunk rifle my moneybox take and my horse and equipage divide amongst new master we have in this copse a very long contest about my ransom which they set so high that it be manifest that i be not know to them they be moreover in a very great debate about my life and in truth there be various circumstance that clearly show the danger i be in i still insist upon the truce too willing they should have the gain of what they have already take from me which be not to be despise without promise of any other ransom after two or three hour that we have be in this place and that they have mount me upon a horse that be not likely to run from them and commit me to the guard of fifteen or twenty harquebusiers and dispersed my servant to other have give order that they should carry u away prisoners several way and i be already get some two or three musketshots from the place behold a sudden and unexpected alteration i saw the chief return to me with gentler language make search amongst the trooper for my scattered property and causing as much a could be recover to be restore to me even to my moneybox but the best present they make be my liberty for the rest do not much concern me at that time the true cause of so sudden a change and of this reconsideration without any apparent impulse and of so miraculous a repentance in such a time in a plan and deliberate enterprise and become just by usage for at the first dash i plainly confess to them of what party i be and whither i be go truly i do not yet rightly understand the most prominent amongst them who pull off hi vizor and tell me hi name repeatedly tell me at the time over and over again that i owe my deliverance to my countenance and the liberty and boldness of my speech that render me unworthy of such a misadventure and should secure me from it repetition ti possible that the divine goodness will to make use of this vain instrument for my preservation and it moreover defend me the next day from other and bad ambush of which these my assailant have give me warn the last of these two gentleman be yet live himself to tell the story the first be kill not long ago if my face do not answer for me if men do not read in my eye and in my voice the innocence of intention i have not live so long without quarrel and without give offence see the indiscreet whatever come into my head and to judge so rashly of thing this way may with reason appear uncivil and ill adapt to our way of conversation but i have never meet with any who judge it outrageous or malicious or that take offence at my liberty if he have it from my own mouth word repeat have another kind of sound and sense nor do i hate any person and i be so slow to offend that i can not do it even upon the account of reason itself and when occasion have require me to sentence criminal i have rather choose to fail in point of justice than to do it aristotle ti say be reproach for have be too merciful to a wicked man i be indeed say he merciful to the man but not to hi wickedness ordinary judgment exasperate themselves to punishment by the horror of the fact but it cool mine the horror of the first murder make me fear a second and the deformity of the first cruelty make me abhor all imitation of it that may be apply to me who be but a squire of club which be say of charillus king of sparta he can not be good seeing he be not evil even to the wicked or thus for plutarch delivers it both these way a he do a thousand other thing variously and contradictorily he must needs be good because he be so even to the wicked even a in lawful action i dislike to employ myself when for such a be displease at it so to say the truth in unlawful thing i do not make conscience enough of employ myself when it be for such a be willing there be no desire more natural than that of knowledge we try all way that can lead u to it where reason be want we therein employ experience which be a means much more weak and cheap but truth be so great a thing that we ought not to disdain any mediation that will guide u to it reason have so many form that we know not to which to take experience have no few the consequence we would draw from the comparison of event be unsure by reason they be always unlike there be no quality so universal in this image of thing a diversity and variety both the greek and the latin and we for the most express example of similitude employ that of egg and yet there have be men particularly one at delphos who could distinguish mark of difference amongst egg so well that he never mistake one for another and have many hen could tell which have lay it dissimilitude intrude itself of itself in our work no art can arrive at perfect similitude neither perrozet nor any other can so carefully polish and blanch the back of hi card that some gamest will not distinguish them by see them only shuffle by another resemblance do not so much make one a difference make another nature have oblige herself to make nothing other that be not unlike and yet i be not much please with hi opinion who think by the multitude of law to curb the authority of judge in cut out for them their several parcel he be not aware that there be as much liberty and latitude in the interpretation of law a in their form and they but fool themselves who think to lessen and stop our dispute by recall u to the express word of the bible forasmuch a our mind do not find the field less spacious wherein to controvert the sense of another than to deliver hi own and a if there be less animosity and tartness in commentary than in invention we see how much he be mistake for we have more law in france than all the rest of the world put together and more than would be necessary for the government of all the world of epicurus and yet we have leave so much to the opinion and decision of our judge that there never be so full a liberty or so full a license what have our legislator gain by cull out a hundred thousand particular case and by apply to these a hundred thousand law this number hold no manner of proportion with the infinite diversity of human action the multiplication of our invention will never arrive at the variety of example add to these a hundred time a many more it will still not happen that of event to come there shall one be find that in this vast number of million of event so choose and record shall so tally with any other one and be so exactly couple and match with it that there will not remain some circumstance and diversity which will require a diverse judgment there be little relation betwixt our action which be in perpetual mutation and fix and immutable law the most to be desire be those that be the most rare the most simple and general and i be even of opinion that we have well have none at all than to have them in so prodigious a number a we have nature always give them good and happy than those we make ourselves witness the picture of the golden age of the poet and the state wherein we see nation live who have no other some there be who for their only judge take the first passerby that travel along their mountain to determine their cause and other who on their market day choose out some one amongst them upon the spot to decide their controversy what danger would there be that the wise amongst u should so determine ours accord to occurrence and at sight without obligation of example and consequence for every foot it own shoe king ferdinand send colony to the indie wisely provide that they should not carry along with them any student of jurisprudence for fear l suit should get foot in that new world a be a science in it own nature breeder of altercation and division judging with plato that lawyer and physician be bad institution of a country whence do it come to pass that our common language so easy for all other us become obscure and unintelligible in will and contract and that he who so clearly express himself in whatever els he speak or writes can not find in these any way of declare himself that do not fall into doubt and contradiction if it be not that the prince of that art apply themselves with a peculiar attention to cull out portentous word and to contrive artificial sentence have so weigh every syllable and so thoroughly sift every sort of quirk connection that they be now confound and entangle in the infinity of figure and minute division and can no more fall within any rule or prescription nor any certain intelligence a you see child try to bring a mass of quicksilver to a certain number of part the more they press and work it and endeavour to reduce it to their own will the more they irritate the liberty of this generous metal it evade their endeavour and sprinkle itself into so many separate body a frustrate all reckon so be it here for in subdivide these subtilties we teach men to increase their doubt they put u into a way of extend and diversify difficulty and lengthen and disperse them in sow and retail question they make the world fructify and increase in uncertainty and dispute a the earth be make fertile by be crumble and dug deep we doubt of ulpian and be still now more perplexed with bartolus and baldus we should efface the trace of this innumerable diversity of opinion not adorn ourselves with it and fill posterity with crotchet i know not what to say to it but experience make it manifest that so many interpretation dissipate truth and break it aristotle write to be understood if he could not do this much less will another that be not so good at it and a third than he who express hi own thought we open the matter and spill it in pour out of one subject we make a thousand and in multiplying and subdivide them fall again into the infinity of atom of epicurus never do two men make the same judgment of the same thing and ti impossible to find two opinion exactly alike not only in several men but in the same man at diverse hour i often find matter of doubt in thing of which the commentary have disdain to take notice i be most apt to stumble in an even country like some horse that i have know that make most trip in the smooth way who will not say that gloss augment doubt and ignorance since theres no book to be find either human or divine which the world busy itself about whereof the difficulty be clear by interpretation the hundredth commentator pass it on to the next still more knotty and perplexed than he find it when be we ever agree amongst ourselves this book have enough there be now no more to be say about it this be most apparent in the law we give the authority of law to infinite doctor infinite decree and a many interpretation yet do we find any end of the need of interpret be there for all that any progress or advancement towards peace or do we stand in need of any few advocate and judge than when this great mass of law be yet in it first infancy on the contrary we darken and bury intelligence we can no longer discover it but at the mercy of so many fence and barrier men do not know the natural disease of the mind it do nothing but ferret and inquire and be eternally wheel juggling and perplex itself like silkworm and then suffocate itself in it work mu in pice it think it discover at a great distance i know not what glimpse of light and imaginary truth but whilst run to it so many difficulty hindrance and new inquisition cross it that it lose it way and be make drunk with the motion not much unlike aesop dog that see something like a dead body float in the sea and not be able to approach it set to work to drink the water and lay the passage dry and so choked themselves to which what one crate say of the writing of heraclitus fall pat enough that they require a reader who could swim well so that the depth and weight of hi learning might not overwhelm and stifle him ti nothing but particular weakness that make u content with what other or ourselves have find out in this chase after knowledge one of good understanding will not rest so content there be always room for one to follow nay even for ourselves and another road there be no end of our inquisition our end be in the other world ti a sign either that the mind have grow shortsighted when it be satisfied or that it have get weary no generous mind can stop in itself it will still tend far and beyond it power it have sally beyond it effect if it do not advance and press forward and retire and rush and wheel about ti but half alive it pursuit be without bound or method it aliment be admiration the chase ambiguity which apollo sufficiently declare in always speak to u in a double obscure and oblique sense not feed but amuse and puzzle u ti an irregular and perpetual motion without model and without aim it invention heat pursue and interproduce one another estienne de la boetie thus translate by cotton there be more ado to interpret interpretation than to interpret thing and more book upon book than upon any other subject we do nothing but comment upon one another every place swarm with commentary of author there be great scarcity be it not the principal and most reputed knowledge of our late age to understand the learn be it not the common and final end of all study our opinion be graft upon one another the first serve a a stock to the second the second to the third and so forth thus step by step we climb the ladder whence it come to pass that he who be mount high have often more honour than merit for he be get up but an inch upon the shoulder of the last but one how often and peradventure how foolishly have i extend my book to make it speak of itself foolishly if for no other reason but this that it should remind me of what i say of other who do the same that the frequent amorous glance they cast upon their work witness that their heart pant with selflove and that even the disdainful severity wherewith they scourge them be but the dandlings and caressing of maternal love a aristotle whose valuing and undervalue himself often spring from the same air of arrogance my own excuse be that i ought in this to have more liberty than other forasmuch a i write specifically of myself and of my writing a i do of my other action that my theme turn upon itself but i know not whether other will accept this excuse i observe in germany that luther have leave a many division and dispute about the doubt of hi opinion and more than he himself raise upon the holy scripture our contest be verbal i ask what nature be what pleasure circle and substitution be the question be about word and be answer accordingly a stone be a body but if a man should further urge and what be a body substance and what be substance and so on he would drive the respondent to the end of hi calepin we exchange one word for another and often for one less understood i good know what man be than i know what animal be or mortal or rational to satisfy one doubt they give me three ti the hydra head socrates ask menon what virtue be there be say menon the virtue of a man and of a woman of a magistrate and of a private person of an old man and of a child very fine cry socrates we be in quest of one virtue and thou hast bring u a whole swarm we put one question and they return u a whole hive a no event no face entirely resemble another so do they not entirely differ an ingenious mixture of nature if our face be not alike we could not distinguish man from beast if they be not unlike we could not distinguish one man from another all thing hold by some similitude every example halt and the relation which be draw from experience be always faulty and imperfect comparison be evercoupled at one end or other so do the law serve and be fit to every one of our affair by some wrest bias and force interpretation since the ethic law that concern the particular duty of every one in himself be so hard to be frame a we see they be tis no wonder if those which govern so many particular be much more so do but consider the form of this justice that govern u tis a true testimony of human weakness so full be it of error and contradiction what we find to be favour and severity in justice and we find so much of them both that i know not whether the medium be as often meet with be sickly and unjust member of the very body and essence of justice some country people have just bring me news in great haste that they presently leave in a forest of mine a man with a hundred wound upon him who be yet breathe and beg of them water for pitys sake and help to carry him to some place of relief they tell me they durst not go near him but have run away l the officer of justice should catch them there and a happens to those who be find near a murder person they should be call in question about this accident to their utter ruin have neither money nor friend to defend their innocence what could i have say to these people tis certain that this office of humanity would have bring them into trouble how many innocent people have we know that have be punish and this without the judge fault and how many that have not arrive at our knowledge this happen in my time certain men be condemn to die for a murder commit their sentence if not pronounce at least determined and conclude on the judge just in the nick be inform by the officer of an inferior court hard by that they have some men in custody who have directly confess the murder and make an indubitable discovery of all the particular of the fact yet it be gravely deliberated whether or not they ought to suspend the execution of the sentence already pass upon the first accuse they consider the novelty of the example judicially and the consequence of reverse judgment that the sentence be pass and the judge deprive of repentance and in the result these poor devil be sacrifice by the form of justice philip or some other provide against a like inconvenience after this manner he have condemn a man in a great fine towards another by an absolute judgment the truth some time after be discover he find that he have pass an unjust sentence on one side be the reason of the cause on the other side the reason of the judicial form he in some sort satisfy both leave the sentence in the state it be and out of hi own purse recompense the condemned party but he have to do with a reparable affair my men be irreparably hang how many condemnation have i see more criminal than the crime themselves all which make me remember the ancient opinion that ti of necessity a man must do wrong by retail who will do right in gross and injustice in little thing who would come to do justice in great that human justice be form after the model of physic accord to which all that be useful be also just and honest and of what be hold by the stoic that nature herself proceed contrary to justice in most of her work and of what be receive by the cyrenaics that there be nothing just of itself but that custom and law make justice and what the theodorians hold that theft sacrilege and all sort of uncleanness be just in a sage if he know them to be profitable to him there be no remedy i be in the same case that alcibiades be that i will never if i can help it put myself into the hand of a man who may determine a to my head where my life and honour shall more depend upon the skill and diligence of my attorney than on my own innocence i would venture myself with such justice a would take notice of my good deed as well a my ill where i have as much to hope a to fear indemnity be not sufficient pay to a man who do good than not to do amiss our justice present to u but one hand and that the left hand too let him be who he may he shall be sure to come off with loss in china of which kingdom the government and art without commerce with or knowledge of ours surpass our example in several excellent feature and of which the history teach me how much great and more various the world be than either the ancient or we have be able to penetrate the officer depute by the prince to visit the state of hi province a they punish those who behave themselves ill in their charge so do they liberally reward those who have conduct themselves good than the common sort and beyond the necessity of their duty these there present themselves not only to be approve but to get not simply to be pay but to have a present make to them no judge thank god have ever yet speak to me in the quality of a judge upon any account whatever whether my own or that of a third party whether criminal or civil nor no prison have ever receive me not even to walk there imagination render the very outside of a jail displeasing to me i be so enamoured of liberty that should i be interdict the access to some corner of the indie i should live a little less at my ease and whilst i can find earth or air open elsewhere i shall never lurk in any place where i must hide myself my god how ill should i endure the condition wherein i see so many people nail to a corner of the kingdom deprive of the right to enter the principal city and court and the liberty of the public road for have quarrel with our law if those under which i live should shake a finger at me by way of menace i would immediately go seek out other let them be where they would all my little prudence in the civil war wherein we be now engage be employ that they may not hinder my liberty of go and come now the law keep up their credit not for be just but because they be law ti the mystic foundation of their authority they have no other and it well answer their purpose they be often make by fool still oftener by men who out of hatred to equality fail in equity but always by men vain and irresolute author there be nothing so much nor so grossly nor so ordinarily faulty a the law whoever obey them because they be just do not justly obey them a he ought our french law by their irregularity and deformity lend in some sort a help hand to the disorder and corruption that all manifest in their dispensation and execution the command be so perplexed and inconstant that it in some sort excuse alike disobedience and defect in the interpretation the administration and the observation of it what fruit then soever we may extract from experience that will little advantage our institution which we draw from foreign example if we make so little profit of that we have of our own which be more familiar to u and doubtless sufficient to instruct u in that whereof we have need i study myself more than any other subject ti my metaphysic my physic in this universality i suffer myself to be ignorantly and negligently lead by the general law of the world i shall know it well enough when i feel it my learn can not make it alter it course it will not change itself for me tis folly to hope it and a great folly to concern one self about it see it be necessarily alike public and common the goodness and capacity of the governor ought absolutely to discharge u of all care of the government philosophical inquisition and contemplation serve for no other use but to increase our curiosity the philosopher with great reason send u back to the rule of nature but they have nothing to do with so sublime a knowledge they falsify them and present u her face paint with too high and too adulterate a complexion whence spring so many different picture of so uniform a subject a she have give u foot to walk with so have she give u prudence to guide u in life not so ingenious robust and pompous a prudence a that of their invention but yet one that be easy quiet and salutary and that very well perform what the other promise in him who have the good luck to know how to employ it sincerely and regularly that be to say accord to nature the most simply to commit one self to nature be to do it most wisely oh what a soft easy and wholesome pillow be ignorance and incuriosity whereon to repose a wellordered head i have rather understand myself well in myself than in cicero of the experience i have of myself i find enough to make me wise if i be but a good scholar whoever will call to mind the excess of hi past anger and to what a degree that fever transport him will see the deformity of this passion good than in aristotle and conceive a more just hatred against it whoever will remember the ill he have undergone those that have threaten him and the light occasion that have remove him from one state to another will by that prepare himself for future change and the knowledge of hi condition the life of caesar have no great example for u than our own though popular and of command ti still a life subject to all human accident let u but listen to it we apply to ourselves all whereof we have principal need whoever shall call to memory how many and many time he have be mistake in hi own judgment be he not a great fool if he do not ever after suspect it when i find myself convince by the reason of another of a false opinion i do not so much learn what he have say to me that be new and the particular ignorance that would be no great acquisition a in general i learn my own debility and the treachery of my understanding whence i extract the reformation of the whole mass in all my other error i do the same and find from this rule great utility to life i regard not the specie and individual a a stone that i have stumble at i learn to suspect my step throughout and be careful to place them right to learn that a man have say or do a foolish thing be nothing a man must learn that he be nothing but a fool a much more ample and important instruction the false step that my memory have so often make even then when it be most secure and confident of itself be not idly throw away it vainly swear and assure me i shake my ear the first opposition that be make to it testimony put me into suspense and i durst not rely upon it in anything of moment nor warrant it in another person concern and be it not that what i do for want of memory other do more often for want of good faith i should always in matter of fact rather choose to take the truth from anothers mouth than from my own if every one would pry into the effect and circumstance of the passion that sway him a i have do into those which i be most subject to he would see them come and would a little break their impetuosity and career they do not always seize u on a sudden there be threaten and degree judgment hold in me a magisterial seat at least it carefully endeavour to make it so it leave my appetite to take their own course hatred and friendship nay even that i bear to myself without change or corruption if it can not reform the other part accord to it own model at least it suffer not itself to be corrupt by them but play it game apart the advice to every one to know themselves should be of important effect since that god of wisdom and light cause it to be write on the front of hi temple a comprehend all he have to advise u plato say also that prudence be no other thing than the execution of this ordinance and socrates minutely verify it in xenophon the difficulty and obscurity be not discern in any science but by those who be get into it for a certain degree of intelligence be require to be able to know that a man know not and we must push against a door to know whether it be bolt against u or no whence this platonic subtlety spring that neither they who know be to enquire forasmuch a they know nor they who do not know forasmuch a to inquire they must know what they inquire of so in this of know a man self that every man be see so resolved and satisfied with himself that every man think himself sufficiently intelligent signifies that every one know nothing about the matter a socrates give euthydemus to understand i who profess nothing els therein find so infinite a depth and variety that all the fruit i have reap from my learn serf only to make me sensible how much i have to learn to my weakness so often confess i owe the propension i have to modesty to the obedience of belief prescribe me to a constant coldness and moderation of opinion and a hatred of that troublesome and wrangle arrogance wholly believe and trust in itself the capital enemy of discipline and truth do but hear them domineer the first fopperies they utter ti in the style wherewith men establish religion and law aristarchus say that anciently there be scarce seven sage to be find in the world and in hi time scarce so many fool have not we more reason than he to say so in this age of ours affirmation and obstinacy be express sign of want of wit this fellow may have knock hi nose against the ground a hundred time in a day yet he will be at hi ergo a resolute and sturdy a before you would say he have have some new soul and vigour of understand infuse into him since and that it happen to him a to that ancient son of the earth who take fresh courage and vigour by hi fall do not this incorrigible coxcomb think that he assume a new understanding by undertake a new dispute ti by my own experience that i accuse human ignorance which be in my opinion the sure part of the worlds school such a will not conclude it in themselves by so vain an example a mine or their own let them believe it from socrates the master of master for the philosopher antisthenes say to hi disciple let u go and hear socrates there i will be a pupil with you and maintain this doctrine of the stoic sect that virtue be sufficient to make a life completely happy have no need of any other thing whatever except of the force of socrates add he that long attention that i employ in consider myself also fit rile to judge tolerably enough of other and there be few thing whereof i speak well and with good excuse i happen very often more exactly to see and distinguish the quality of my friend than they do themselves i have astonish some with the pertinence of my description and have give them warn of themselves by have from my infancy be accustom to contemplate my own life in those of other i have acquire a complexion studious in that particular and when i be once interit upon it i let few thing about me whether countenance humour or discourse that serve to that purpose escape me i study all both what i be to avoid and what i be to follow also in my friend i discover by their production their inward inclination not by arrange this infinite variety of so diverse and unconnected action into certain specie and chapter and distinctly distribute my parcel and division under know head and class the wise speak and deliver their fancy more specifically and piece by piece i who see no far into thing than as use informs me present mine generally without rule and experimentally i pronounce my opinion by disjointed article a a thing that can not be speak at once and in gross relation and conformity be not to be find in such low and common soul a ours wisdom be a solid and entire building of which every piece keep it place and bear it mark i leave it to artist and i know not whether or no they will be able to bring it about in so perplexed minute and fortuitous a thing to marshal into distinct body this infinite diversity of face to settle our inconstancy and set it in order i do not only find it hard to piece our action to one another but i moreover find it hard properly to design each by itself by any principal quality so ambiguous and variform they be with diverse light that which be remark for rare in perseus king of macedon that hi mind fix itself to no one condition wander in all sort of living and represent manner so wild and erratic that it be neither know to himself or any other what kind of man he be seem almost to fit all the world and especially i have see another of hi make to whom i think this conclusion might more properly be apply no moderate settled still run headlong from one extreme to another upon occasion not to be guess at no line of path without traverse and wonderful contrariety no one quality simple and unmixed so that the best guess men can one day make will be that he affect and study to make himself know by be not to be know a man have need have sound ear to hear himself frankly criticise and a there be few who can endure to hear it without be nettle those who hazard the undertaking it to u manifest a singular effect of friendship for ti to love sincerely indeed to venture to wind and offend u for our own good i think it harsh to judge a man whose ill quality be more than hi good one plato require three thing in him who will examine the soul of another knowledge benevolence boldness i be sometimes ask what i should have think myself fit for have any one design to make use of me while i be of suitable year for nothing say i and i willingly excuse myself from know anything which enslave me to other but i have tell the truth to my master and have regulate hi manner if he have so pleased not in gross by scholastic lesson which i understand not and from which i see no true reformation spring in those that do but by observe them by leisure at all opportunity and simply and naturally judge them a an eyewitness distinctly one by one give him to understand upon what term he be in the common opinion in opposition to hi flatterer there be none of u who would not be bad than king if so continually corrupt a they be with that sort of canaille how if alexander that great king and philosopher can not defend himself from them i should have have fidelity judgment and freedom enough for that purpose it would be a nameless office otherwise it would lose it grace and it effect and tis a part that be not indifferently fit for all men for truth itself have not the privilege to be speak at all time and indiscriminately it use noble a it be have it circumspection and limit it often fall out a the world go that a man let it slip into the ear of a prince not only to no purpose but moreover injuriously and unjustly and no man shall make me believe that a virtuous remonstrance may not be viciously apply and that the interest of the substance be not often to give way to that of the form for such a purpose i would have a man who be content with hi own fortune and of moderate station forasmuch a on the one hand he would not be afraid to touch hi master heart to the quick for fear by that mean of lose hi preferment and on the other hand be of no high quality he would have more easy communication with all sort of people i would have this office limit to only one person for to allow the privilege of hi liberty and privacy to many would beget an inconvenient irreverence and of that one i would above all thing require the fidelity of silence a king be not to be believe when he brag of hi constancy in stand the shock of the enemy for hi glory if for hi profit and amendment he can not stand the liberty of a friend advice which have no other power but to pinch hi ear the remainder of it effect be still in hi own hand now there be no condition of men whatever who stand in so great need of true and free advice and warn a they do they sustain a public life and have to satisfy the opinion of so many spectator that a those about them conceal from them whatever should divert them from their own way they insensibly find themselves involve in the hatred and detestation of their people often upon occasion which they might have avoid without any prejudice even of their pleasure themselves have they be advise and set right in time their favourite commonly have more regard to themselves than to their master and indeed it answer with them forasmuch a in truth most office of real friendship when apply to the sovereign be under a rude and dangerous hazard so that therein there be great need not only of very great affection and freedom but of courage too in fine all this hodgepodge which i scribble here be nothing but a register of the essay of my own life which for the internal soundness be exemplary enough to take instruction against the grain but a to bodily health no man can furnish out more profitable experience than i who present it pure and no way corrupt and change by art or opinion experience be properly upon it own dunghill in the subject of physic where reason wholly give it place tiberius say that whoever have live twenty year ought to be responsible to himself for all thing that be hurtful or wholesome to him and know how to order himself without physic and he might have learn it of socrates who advise hi disciple to be solicitous of their health a a chief study add that it be hard if a man of sense have a care to hi exercise and diet do not well know than any physician what be good or ill for him and physic itself profess always to have experience for the test of it operation so plato have reason to say that to be a right physician it would be necessary that he who would become such should first himself have pass through all the disease he pretend to cure and through all the accident and circumstance whereof he be to judge ti but reason they should get the pox if they will know how to cure it for my part i should put myself into such hand the other but guide u like him who paint sea and rock and port sit at table and there make the model of a ship sailing in all security but put him to the work itself he know not at which end to begin they make such a description of our malady a a town crier do of a lost horse or dog such a color such a height such an ear but bring it to him and he know it not for all that if physic should one day give me some good and visible relief then truly i will cry out in good earnest the art that promise to keep our body and soul in health promise a great deal but withal there be none that less keep their promise and in our time those who make profession of these art amongst u less manifest the effect than any other sort of men one may say of them at the most that they sell medicinal drug but that they be physicians a man can not say i have live long enough to be able to give an account of the custom that have carry me so far for him who have a mind to try it a hi taster i have make the experiment here be some of the article a my memory shall supply me with them i have no custom that have not vary accord to circumstance but i only record those that i have be best acquaint with and that hitherto have have the great possession of me my form of life be the same in sickness a in health the same bed the same hour the same meat and even the same drink serve me in both condition alike i add nothing to them but the moderation of more or less accord to my strength and appetite my health be to maintain my wonted state without disturbance i see that sickness put me off it on one side and if i will be rule by the physician they will put me off on the other so that by fortune and by art i be out of my way i believe nothing more certainly than this that i can not be hurt by the use of thing to which i have be so long accustomed ti for custom to give a form to a mans life such a it please him she be all in all in that ti the potion of circe that vary our nature a she best please how many nation and but three step from u think the fear of the nightdew that so manifestly be hurtful to u a ridiculous fancy and our own waterman and peasant laugh at it you make a german sick if you lay him upon a mattress a you do an italian if you lay him on a featherbed and a frenchman if without curtain or fire a spanish stomach can not hold out to eat a we can nor ours to drink like the swiss a german make me very merry at augsburg by find fault with our hearth by the same argument which we commonly make use of in decry their stove for to say the truth the smother heat and then the smell of that heated matter of which the fire be compose very much offend such a be not use to them not me and indeed the heat be always equal constant and universal without flame without smoke and without the wind that come down our chimney they may many way sustain comparison with ours why do we not imitate the roman architecture for they say that anciently fire be not make in the house but on the outside and at the foot of them whence the heat be convey to the whole fabric by pipe contrive in the wall which be draw twin about the room that be to be warm which i have see plainly describe somewhere in seneca this german hear me commend the convenience and beauty of hi city which truly deserve it begin to compassionate me that i have to leave it and the first inconvenience he allege to me be the heaviness of head that the chimney elsewhere would bring upon me he have hear some one make this complaint and fix it upon u be by custom deprive of the mean of perceive it at home all heat that come from the fire weaken and dull me evenus say that fire be the best condiment of life i rather choose any other way of make myself warm we be afraid to drink our wine when toward the bottom of the cask in portugal those fume be repute delicious and it be the beverage of prince in short every nation have many custom and usage that be not only unknown to other nation but savage and miraculous in their sight what should we do with those people who admit of no evidence that be not in print who believe not men if they be not in a book nor truth if it be not of competent age we dignify our fopperies when we commit them to the press ti of a great deal more weight to say i have read such a thing than if you only say i have hear such a thing but i who no more disbelieve a man mouth than hi pen and who know that men write as indiscreetly a they speak and who look upon this age a one that be past a soon quote a friend a aulus gelliusor macrobius and what i have see a what they have write and a tis held of virtue that it be not great for have continue longer so do i hold of truth that for be old it be none the wiser i often say that it be mere folly that make u run after foreign and scholastic example their fertility be the same now that it be in the time of homer and plato but be it not that we seek more honour from the quotation than from the truth of the matter in hand a if it be more to the purpose to borrow our proof from the shop of vascosan or plantin than from what be to be see in our own village or els indeed that we have not the wit to cull out and make useful what we see before u and to judge of it clearly enough to draw it into example for if we say that we want authority to give faith to our testimony we speak from the purpose forasmuch a in my opinion of the most ordinary common and known thing could we but find out their light the great miracle of nature might be form and the most wonderful example especially upon the subject of human action now upon this subject set aside the example i have gather from book and what aristotle say of andron the argian that he travel over the arid sand of lybia without drink a gentleman who have very well behave himself in several employment say in a place where i be that he have ride from madrid to lisbon in the heat of summer without any drink at all he be very healthful and vigorous for hi age and have nothing extraordinary in the use of hi life but this to live sometimes two or three month nay a whole year a he have tell me without drink he be sometimes thirsty but he let it pas over and he hold that it be an appetite which easily go off of itself and he drink more out of caprice than either for need or pleasure here be another example ti not long ago that i find one of the learned men in france among those of not inconsiderable fortune study in a corner of a hall that they have separate for him with tapestry and about him a rabble of hi servant full of licence he tell me and seneca almost say the same of himself he make an advantage of this hubbub that beat with this noise he so much the more collected and retire himself into himself for contemplation and that this tempest of voice drive back hi thought within himself be a student at padua he have hi study so long situate amid the rattle of coach and the tumult of the square that he not only form himself to the contempt but even to the use of noise for the service of hi study socrates answer alcibiades who be astonish how he could endure the perpetual scolding of hi wife why say he a those do who be accustom to the ordinary noise of wheel draw water i be quite otherwise i have a tender head and easily discompose when ti bent upon anything the least buzzing of a fly murder it seneca in hi youth have warmly espouse the example of sextius of eat nothing that have die for a whole year dispense with such food and a he say with pleasure and discontinue it that he might not be suspect of take up this rule from some new religion by which it be prescribe he adopt in like manner from the precept of attalus a custom not to lie upon any sort of bed that give way under hi weight and even to hi old age make use of such a would not yield to any pressure what the usage of hi time make him account roughness that of ours make u look upon a effeminacy do but observe the difference betwixt the way of living of my labourer and my own the scythian and indian have nothing more remote both from my capacity and my form i have pick up charity boy to serve me who soon after have quit both my kitchen and livery only that they might return to their former course of life and i find one afterwards pick mussel out of the sewer for hi dinner whom i could neither by entreaty nor threat reclaim from the sweetness he find in indigence beggar have their magnificence and delight as well a the rich and ti say their dignity and polity these be the effect of custom she can mould u not only into what form she please the sage say we ought to apply ourselves to the best which she will soon make easy to u but also to change and variation which be the most noble and most useful instruction of all she teach u the best of my bodily condition be that i be flexible and not very obstinate i have inclination more my own and ordinary and more agreeable than other but i be divert from them with very little ado and easily slip into a contrary course a young man ought to cross hi own rule to awaken hi vigour and to keep it from grow faint and rusty and there be no course of life so weak and sottish a that which be carry on by rule and discipline he shall often throw himself even into excess if he will take my advice otherwise the least debauch will destroy him and render him troublesome and disagreeable in company the bad quality in a wellbred man be overfastidiousness and an obligation to a certain particular way and it be particular if not pliable and supple it be a kind of reproach not to be able or not to dare to do what we see those about u do let such a these stop at home it be in every man unbecoming but in a soldier vicious and intolerable who a philopcemen say ought to accustom himself to every variety and inequality of life though i have be bring up as much a be possible to liberty and independence yet so it be that grow old and have by indifference more settled upon certain form my age be now past instruction and have henceforward nothing to do but to keep itself up as well a it can custom have already ere i be aware so imprinted it character in me in certain thing that i look upon it a a kind of excess to leave them off and without a force upon myself can not sleep in the daytime nor eat between meal nor breakfast nor go to bed without a great interval betwixt eating and sleep a of three hour after supper nor get child but before i sleep nor get them stand nor endure my own sweat nor quench my thirst either with pure water or pure wine nor keep my head long bare nor cut my hair after dinner and i should be a uneasy without my glove a without my shirt or without wash when i rise from table or out of my bed and i could not lie without a canopy and curtain a if they be essential thing i could dine without a tablecloth but without a clean napkin after the german fashion very incommodiously i foul them more than the german or italian do and make but little use either of spoon or fork i complain that they do not keep up the fashion begin after the example of king to change our napkin at every service a they do our plate we be tell of that laborious soldier marius that grow old he become nice in hi drink and never drink but out of a particular cup of hi own i in like manner have suffer myself to fancy a certain form of glass and not willingly to drink in common glass no more than from a strange common hand all metal offend me in comparison of a clear and transparent matter let my eye taste too accord to their capacity i owe several other such nicety to custom nature have also on the other side help me to some of hers a not to be able to endure more than two full meal in one day without overcharge my stomach nor a total abstinence from one of those meal without fill myself with wind dry up my mouth and dull my appetite the finding great inconvenience from overmuch even air for of late year in night march which often happen to be all night long after five or six hour my stomach begin to be queasy with a violent pain in my head so that i always vomit before the day can break when the other go to breakfast i go to sleep and when i rise i be a brisk and gay a before i have always be tell that the night dew never rise but in the beginning of the night but for some year past long and familiar intercourse with a lord possess with the opinion that the night dew be more sharp and dangerous about the decline of the sun an hour or two before it set which he carefully avoids and despise that of the night he almost impress upon me not so much hi reason a hi experience what shall mere doubt and inquiry strike our imagination so a to change u such a absolutely and on a sudden give way to these propensions draw total destruction upon themselves i be sorry for several gentleman who through the folly of their physician have in their youth and health wholly shut themselves up it be good to endure a cough than by disuse for ever to lose the commerce of common life in thing of so great utility malignant science to interdict u the most pleasant hour of the day let u keep our possession to the last for the

them except to such if there be any such where obligation and servitude be of profit both king and philosopher go to stool and ladies too public life be bind to ceremony mine that be obscure and private enjoys all natural dispensation soldier and gascon be also qualities a little subject to indiscretion wherefore i shall say of this act of relieve nature that it be desirable to refer it to certain prescribed and nocturnal hour and compel one self to this by custom a i have do but not to subject one self a i have do in my decline year to a particular convenience of place and seat for that purpose and make it troublesome by long sitting and yet in the fouler office be it not in some measure excusable to require more care and cleanliness of all the action of nature i be the most impatient of be interrupt in that i have see many soldier trouble with the unruliness of their belly whereas mine and i never fail of our punctual assignation which be at leap out of bed if some indispensable business or sickness do not molest u i think then a i say before that sick men can not better place themselves anywhere in more safety than in sit still in that course of life wherein they have be breed and train up change be it what it will distemper and put one out do you believe that chestnut can hurt a perigordin or a lucchese or milk and cheese the mountain people we enjoin

walk you will deprive them of motion and in the end of air and light if they do no other good they do this at least that they prepare patient betimes for death by little and little undermining and cut off the use of life both well and sick i have ever willingly suffer myself to obey the appetite that press upon me i give great rein to my desire and propensity i do not love to cure one disease by another i hate remedy that be more troublesome than the disease itself to be subject to the colic and subject to abstain from eat oyster be two evil instead of one the disease torment u on the one side and the remedy on the other since we be ever in danger of mistake let u rather run the hazard of a mistake after we have have the pleasure the world proceed quite the other way and think nothing profitable that be not painful it have great suspicion of facility my appetite in various thing have of it own accord happily enough accommodate itself to the health of my stomach relish and pungency in sauce be pleasant to me when young my stomach dislike them since my taste incontinently follow wine be hurtful to sick people and tis the first thing that my mouth then find distasteful and with an invincible dislike whatever i take against my liking do me harm and nothing hurt me that i eat with appetite and delight i never receive harm by any action that be very pleasant to me and accordingly have make all medicinal conclusion largely give way to my pleasure and i have when i be young give myself the rein a licentiously and inconsiderately to the desire that be predominant in me a any other whomsoever yet more in continuation and hold out than in sally ti certainly a misfortune and a miracle at once to confess at what a tender age i first come under the subjection of love it be indeed by chance for it be long before the year of choice or knowledge i do not remember myself so far back and my fortune may well be couple with that of quartilla who could not remember when she be a maid physician modify their rule accord to the violent longing that happen to sick person ordinarily with good success this great desire can not be imagine so strange and vicious but that nature must have a hand in it and then how easy a thing be it to satisfy the fancy in my opinion this part wholly carry it at least above all the rest the most grievous and ordinary evil be those that fancy load u with this spanish saying plea me in several aspect i be sorry when i be sick that i have not some longing that might give me the pleasure of satisfy it all the rule of physic would hardly be able to divert me from it i do the same when i be well i can see very little more to be hop or wish for twere pity a man should be so weak and languish a not to have even wish leave to him the art of physic be not so fixed that we need be without authority for whatever we do it change accord to climate and moon accord to fernel and to scaliger if your physician do not think it good for you to sleep to drink wine or to eat such and such meat never trouble yourself i will find you another that shall not be of hi opinion the diversity of medical argument and opinion embrace all sort and form i saw a miserable sick person pant and burn for thirst that he might be cure who be afterwards laugh at for hi pain by another physician who condemn that advice a prejudicial to him have he not torment himself to good purpose there lately die of the stone a man of that profession who have make use of extreme abstinence to contend with hi disease hi fellowphysicians say that on the contrary this abstinence have dry him up and bake the gravel in hi kidney i have observe that both in wound and sickness speak discomposes and hurt me as much a any irregularity i can commit my voice pain and tire me for ti loud and force so that when i have go to a whisper some great person about affair of consequence they have often desire me to moderate my voice this story be worth a diversion some one in a certain greek school speak loud a i do the master of the ceremony send to him to speak softly tell him then he must send me reply the other the tone he would have me speak in to which the other reply that he should take the tone from the ear of him to whom he spake it be well say if it be to be understood speak accord to the affair you be speak about to your auditor for if it mean tis sufficient that he hear you or govern yourself by him i do not find it to be reason the tone and motion of my voice carry with it a great deal of the expression and signification of my meaning and ti i who be to govern it to make myself understood there be a voice to instruct a voice to flatter and a voice to reprehend i will not only that my voice reach him but peradventure that it strike and pierce him when i rate my valet with sharp and bitter language it would be very pretty for him to say pray master speak low i hear you very well speaking be half hi who speak and half hi who hear the latter ought to prepare himself to receive it accord to it bias a with tennisplayers he who receive the ball shift and prepares accord a he see him move who strike the stroke and accord to the stroke itself experience have moreover teach me this that we ruin ourselves by impatience evil have their life and limit their disease and their recovery the constitution of malady be form by the pattern of the constitution of animal they have their fortune and their day limit from their birth he who attempt imperiously to cut them short by force in the middle of their course lengthens and multiplies them and incense instead of appease them i be of crantors opinion that we be neither obstinately and deafly to oppose evil nor succumb to them from want of courage but that we be naturally to give way to them accord to their condition and our own we ought to grant free passage to diseases i find they stay less with me who let them alone and i have lose some repute the most tenacious and obstinate by their own decay without help and without art and contrary to it rule let u a little permit nature to take her own way she good understand her own affair than we but such an one died of it and so shall you if not of that disease of another and how many have not escape die who have have three physician at their tail example be a vague and universal mirror and of various reflection if it be a

mexican teach their child so soon a ever they be bear they thus salute them thou art come into the world child to endure endure suffer and say nothing ti injustice to lament that which have befall any one which may befall every one see an old man who beg of god that he will maintain hi health vigorous and entire that be to say that he restore him to youth be it not folly hi condition be not capable of it the gout the stone and indigestion be symptom of long year a heat rain and wind be of long journey plato do not believe that aesculapius trouble himself to provide by regimen to prolong life in a weak and waste body useless to hi country and to hi profession or to beget healthful and robust child and do not think this care suitable to the divine justice and prudence which be to direct all thing to utility my good friend your business be do nobody can restore you they can at the most but patch you up and prop you a little and by that mean prolong your misery an hour or two we must learn to suffer what we can not evade our life like the harmony of the world be compose of contrary thing of diverse tone sweet and harsh sharp and flat sprightly and solemn the musician who should only affect some of these what would he be able to do he must know how to make use of them all and to mix them and so we should mingle the good and evil which be consubstantial with our life our be can not subsist without this mixture and the one part be no less necessary to it than the other to attempt to combat natural necessity be to represent the folly of ctesiphon who undertake to kick with hi mule i consult little about the alteration i feel for these doctor take advantage when they have you at their mercy they surfeit your ear with their prognostic and formerly surprising me weaken with sickness injuriously handle me with their dogma and magisterial fopperies one while menace me with great pain and another with approach death hereby i be indeed move and shake but not subdue nor jostle from my place and though my judgment be neither alter nor distract yet it be at least disturbed ti always agitation and combat now i use my imagination as gently a i can and would discharge it if i could of all trouble and contest a man must assist flatter and deceive it if he can my mind be fit for that office it need no appearance throughout could it persuade a it preach it would successfully relieve me will you have an example it tell me that ti for my good to have the stone that the structure of my age must naturally suffer some decay and it be now time it should begin to disjoin and to confess a breach ti a common necessity and there be nothing in it either miraculous or new i therein pay what be due to old age and i can not expect a good bargain that society ought to comfort me be fall into the most common infirmity of my age i see everywhere men torment with the same disease and be honour by the fellowship forasmuch a men of the best quality be most frequently afflict with it tis a noble and dignified disease that of such a be strike with it few have it to a less degree of pain that these be put to the trouble of a strict diet and the daily taking of nauseous potion whereas i owe my good state purely to my good fortune for some ordinary broth of eringo or burstwort that i have twice or thrice take to oblige the lady who with great kindness than my pain be sharp would need present me half of theirs seem to me equally easy to take and fruitless in operation the other have to pay a thousand vow to aesculapius and a many crown to their physician for the void a little gravel which i often do by the aid of nature even the decorum of my countenance be not disturb in company and i can hold my water ten hour and as long a any man in health the fear of this disease say my mind formerly affright thee when it be unknown to thee the cry and despair groan of those who make it bad by their impatience beget a horror in thee ti an infirmity that punish the member by which thou hast most offended thou art a conscientious fellow consider this chastisement ti very easy in comparison of other and inflict with a paternal tenderness do but observe how late it come it only seize on and incommodes that part of thy life which be one way and another sterile and lose have a it be by composition give time for the licence and pleasure of thy youth the fear and the compassion that the people have of this disease serve thee for matter of glory a quality whereof if thou bast thy judgment purify and that thy reason have somewhat cure it thy friend notwithstanding discern some tincture in thy complexion ti a pleasure to hear it say of oneself what strength of mind what patience thou art see to sweat with pain to turn pale and red to tremble to vomit blood to suffer strange contraction and convulsion at time to let great tear drop from thine eye to urine thick black and dreadful water or to have it suppress by some sharp and craggy stone that cruelly prick and tear the neck of the bladder whilst all the while thou entertainest the company with an ordinary countenance droning by fit with thy people make one in a continuous discourse now and then make excuse for thy pain and represent thy suffer less than it be dost thou call to mind the men of past time who so greedily seek disease to keep their virtue in breath and exercise put the case that nature set thee on and impels thee to this glorious school into which thou wouldst never have enter of thy own free will if thou tellest me that it be a dangerous and mortal disease what other be not so for ti a physical cheat to expect any that they say do not go direct to death what matter if they go thither by accident or if they easily slide and slip into the path that lead u to it but thou dost not die because thou art sick thou diest because thou art live death kill thee without the help of sickness and sickness have defer death in some who have live long by reason that they think themselves always die to which may be add that a in wound so in disease some be medicinal and wholesome the stone be often no less longlived than you we see men with whom it have continue from their infancy even to their extreme old age and if they have not break company it would have be with them long still you more often kill it than it kill you and though it should present to you the image of approach death be it not a good office to a man of such an age to put him in mind of hi end and which be bad thou hast no longer anything that should make thee desire to be cure whether or no common necessity will soon call thee away do but consider how skilfully and gently she put thee out of concern with life and weans thee from the world not force thee with a tyrannical subjection like so many other infirmity which thou seest old men afflict withal that hold them in continual torment and keep them in perpetual and unintermitted weakness and pain but by warning and instruction at interval intermix long pause of repose a it be to give thee opportunity to meditate and ruminate upon thy lesson at thy own ease and leisure to give thee mean to judge aright and to assume the resolution of a man of courage it present to thee the state of thy entire condition both in good and evil and one while a very cheerful and another an insupportable life in one and the same day if thou embracest not death at least thou shakest hand with it once a month whence thou hast more cause to hope that it will one day surprise thee without menace and that be so often conduct to the waterside but still think thyself to be upon the accustomed term thou and thy confidence will at one time or another be unexpectedly waft over a man can not reasonably complain of disease that fairly divide the time with health i be oblige to fortune for have so often assault me with the same sort of weapon she form and fashion me by use hardens and habituates me so that i can know within a little for how much i shall be quit for want of natural memory i make one of paper and a any new symptom happen in my disease i set it down whence it fall out that have now almost pass through all sort of example if anything strike threatens me turn over these little loose note a the sybilline leave i never fail of find matter of consolation from some favourable prognostic in my past experience custom also make me hope good for the time to come for the conduct of this clear out have so long continued ti to be believe that nature will not alter her course and that no other bad accident will happen than what i already feel and besides the condition of this disease be not unsuitable to my prompt and sudden complexion when it assault me gently i be afraid for ti then for a great while but it have naturally brisk and vigorous excess it claw me to purpose for a day or two my kidney hold out an age without alteration and i have almost now live another since they change their state evil have their period as well a benefit peradventure the infirmity draw towards an end age weaken the heat of my stomach and it digestion be less perfect send this crude matter to my kidney why at a certain revolution may not the heat of my kidney be also abate so that they can no more petrify my phlegm and nature find out some other way of purgation year have evidently help me to drain certain rheum and why not these excrement which furnish matter for gravel but be there anything delightful in comparison of this sudden change when from an excessive pain i come by the voiding of a stone to recover a by a flash of lightning the beautiful light of health so free and full a it happen in our sudden and sharp colic be there anything in the pain suffer that one can counterpoise to the pleasure of so sudden an amendment oh how much do health seem the more pleasant to me after a sickness so near and so contiguous that i can distinguish them in the presence of one another in their great show when they appear in emulation a if to make head against and dispute it with one another a the stoic say that vice be profitably introduce to give value to and to set off virtue we can with good reason and less temerity of conjecture say that nature have give u pain for the honour and service of pleasure and indolence when socrates after hi fetter be knock off felt the pleasure of that itch which the weight of them have cause in hi leg he rejoice to consider the strict alliance betwixt pain and pleasure how they be link together by a necessary connection so that by turn they follow and mutually beget one another and cry out to good aesop that he ought out of this consideration to have take matter for a fine fable the bad that i see in other disease be that they be not so grievous in their effect a they be in their issue a man be a whole year in recover and all the while full of weakness and fear there be so much hazard and so many step to arrive at safety that there be no end ont before they have unmuffled you of a kerchief and then of a cap before they allow you to walk abroad and take the air to drink wine to lie with your wife to eat melon tis odds you relapse into some new distemper the stone have this privilege that it carry itself clean off whereas the other malady always leave behind them some impression and alteration that render the body subject to a new disease and lend a hand to one another those be excusable that content themselves with possess u without extend farther and introduce their follower but courteous and kind be those whose passage bring u any profitable issue since i have be trouble with the stone i find myself free from all other accident much more methinks than i be before and have never have any fever since i argue that the extreme and frequent vomiting that i be subject to purge me and on the other hand my distaste for this and that and the strange fast i be force to keep digest my peccant humour and nature with those stone void whatever there be in me superfluous and hurtful let them never tell me that it be a medicine too dear buy for what avail so many stink draught so many caustic incision sweat seton diet and so many other method of cure which often by reason we be not able to undergo their violence and importunity bring u to our graf so that when i have the stone i look upon it a physic when free from it a an absolute deliverance and here be another particular benefit of my disease which be that it almost play it game by itself and let me play mine if i have only courage to do it for in it great fury i have endure it ten hour together on horseback do but endure only you need no other regimen play run dine do this and tother if you can your debauch will do you more good than harm say as much to one that have the pox the gout or hernia the other disease have more universal obligation rack our action after another kind of manner disturb our whole order and to their consideration engage the whole state of life this only pinch the skin it leave the understanding and the will wholly at our own disposal and the tongue the hand and the foot it rather awaken than stupefies you the soul be strike with the ardour of a fever overwhelm with an epilepsy and displace by a sharp megrim and in short astound by all the disease that hurt the whole mass and the most noble part this never meddle with the soul if anything go amiss with her ti her own fault she betray dismount and abandon herself there be none but fool who suffer themselves to be persuade that this hard and massive body which be bake in our kidney be to be dissolve by drink wherefore when it be once stir there be nothing to be do but to give it passage and for that matter it will itself make one i moreover observe this particular convenience in it that it be a disease wherein we have little to guess at we be dispense from the trouble into which other disease throw u by the uncertainty of their cause condition and progress a trouble that be infinitely painful we have no need of consultation and doctoral interpretation the sens well enough inform u both what it be and where it be by suchlike argument weak and strong a cicero with the disease of hi old age i try to rock asleep and amuse my imagination and to dress it wound if i find them bad tomorrow i will provide new stratagem that this be true i be come to that pas of late that the least motion force pure blood out of my kidney what of that i move about nevertheless a before and ride after my hound with a juvenile and insolent ardour and hold that i have very good satisfaction for an accident of that importance when it cost me no more but a dull heaviness and uneasiness in that part tis some great stone that waste and consume the substance of my kidney and my life which i by little and little evacuate not without some natural pleasure a an excrement henceforward superfluous and troublesome now if i feel anything stir do not fancy that i trouble myself to consult my pulse or my urine thereby to put myself upon some annoy prevention i shall soon enough feel the pain without make it more and long by the disease of fear he who fear he shall suffer already suffer what he fear to which may be add that the doubt and ignorance of those who take upon them to expound the design of nature and her internal progression and the many false prognostic of their art ought to give u to understand that her way be inscrutable and utterly unknown there be great uncertainty variety and obscurity in what she either promise or threaten old age except which be an indubitable sign of the approach of death in all other accident i see few sign of the future whereon we may grind our divination i only judge of myself by actual sensation not by reason to what end since i be resolve to bring nothing to it but expectation and patience will you know how much i get by this observe those who do otherwise and who rely upon so many diverse persuasion and counsel how often the imagination press upon them without any bodily pain i have many time amuse myself be well and in safety and quite free from these dangerous attack in communicate them to the physician a then begin to discover themselves in me i undergo the decree of their dreadful conclusion be all the while quite at my ease and so much the more obliged to the favour of god and good satisfy of the vanity of this art there be nothing that ought so much to be recommend to youth a activity and vigilance our life be nothing but movement i bestir myself with great difficulty and be slow in everything whether in rise go to bed or eat seven of the clock in the morning be early for me and where i rule i never dine before eleven nor sup till after six i formerly attribute the cause of the fever and other disease i fell into to the heaviness that long sleep have bring upon me and have ever repent go to sleep again in the morning plato be more angry at excess of sleep than at excess of drinking i love to lie hard and alone even without my wife a king do pretty well cover with clothes they never warm my bed but since i have grow old they give me at need cloth to lay to my foot and stomach they find fault with the great scipio that he be a great sleeper not in my opinion for any other reason than that men be displeased that he alone should have nothing in him to be find fault with if i be anything fastidious in my way of live ti rather in my lying than anything els but generally i give way and accommodate myself as well a any one to necessity sleeping have take up a great part of my life and i yet continue at the age i now be to sleep eight or nine hour at one breath i wean myself with utility from this proneness to sloth and be evidently the good for so do i find the change a little hard indeed but in three day ti over and i see but few who live with less sleep when need require and who more constantly exercise themselves or to whom long journey be less troublesome my body be capable of a firm but not of a violent or sudden agitation i escape of late from violent exercise and such a make me sweat my limb grow weary before they be warm i can stand a whole day together and be never weary of walk but from my youth i have ever prefer to ride upon paved road on foot i get up to the haunch in dirt and little fellow a i be be subject in the street to be elbow and jostle for want of presence i have ever love to repose myself whether sit or lie with my heel a high or high than my seat there be no profession as pleasant a the military a profession both noble in it execution for valour be the stout proudest and most generous of all virtue and noble in it cause there be no utility either more universal or more just than the protection of the peace and greatness of one country the company of so many noble young and active men delight you the ordinary sight of so many tragic spectacles the freedom of the conversation without art a masculine and unceremonious way of living please you the variety of a thousand several action the encouraging harmony of martial music that ravish and inflame both your ear and souls the honour of this occupation nay even it hardship and difficulty which plato hold so light that in hi republic he make woman and child share in them be delightful to you you put yourself voluntarily upon particular exploit and hazard accord a you judge of their lustre and importance and a volunteer find even life itself excusably employ to fear common danger that concern so great a multitude of men not to dare to do what so many sort of soul what a whole people dare be for a heart that be poor and mean beyond all measure company encourage even child if other excel you in knowledge in gracefulness in strength or fortune you have alternative resource at your disposal but to give place to them in stability of mind you can blame no one for that but yourself death be more abject more languishing and troublesome in bed than in a fight fever and catarrh a painful and mortal a a musketshot whoever have fortify himself valiantly to bear the accident of common life need not raise hi courage to be a soldier i do not remember that i ever have the itch and yet scratch be one of nature sweetest gratification and so much at hand but repentance follow too near i use it most in my ear which be at interval apt to itch i come into the world with all my sens entire even to perfection my stomach be commodiously good a also be my head and my breath and for the most part uphold themselves so in the height of fever i have pass the age to which some nation not without reason have prescribe so just a term of life that they would not suffer men to exceed it and yet i have some intermission though short and inconstant so clean and sound a to be little inferior to the health and pleasantness of my youth i do not speak of vigour and sprightliness ti not reason they should follow me beyond their limit my face and eye presently discover my condition all my alteration begin there and appear somewhat bad than they really be my friend often pity me before i feel the cause in myself my lookingglass do not frighten me for even in my youth it have befall me more than once to have a scurvy complexion and of ill augury without any great consequence so that the physician not find any cause within answerable to that outward alteration attribute it to the mind and to some secret passion that torment me within but they be deceive if my body would govern itself as well accord to my rule a my mind do we should move a little more at our ease my mind be then not only free from trouble but moreover full of joy and satisfaction a it commonly be half by it complexion half by it design i be of the opinion that this temperature of my soul have often raise my body from it lapse this be often depressed if the other be not brisk and gay ti at least tranquil and at rest i have a quartan ague four or five month that make me look miserably ill my mind be always if not calm yet pleasant if the pain be without me the weakness and languor do not much afflict me i see various corporal faintings that beget a horror in me but to name which yet i should less fear than a thousand passion and agitation of the mind that i see about me i make up my mind no more to run tis enough that i can crawl along nor do i more complain of the natural decadence that i feel in myself than i regret that my duration shall not be a long and entire a that of an oak i have no reason to complain of my imagination i have have few thought in my life that have so much a broken my sleep except those of desire which have awaken without afflict me i dream but seldom and then of chimaera and fantastic thing commonly produce from pleasant thought and rather ridiculous than sad and i believe it to be true that dream be faithful interpreter of our inclination but there be art require to sort and understand them plato moreover say that tis the office of prudence to draw instruction of divination of future thing from dream i dont know about this but there be wonderful instance of it that socrates xenophon and aristotle men of irreproachable authority relate historian say that the atlantes never dream who also never eat any animal food which i add forasmuch a it be peradventure the reason why they never dream for pythagoras order a certain preparation of diet to beget appropriate dream mine be very gentle without any agitation of body or expression of voice i have see several of my time wonderfully disturb by them theon the philosopher walk in hi sleep and so do pericles servant and that upon the tile and top of the house i hardly ever choose my dish at table but take the next at hand and unwillingly change it for another a confusion of meat and a clatter of dish displease me as much a any other confusion i be easily satisfy with few dish and be an enemy to the opinion of favorinus that in a feast they should snatch from you the meat you like and set a plate of another sort before you and that tis a pitiful supper if you do not sate your guest with the rump of various fowl the beccafico only deserve to be all eaten i usually eat salt meat yet i prefer bread that have no salt in it and my baker never send up other to my table contrary to the custom of the country in my infancy what they have most to correct in me be the refusal of thing that child commonly best love a sugar sweetmeat and marchpane my tutor contend with this aversion to delicate thing a a kind of overnicety and indeed ti nothing els but a difficulty of taste in anything it apply itself to whoever cure a child of an obstinate liking for brown bread bacon or garlic cure him also of pamper hi palate there be some who affect temperance and plainness by wish for beef and ham amongst the partridge tis all very fine this be the delicacy of the delicate ti the taste of an effeminate fortune that disrelishes ordinary and accustomed thing not to make good cheer with what another be enjoy and to be curious in what a man eats be the essence of this vice there be indeed this difference that tis good to oblige one appetite to thing that be most easy to be have but tis always vice to oblige one self i formerly say a kinsman of mine be overnice who by be in our galley have unlearn the use of bed and to undress when he go to sleep if i have any son i should willingly wish them my fortune the good father that god give me who have nothing of me but the acknowledgment of hi goodness but truly tis a very hearty one send me from my cradle to be bring up in a poor village of hi and there continue me all the while i be at nurse and still longer bring me up to the mean and most common way of living never take upon yourselves and much less give up to your wife the care of their nurture leave the formation to fortune under popular and natural law leave it to custom to train them up to frugality and hardship that they may rather descend from rigour than mount up to it this humour of hi yet aim at another end to make me familiar with the people and the condition of men who most need our assistance consider that i should rather regard them who extend their arm to me than those who turn their back upon me and for this reason it be that he provide to hold me at the font person of the mean fortune to oblige and attach me to them nor have hi design succeed altogether ill for whether upon the account of the more honour in such a condescension or out of a natural compassion that have a very great power over me i have an inclination towards the meaner sort of people the faction which i should condemn in our war i should more sharply condemn flourishing and successful it will somewhat reconcile me to it when i shall see it miserable and overwhelm how willingly do i admire the fine humour of cheilonis daughter and wife to king of sparta whilst her husband cleombrotus in the commotion of her city have the advantage over leonidas her father she like a good daughter stick close to her father in all hi misery and exile in opposition to the conqueror but so soon a the chance of war turn she change her will with the change of fortune and bravely turn to her husband side whom she accompany throughout where hi ruin carry him admit a it appear to me no other choice than to cleave to the side that stand most in need of her and where she could best manifest her compassion i be naturally more apt to follow the example of flaminius who rather give hi assistance to those who have most need of him than to those who have power to do him good than i do to that of pyrrhus who be of an humour to truckle under the great and to domineer over the poor long sitting at table both trouble me and do me harm for be it that i be so accustomed when a child i eat all the while i sit therefore it be that at my own house though the meal there be of the short i usually sit down a little while after the rest after the manner of augustus but i do not imitate him in rise also before the rest on the contrary i love to sit still a long time after and to hear them talk provide i be none of the talker for i tire and hurt myself with speak upon a full stomach as much a i find it very wholesome and pleasant to argue and to strain my voice before dinner the ancient greek and roman have more reason than we in set apart for eat which be a principal action of life if they be not prevent by other extraordinary business many hour and the great part of the night eating and drinking more deliberately than we do who perform all our action posthaste and in extend this natural pleasure to more leisure and good use intermix with profitable conversation they whose concern it be to have a care of me may very easily hinder me from eat anything they think will do me harm for in such matter i never covet nor miss anything i do not see but withal if it once come in my sight ti in vain to persuade me to forbear so that when i design to fast i must be keep apart from the supper and must have only so much give me a be require for a prescribed collation for if to table i forget my resolution when i order my cook to alter the manner of dress any dish all my family know what it mean that my stomach be out of order and that i shall not touch it i love to have all meat that will endure it very little boil or roast and prefer them very high and even a to several quite go nothing but hardness generally offend me of any other quality i be a patient and indifferent a any man i have know so that contrary to the common humour even in fish it often happen that i find them both too fresh and too firm not for want of teeth which i ever have good even to excellence and which age do not now begin to threaten i have always be use every morning to rub them with a napkin and before and after dinner god be favourable to those whom he make to die by degree tis the only benefit of old age the last death will be so much the less painful it will kill but a half or a quarter of a man there be one tooth lately fall out without draw and without pain it be the natural term of it duration in that part of my be and several other be already dead other half dead of those that be most active and in the first rank during my vigorous year tis so i melt and steal away from myself what a folly it would be in my understanding to apprehend the height of this fall already so much advance a if it be from the very top i hope i shall not i in truth receive a principal consolation in meditate my death that it will be just and natural and that henceforward i can not herein either require or hope from destiny any other but unlawful favour men make themselves believe that we formerly have long life as well a great stature but they deceive themselves and solon who be of those elder time limit the duration of life to threescore and ten year i who have so much and so universally adore that the mean be best of the passed time and who have conclude the most moderate measure to be the most perfect shall i pretend to an immeasurable and prodigious old age whatever happen contrary to the course of nature may be troublesome but what come accord to her should always be pleasant and so say plato the death which be occasion by wound and disease be violent but that which come upon u old age conduct u to it be of all other the most easy and in some sort delicious death mix and confound itself throughout with life decay anticipate it hour and shoulder itself even into the course of our advance i have portrait of myself take at fiveandtwenty and fiveandthirty year of age i compare them with that lately draw how many time be it no longer me how much more be my present image unlike the former than unlike my die one it be too much to abuse nature to make her trot so far that she must be force to leave u and abandon our conduct our eye teeth leg and all the rest to the mercy of a foreign and haggard countenance and to resign u into the hand of art be weary of follow u herself i be not excessively fond either of salad or fruit except melon my father hat all sort of sauce i love them all eating too much hurt me but a to the quality of what i eat i do not yet certainly know that any sort of meat disagrees with me neither have i observe that either full moon or decrease autumn or spring have any influence upon me we have in u motion that be inconstant and unknown for example i find radish first grateful to my stomach since that nauseous and now again grateful in several other thing i find my stomach and appetite vary after the same manner i have change again and again from white wine to claret from claret to white wine i be a great lover of fish and consequently make my fast feast and feast fast and i believe what some people say that it be more easy of digestion than flesh a i make a conscience of eat flesh upon fishdays so do my taste make a conscience of mix fish and flesh the difference betwixt them seem to me too remote from my youth i have sometimes keep out of the way at meal either to sharpen my appetite against the next morning for a epicurus fast and make lean meal to accustom hi pleasure to make shift without abundance i on the contrary do it to prepare my pleasure to make good and more cheerful use of abundance or els i fast to preserve my vigour for the service of some action of body or mind for both the one and the other of these be cruelly dull in me by repletion and above all thing i hate that foolish coupling of so healthful and sprightly a goddess with that little belching god bloat with the fume of hi liquor or to cure my sick stomach or for want of fit company for i say a the same epicurus do that one be not so much to regard what he eat a with whom and i commend chilo that he would not engage himself to be at perianders feast till he be first inform who be to be the other guests no dish be so acceptable to me nor no sauce so appetising a that which be extract from society i think it more wholesome to eat more leisurely and less and to eat oftener but i would have appetite and hunger attend to i should take no pleasure to be feed with three or four pitiful and stinted repast a day after a medicinal manner who will assure me that if i have a good appetite in the morning i shall have the same at supper but we old fellow especially let u take the first opportune time of eating and leave to almanacmakers hope and prognostic the utmost fruit of my health be pleasure let u take hold of the present and know i avoid the invariable in these law of fast he who would have one form serve him let him avoid the continue it we harden ourselves in it our strength be there stupefy and lay asleep six month after you shall find your stomach so inured to it that all you have get be the loss of your liberty of do otherwise but to your prejudice i never keep my leg and thigh warmer in winter than in summer one simple pair of silk stocking be all i have suffer myself for the relief of my cold to keep my head warmer and my belly upon the account of my colic my disease in a few day habituate themselves thereto and disdain my ordinary provision we soon get from a coif to a kerchief over it from a simple cap to a quilt hat the trimming of the doublet must not merely serve for ornament there must be add a hare skin or a vulture skin and a cap under the hat follow this gradation and you will go a very fine way to work i will do nothing of the sort and would willingly leave off what i have begin if you fall into any new inconvenience all this be labour lose you be accustom to it seek out some other thus do they destroy themselves who submit to be pester with these enforce and superstitious rule they must add something more and something more after that there be no end ont for what concern our affair and pleasure it be much more commodious a the ancient do to lose one dinner and defer making good cheer till the hour of retirement and repose without break up a day and so be i formerly use to do a to health i since by experience find on the contrary that it be well to dine and that the digestion be well while awake i be not very use to be thirsty either well or sick my mouth be indeed apt to be dry but without thirst and commonly i never drink but with thirst that be create by eat and far on in the meal i drink pretty well for a man of my pitch in summer and at a relish meal i do not only exceed the limit of augustus who drink but thrice precisely but not to offend democritus rule who forbid that men should stop at four time a an unlucky number i proceed at need to the fifth glass about three halfpints for the little glass be my favourite and i like to drink them off which other people avoid a an unbecoming thing i mix my wine sometimes with half sometimes with the third part water and when i be at home by an ancient custom that my father physician prescribe both to him and himself they mix that which be design for me in the buttery two or three hour before ti bring in ti say that cranabs king of attica be the inventor of this custom of dilute wine whether useful or no i have hear dispute i think it more decent and wholesome for child to drink no wine till after sixteen or eighteen year of age the most usual and common method of living be the most become all particularity in my opinion be to be avoid and i should as much hate a german who mixed water with hi wine a i should a frenchman who drink it pure public usage give the law in these thing i fear a mist and fly from smoke a from the plague the first repair i fell upon in my own house be the chimney and house of office the common and insupportable defect of all old building and amongst the difficulty of war i reckon the choke dust they make u ride in a whole day together i have a free and easy respiration and my cold for the most part go off without offence to the lung and without a cough the heat of summer be more an enemy to me than the cold of winter for besides the incommodity of heat less remediable than cold and besides the force of the sunbeam that strike upon the head all glitter light offends my eye so that i could not now sit at dinner over against a flaming fire to dull the whiteness of paper in those time when i be more wont to read i lay a piece of glass upon my book and find my eye much relieve by it i be to this hour to the age of fiftyfour ignorant of the use of spectacle and i can see as far a ever i do or any other ti true that in the evening i begin to find a little disturbance and weakness in my sight if i read an exercise i have always find troublesome especially by night here be one step back and a very manifest one i shall retire another from the second to the third and so to the fourth so gently that i shall be stark blind before i shall be sensible of the age and decay of my sight so artificially do the fatal sister untwist our life and so i doubt whether my hearing begin to grow thick and you will see i shall have half lose it when i shall still lay the fault on the voice of those who speak to me a man must screw up hi soul to a high pitch to make it sensible how it ebb away my walking be quick and firm and i know not which of the two my mind or my body i have most to do to keep in the same state that preacher be very much my friend who can fix my attention a whole sermon through in place of ceremony where every one countenance be so starched where i have see the lady keep even their eye so fixed i could never order it so that some part or other of me do not lash out so that though i be seat i be never settle and a to gesticulation i be never without a switch in my hand walk or rid a the philosopher chrysippus maid say of her master that he be only drunk in hi leg for it be hi custom to be always kick them about in what place soever he sit and she say it when the wine have make all hi companion drunk he find no alteration in himself at all it may have be say of me from my infancy that i have either folly or quicksilver in my foot so much stirring and unsettled there be in them wherever they be place ti indecent besides the hurt it do to one health and even to the pleasure of eat to eat greedily a i do i often bite my tongue and sometimes my finger in my haste diogenes meet a boy eating after that manner give hi tutor a box on the ear there be men at rome that teach people to chew as well a to walk with a good grace i lose thereby the leisure of speak which give great relish to the table provide the discourse be suitable that be pleasant and short there be jealousy and envy amongst our pleasure they cross and hinder one another alcibiades a man who well understand how to make good cheer banish even music from the table that it might not disturb the entertainment of discourse for the reason a plato tell u that it be the custom of ordinary people to call fiddler and sing men to feast for want of good discourse and pleasant talk with which men of understand know how to entertain one another varro require all this in entertainment person of graceful presence and agreeable conversation who be neither silent nor garrulous neatness and delicacy both of meat and place and fair weather the art of din well be no slight art the pleasure not a slight pleasure neither the great captain nor the great philosopher have disdain the use or science of eat well my imagination have deliver three repast to the custody of my memory which fortune render sovereignly sweet to me upon several occasion in my more flourishing age my present state excludes me for every one accord to the good temper of body and mind wherein he then find himself furnishes for hi own share a particular grace and savour i who but crawl upon the earth hate this inhuman wisdom that will have u despise and hate all culture of the body i look upon it a an equal injustice to loath natural pleasure a to be too much in love with them xerxes be a blockhead who environ with all human delight propose a reward to him who could find out other but he be not much less so who cut off any of those pleasure that nature have provide for him a man should neither pursue nor avoid them but receive them i receive them i confess a little too warmly and kindly and easily suffer myself to follow my natural propensions we have no need to exaggerate their inanity they themselves will make u sufficiently sensible of it thank to our sick wetblanket mind that put u out of taste with them a with itself it treat both itself and all it receive one while well and another bad accord to it insatiable vagabond and versatile essence i who boast that i so curiously and particularly embrace the convenience of life find them when i most nearly consider them very little more than wind but what we be all wind throughout and moreover the wind itself more discreet than we love to bluster and shift from corner to corner and content itself with it proper office without desire stability and solidityqualities not it own the pure pleasures as well a the pure displeasures of the imagination say some be the great a be express by the balance of critolaiis ti no wonder it make them to it own liking and cut them out of the whole cloth of this i every day see notable example and peradventure to be desire but i who be of a mixed and heavy condition can not snap so soon at this one simple object but that i negligently suffer myself to be carry away with the present pleasure of the general human law intellectually sensible and sensibly intellectual the cyrenaic philosopher will have it that a corporal pain so corporal pleasure be more powerful both a double and a more just there be some a aristotle say who out of a savage kind of stupidity dislike them and i know other who out of ambition do the same why do they not moreover forswear breathe why do they not live of their own why not refuse light because it be gratuitous and cost them neither invention nor exertion let mar pallas or mercury afford them their light by which to see instead of venus cere and bacchus these boastful humour may counterfeit some content for what will not fancy do but a to wisdom there be no touch of it will they not seek the quadrature of the circle even when on their wife i hate that we should be enjoin to have our mind in the cloud when our body be at table i would not have the mind nail there nor wallow there i would have it take place there and sit but not lie down aristippus maintain nothing but the body a if we have no soul zeno comprehend only the soul a if we have no body both of them faultily pythagoras they say follow a philosophy that be all contemplation socrates one that be all conduct and action plato find a mean betwixt the two but they only say this for the sake of talk the true temperament be find in socrates and plato be much more socratic than pythagoric and it become him good when i dance i dance when i sleep i sleep nay when i walk alone in a beautiful orchard if my thought be some part of the time take up with external occurrence i some part of the time call them back again to my walk to the orchard to the sweetness of that solitude and to myself nature have motherlike observe this that the action she have enjoin u for our necessity should be also pleasurable to u and she invite u to them not only by reason but also by appetite and ti injustice to infringe her law when i see alike caesar and alexander in the midst of hi great business so fully enjoy human and corporal pleasure i do not say that he relax hi mind i say that he strengthen it by vigour of courage subject those violent employment and laborious thought to the ordinary usage of life wise have he believe the last be hi ordinary the first hi extraordinary vocation we be great fool he have pass hi life in idleness say we i have do nothing today what have you not live that be not only the fundamental but the most illustrious of your occupation have i be put to the management of great affair i should have make it see what i could do have you know how to meditate and manage

night from hi round to read and scan polybius in all security ti for little souls bury under the weight of affair not from them to know how clearly to disengage themselves not to know how to lay them aside and take them up again whether it be in jest or earnest that the theological and sorbonnical wine and their feast be turn into a proverb i find it reasonable they should dine so much more commodiously and pleasantly a they have profitably and seriously employ the morning in the exercise of their school the conscience of have well spend the other hour be the just and savoury sauce of the dinnertable the sage live after that manner and that inimitable emulation to virtue which astonish u both in the one and the other cato that humour of theirs so severe a even to be importunate gently submit itself and yield to the law of the human condition of venus and bacchus accord to the precept of their sect that require the perfect sage to be a expert and intelligent in the use of natural pleasure a in all other duty of life relaxation and facility methinks wonderfully honour and best become a strong and generous soul epaminondas do not think that to take part and that heartily in song and sport and dance with the young men of hi city be thing that in any way derogate from the honour of hi glorious victory and the perfect purity of manner that be in him and amongst so many admirable action of scipio the grandfather a person worthy to be repute of a heavenly extraction there be nothing that give him a great grace than to see him carelessly and childishly trifle at

hannibal and africa visit the school in sicily and attend philosophical lecture to the extent of arm the blind envy of hi enemy at rome nor be there anything more remarkable in socrates than that old a he be he find time to make himself taught dance and play upon instrument and think it time well spend this same man be see in an ecstasy standing upon hi foot a whole day and a night together in the presence of all the grecian army surprise and absorb by some profound think he be the first amongst so many valiant men of the army to run to the relief of alcibiades oppress with the enemy to shield him with hi own body and disengage him from the crowd by absolute force of arm it be he who in the delian battle raise and save xenophon when fall from hi horse and who amongst all the people of athens enrage a he be at so unworthy a spectacle first present himself to rescue theramenes whom the thirty tyrant be lead to execution by their satellite and desist not from hi bold enterprise but at the remonstrance of theramenes himself though he be only follow by two more in all he be see when court by a beauty with whom he be in love to maintain at need a severe abstinence he be see ever to go to the war and walk upon ice with bare foot to wear the same robe winter and summer to surpass all hi companion in patience of bear hardship and to eat no more at a feast than at hi own private dinner he be see for sevenandtwenty year together to endure hunger poverty the indocility of hi child and the nail of hi wife with the same countenance and in the end calumny tyranny imprisonment fetter and poison but be this man oblige to drink full bumper by any rule of civility he be also the man of the whole army with whom the advantage in drinking remain and he never refuse to play at noisettes nor to ride the hobbyhorse with child and it become him well for all action say philosophy equally become and equally honour a wise man we have enough wherewithal to do it and we ought never to be weary of present the image of this great man in all the pattern and form of perfection there be very few example of life full and pure and we wrong our teaching every day to propose to ourselves those that be weak and imperfect scarce good for any one service and rather pull u back corrupt rather than correctors of manner the people deceive themselves a man go much more easily indeed by the end where the extremity serve for a bound a stop and guide than by the middle way large and open and accord to art more than accord to nature but withal much less nobly and commend greatness of soul consist not so much in mount and in press forward a in know how to govern and circumscribe itself it take everything for great that be enough and demonstrate itself in prefer moderate to eminent thing there be nothing so fine and legitimate a well and duly to play the man nor science so arduous a well and naturally to know how to live this life and of all the infirmity we have tis the most barbarous to despise our be whoever have a mind to isolate hi spirit when the body be ill at ease to preserve it from the contagion let him by all mean do it if he can but otherwise let him on the contrary favour and assist it and not refuse to participate of it natural pleasure with a conjugal complacency bring to it if it be the wise moderation lest by indiscretion they should get confound with displeasure intemperance be the pest of pleasure and temperance be not it scourge but rather it season euxodus who therein establish the sovereign good and hi companion who set so high a value upon it taste it in it most charming sweetness by the mean of temperance which in them be singular and exemplary i enjoin my soul to look upon pain and pleasure with an eye equally regulate and equally firm but the one gaily and the other severely and so far a it be able to be careful to extinguish the one a to extend the other the judge rightly of good brings along with it the judge soundly of evil pain have something of the inevitable in it tender beginning and pleasure something of the evitable in it excessive end plato couple them together and will that it should be equally the office of fortitude to fight against pain and against the immoderate and charm blandishment of pleasure they be two fountain from which whoever draw when and as much a he need whether city man or beast be very fortunate the first be to be take medicinally and upon necessity and more scantily the other for thirst but not to drunkenness pain pleasure love and hatred be the first thing that a child be sensible of if when reason come they apply it to themselves that be virtue i have a special vocabulary of my own i pass away time when it be ill and uneasy but when ti good i do not pass it away i taste it over again and adhere to it one must run over the ill and settle upon the good this ordinary phrase of pastime and pass away the time represent the usage of those wise sort of people who think they can not do good with their life than to let them run out and slide away pass them over and baulk them and as much a they can ignore them and shun them a a thing of troublesome and contemptible quality but i know it to be another kind of thing and find it both valuable and commodious even in it late decay wherein i now enjoy it and nature have deliver it into our hand in such and so favourable circumstance that we have only ourselves to blame if it be troublesome to u or escape u unprofitably nevertheless i compose myself to lose mine without regret but withal a a thing that be perishable by it condition not that it molest or annoy me nor do it properly well become any not to be displease when they die except such a be pleased to live there be good husbandry in enjoy it i enjoy it double to what other do for the measure of it fruition depend upon our more or less application to it chiefly that i perceive mine to be so short in time i desire to extend it in weight i will stop the promptitude of it flight by the promptitude of my grasp and by the vigour of use it compensate the speed of it run away in proportion a the possession of life be more short i must make it so much deep and full other feel the pleasure of content and prosperity i feel it too as well a they but not a it pass and slip by one should study taste and ruminate upon it to render condign thanks to him who grant it to u they enjoy the other pleasure a they do that of sleep without know it to the end that even sleep itself should not so stupidly escape from me i have formerly cause myself to be disturb in my sleep so that i might the good and more sensibly relish and taste it i ponder with myself of content i do not skim over but sound it and i bend my reason now grown perverse and peevish to entertain it do i find myself in any calm composed be there any pleasure that tickle me i do not suffer it to dally with my sens only i associate my soul to it too not there to engage itself but therein to take delight not there to lose itself but to be present there and i employ it on it part to view itself in this prosperous state to weigh and appreciate it happiness and to amplify it it reckon how much it stand indebted to god that it conscience and the intestine passion be in repose that it have the body in it natural disposition orderly and competently enjoy the soft and soothing function by which he of hi grace be please to compensate the suffering wherewith hi justice at hi good pleasure chastise u it reflect how great a benefit it be to be so protected that which way soever it turn it eye the heaven be calm around it no desire no fear no doubt trouble the air no difficulty past present or to come that it imagination may not pass over without offence this consideration take great lustre from the comparison of different condition so it be that i present to my think in a thousand aspects those whom fortune or their own error carry away and torment and again those who more like to me so negligently and incuriously receive their good fortune those be folk who spend their time indeed they pass over the present and that which they possess to wait on hope and for shadow and vain image which fancy put before them which hasten and prolong their flight accord a they be pursue the fruit and end of their pursuit be to pursue a alexander say that the end of hi labour be to labour for my part then i love life and cultivate it such a it have please god to bestow it upon u i do not desire it should be without the necessity of eating and drinking and i should think it a not less excusable fail to wish it have be twice a long nor that we should support ourselves by put only a little of that drug into our mouth by which epimenides take away hi appetite and keep himself alive nor that we should stupidly beget child with our finger or heel but rather with reverence be it spoken that we might voluptuously beget them with our finger and heel nor that the body should be without desire and without titillation these be ungrateful and wicked complaint i accept kindly and with gratitude what nature have do for me be well pleased with it and proud of it a man do wrong to that great and omnipotent giver to refuse annul or disfigure hi gift all goodness himself he have make everything good of philosophical opinion i preferably embrace those that be most solid that be to say the most human and most our own my discourse be suitable to my manner low and humble philosophy play the child to my thinking when it put itself upon it ergo to preach to u that tis a barbarous alliance to marry the divine with the earthly the reasonable with the unreasonable the severe with the indulgent the honest with the dishonest that pleasure be a brutish quality unworthy to be taste by a wise man that the sole pleasure he extract from the enjoyment of a fair young wife be a pleasure of hi conscience to perform an action accord to order a to put on hi boot for a profitable journey oh that it follower have no more right nor nerve nor vigour in get their wife maidenhead than in it lesson this be not what socrates say who be it master and ours he value a he ought bodily pleasure but he prefer that of the mind a have more force constancy facility variety and dignity this accord to him go by no mean alone he be not so fantastic but only it go first temperance with him be the moderatrix not the adversary of pleasure nature be a gentle guide but not more sweet and gentle than prudent and just i hunt after her foot throughout we have confound it with artificial trace and that academic and peripatetic good which be to live accord to it become on this account hard to limit and explain and that of the stoic neighbour to it which be to consent to nature be it not an error to esteem any action less worthy because they be necessary and yet they will not take it out of my head that it be not a very convenient marriage of pleasure with necessity with which say an ancient the god always conspire to what end do we dismember by divorce a building unite by so close and brotherly a correspondence let u on the contrary confirm it by mutual office let the mind rouse and quicken the heaviness of the body and the body stay and fix the levity of the soul in this present that god have make u there be nothing unworthy our care we stand accountable for it even to a hair and be it not a commission to man to conduct man accord to hi condition ti express plain and the very principal one and the creator have seriously and strictly prescribe it to u authority have power only to work in regard to matter of common judgment and be of more weight in a foreign language therefore let u again charge at it in this place to make this apparent ask any one some day to tell you what whimsy and imagination he put into hi pate upon the account of which he divert hi thought from a good meal and regret the time he spend in eat you will find there be nothing so insipid in all the dish at your table a this wise meditation of hi for the most part we have well sleep than wake to the purpose we wake and that hi discourse and notion be not worth the bad mess there though they be the ecstasy of archimedes himself what then i do not here speak of nor mix with the rabble of u ordinary men and the vanity of the thought and desire that divert u those venerable soul elevate by the ardour of devotion and religion to a constant and conscientious meditation of divine thing who by the energy of vivid and vehement hope prepossess the use of the eternal nourishment the final aim and last step of christian desire the sole constant and incorruptible pleasure disdain to apply themselves to our necessitous fluid and ambiguous convenience and easily resign to the body the care and use of sensual and temporal pasture ti a privilege study between ourselves i have ever observe supercelestial opinion and subterranean manner to be of singular accord aesop that great man saw hi master piss a he walk what then say he must we drop a we run let u manage our time there yet remain a great deal idle and ill employ the mind have not willingly other hour enough wherein to do it business without disassociate itself from the body in that little space it must have for it necessity they would put themselves out of themselves and escape from be men it be folly instead of transform themselves into angel they transform themselves into beast instead of elevate they lay themselves low these transcendental humour affright me like high and inaccessible place and nothing be hard for me to digest in the life of socrates but hi ecstasy and communication with demon nothing so human in plato a that for which they say he be call divine and of our science those seem to be the most terrestrial and low that be high mounted and i find nothing so humble and mortal in the life of alexander a hi fancy about hi immortalisation philotas pleasantly quip him in hi answer he congratulate him by letter concern the oracle of jupiter ammon which have place him amongst the god upon thy account i be glad of it but the men be to be pity who be to live with a man and to obey him who exceed and be not content with the measure of a man the pretty inscription wherewith the athenian honour the entry of pompey into their city be conformable to my sense by so much thou art a god a thou confessest thee a man ti an absolute and a it be a divine perfection for a man to know how loyally to enjoy hi be we seek other condition by reason we do not understand the use of our own and go out of ourselves because we know not how there to reside ti to much purpose to go upon stilt for when upon stilt we must yet walk with our leg and when seat upon the most elevated throne in the world we be but seat upon our breech the fair life in my opinion be those which regularly accommodate themselves to the common and human model without miracle without extravagance old age stand a little in need of a more gentle treatment let u recommend that to god the protector of health and wisdom but let it be gay and sociable
