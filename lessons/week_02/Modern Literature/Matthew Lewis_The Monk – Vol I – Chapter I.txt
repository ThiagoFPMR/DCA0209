confess that if an amiable cavalier be to present himself here she intend to throw a tender and significant look upon don christoval but a she unluckily happen to squint most abominably the glance fell directly upon hi companion lorenzo take the compliment to himself and answer it by a profound bow may i enquire say he the name of the marquis the marquis de la cisterna i know him intimately well he be not at present in madrid but be expect here daily he be one of the best of men and if the lovely antonia will permit me to be her advocate with him i doubt not my be able to make a favourable report of her cause antonia raise her blue eye and silently thank him for the offer by a smile of inexpressible sweetness leonellas satisfaction be much more loud and audible indeed a her

niece how often have i tell you that you never should interrupt a person who be speak when do you ever know me do such a thing are these your murcian manner mercy on me i shall never be able to make this girl any thing like a person of good breeding but pray segnor she continue address herself to don christoval inform me why such a crowd be assemble today in this cathedral can you possibly be ignorant that ambrosio abbot of this monastery pronounce a sermon in this church every thursday all madrid ring with hi praise a yet he have preach but thrice but all who have hear him be so delighted with hi eloquence that it be as difficult to obtain a placeat church a at the first representation of a new comedy hi fame certainly must have reach your ear ala segnor till yesterday i never have the good fortune to see madrid and at cordova we be so little informed of what be pass in the rest of the world that the name of ambrosio have never be mention in it precinct you will find it in every one mouth at madrid he seem to have fascinate the inhabitant and not have attend hi sermon myself i be astonish at the enthusiasm which he have excite the adoration pay him both by young and old by man and woman be unexampled the grandee load him with present their wife refuse to have any other confessor and he be know through all the city by the name of the man of holiness undoubtedly segnor he be of noble origin that point still remain undecided the late superior of the capuchin find him while yet an infant at the abbey door all attempt to discover who have leave him there be vain and the child himself could give no account of hi parent he be educate in the monastery where he have remain ever since he early show a strong inclination for study and retirement and as soon a he be of a proper age he pronounce hi vow no one have ever appear to claim him or clear up the mystery which conceal hi birth and the monk who find their account in the favour which be shew to their establishment from respect to him have not hesitate to publish that he be a present to them from the virgin in truth the singular austerity of hi life give some countenance to the report he be now thirty year old every hour of which period have be pass in study total seclusion from the world and mortification of the flesh till these last three week when he be choose superior of the society to which he belong he have never be on the outside of the abbey wall even now he never quit them except on thursday when he deliver a discourse in this cathedral which all madrid assembles to hear hi knowledge be say to be the most profound hi eloquence the most persuasive in the whole course of hi life he have never be know to transgress a single rule of hi order the small stain be not to be discover upon hi character and he be report to be so strict an observer of chastity that he know not in what consist the difference of man and woman the common people therefore esteem him to be a saint do that make a saint enquire antonia bless me then be i one holy st barbara exclaim leonella what a question fye child fye these be not fit subject for young woman to handle you should not seem to remember that there be such a thing a a man in the world and you ought to imagine every body to be of the same sex with yourself i should like to see you give people to understand that you know that a man have no breast and no hip and no luckily for antonias ignorance which her aunt lecture would soon have dispel an universal murmur through the church announce the preacher arrival donna leonella rise from her seat to take a good view of him and antonia follow her example he be a man of noble port and command presence hi stature be lofty and hi feature uncommonly handsome hi nose be aquiline hi eye large black and sparkling and hi dark brows almost join together hi complexion be of a deep but clear brown study and watch have entirely deprive hi cheek of colour tranquillity reign upon hi smooth unwrinkled forehead and content express upon every feature seem to announce the man equally unacquainted with care and crime he bow himself with humility to the audience still there be a certain severity in hi look and manner that inspire universal awe and few could sustain the glance of hi eye at once fiery and penetrate such be ambrosio abbot of the capuchin and surnamed the man of holiness antonia while she gaze upon him eagerly felt a pleasure fluttering in her bosom which till then have be unknown to her and for which she in vain endeavour to account she wait with impatience till the sermon should begin and when at length the friar speak the sound of hi voice seem to penetrate into her very soul though no other of the spectator felt such violent sensation a do the young antonia yet every one listen with interest and emotion they who be insensible to religions merit be still enchant with ambrosios oratory all find their attention irresistibly attract while he speak and the most profound silence reign through the crowd aisle even lorenzo could not resist the charm he forget that antonia be seat near him and listen to the preacher with undivided attention in language nervous clear and simple the monk expatiate on the beauty of religion he explain some abstruse part of the sacred writing in a style that carry with it universal conviction hi voice at once distinct and deep be fraught with all the terror of the tempest while he inveigh against the vice of humanity and describe the punishment reserve for them in a future state every hearer look back upon hi past offence and tremble the thunder seem to roll whose bolt be destine to crush him and the abyss of eternal destruction to open before hi foot but when ambrosio change hi theme spoke of the excellence of an unsullied conscience of the glorious prospect which eternity present to the soul untainted with reproach and of the recompense which await it in the region of everlasting glory hi auditor felt their scattered spirit insensibly return they throw themselves with confidence upon the mercy of their judge they hang with delight upon the consoling word of the preacher and while hi full voice swell into melody they be transport to those happy region which he paint to their imagination in colour so brilliant and glow the discourse be of considerable length yet when it conclude the audience grieve that it have not last longer though the monk have cease to speak enthusiastic silence still prevail through the church at length the charm gradually dissolve the general admiration be express in audible term a ambrosio descend from the pulpit hi auditor crowd round him load him with blessing throw themselves at hi foot and kiss the hem of hi garment he pass on slowly with hi hand cross devoutly upon hi bosom to the door open into the abbey chapel at which hi monk wait to receive him he ascend the step and then turn towards hi follower address to them a few word of gratitude and exhortation while he speak hi rosary compose of large grain of amber fell from hi hand and drop among the surround multitude it be seize eagerly and immediately divide amidst the spectator whoever become possessor of a bead preserve it a a sacred relique and have it be the chaplet of thriceblessed st francis himself it could not have be dispute with great vivacity the abbot smile at their eagerness pronounce hi benediction and quit the church while humility dwell upon every feature dwelt she also in hi heart antonias eye follow him with anxiety a the door close after him it seem to her a have she lose some one essential to her happiness a tear stole in silence down her cheek he be separate from the world say she to herself perhaps i shall never see him more a she wipe away the tear lorenzo observe her action are you satisfy with our orator say he or do you think that madrid overrate hi talent antonias heart be so filled with admiration for the monk that she eagerly seize the opportunity of speaking of him besides a she now no longer consider lorenzo a an absolute stranger she be less embarrassed by her excessive timidity oh he far exceed all my expectation answer she till this moment i have no idea of the power of eloquence but when he speak hi voice inspire me with such interest such esteem i might almost say such affection for him that i be myself astonish at the acuteness of my feeling lorenzo smile at the strength of her expression you be young and just enter into life say he your heart new to the world and full of warmth and sensibility receive it first impression with eagerness artless yourself you suspect not other of deceit and view the world through the medium of your own truth and innocence you fancy all who surround you to deserve your confidence and esteem what pity that these gay vision must soon be dissipate what pity that you must soon discover the baseness of mankind and guard against your fellowcreatures a against your foe ala segnor reply antonia the misfortune of my parent have already placebefore me but too many sad example of the perfidy of the world yet surely in the present instance the warmth of sympathy can not have deceive me in the present instance i allow that it have not ambrosios character be perfectly without reproach and a man who have pass the whole of hi life within the wall of a convent can not have find the opportunity to be guilty even be he possess of the inclination but now when oblige by the duty of hi situation he must enter occasionally into the world and be throw into the way of temptation it be now that it behove him to show the brilliance of hi virtue the trial be dangerous he be just at that period of life when the passion be most vigorous unbridled and despotic hi establish reputation will mark him out to seduction a an illustrious victim novelty will give additional charm to the allurement of pleasure and even the talent with which nature have endow him will contribute to hi ruin by facilitate the mean of obtain hi object very few would return victorious from a contest so severe ah surely ambrosio will be one of those few of that i have myself no doubt by all account he be an exception to mankind in general and envy would seek in vain for a blot upon hi character segnor you delight me by this assurance it encourage me to indulge my prepossession in hi favour and you know not with what pain i should have repress the sentiment ah dear aunt entreat my mother to choose him for our confessor i entreat her replied leonella i promise you that i shall do no such thing i do not like this same ambrosio in the least he have a look of severity about him that make me tremble from head to foot were he my confessor i should never have the courage to avow one half of my peccadillo and then i should be in a rare condition i never saw such a sternlooking mortal and hope that i never shall see such another hi description of the devil god bless u almost terrify me out of my wit and when he speak about sinner he seem a if he be ready to eat them you be right segnora answer don christoval too great severity be say to be ambrosios only fault exempt himself from human failing he be not sufficiently indulgent to those of other and though strictly just and disinterested in hi decision hi government of the monk have already show some proof of hi inflexibility but the crowd be nearly dissipate will you permit u to attend you home oh christ segnor exclaim leonella affect to blush i would not suffer such a thing for the universe if i come home attend by so gallant a cavalier my sister be so scrupulous that she would read me an hour lecture and i should never hear the last of it besides i rather wish you not to make your proposal just at present my proposal i assure you segnora oh segnor i believe that your assurance of impatience be all very true but really i must desire a little respite it would not be quite so delicate in me to accept your hand at first sight accept my hand a i hope to live and breathe oh dear segnor press me no further if you love me i shall consider your obedience a a proof of your affection you shall hear from me tomorrow and so farewell but pray cavalier may i not enquire your name my friend reply lorenzo be the conde dossorio and mine lorenzo de medina ti sufficient well don lorenzo i shall acquaint my sister with your oblige offer and let you know the result with all expedition where may i send to you i be always to be find at the medina palace you may depend upon hear from me farewell cavalier segnor conde let me entreat you to moderate the excessive ardour of your passion however to prove to you that i be not displease with you and prevent your abandon yourself to despair receive this mark of my affection and sometimes bestow a thought upon the absent leonella a she say this she extend a lean and wrinkle hand which her suppose admirer kiss with such sorry grace and constraint so evident that lorenzo with difficulty repress hi inclination to laugh leonella then hasten to quit the church the lovely antonia follow her in silence but when she reach the porch she turn involuntarily and cast back her eye towards lorenzo he bow to her a bidding her farewell she return the compliment and hastily withdraw so lorenzo say don christoval as soon a they be alone you have procure me an agreeable intrigue to favour your design upon antonia i obligingly make a few civil speech which mean nothing to the aunt and at the end of an hour i find myself upon the brink of matrimony how will you reward me for have suffer so grievously for your sake what can repay me for have kiss the leathern paw of that confound old witch diavolo she have leave such a scent upon my lip that i shall smell of garlick for this month to come a i pass along the prado i shall be take for a walking omelet or some large onion run to seed i confess my poor count reply lorenzo that your service have be attend with danger yet be i so far from suppose it be past all endurance that i shall probably solicit you to carry on your amour still far from that petition i conclude that the little antonia have make some impression upon you i can not express to you how much i be charmed with her since my father death my uncle the duke de medina have signify to me hi wish to see me married i have till now elude hi hint and refuse to understand them but what i have see this evening well what have you see this evening why surely don lorenzo you can not be mad enough to think of make a wife out of this granddaughter of as honest a painstaking shoemaker a any in cordova you forget that she be also the granddaughter of the late marquis de la cisterna but without dispute about birth and title i must assure you that i never behold a woman so interesting a antonia very possibly but you can not mean to marry her why not my dear conde i shall have wealth enough for both of u and you know that my uncle think liberally upon the subject from what i have see of raymond de la cisterna i be certain that he will readily acknowledge antonia for hi niece her birth therefore will be no objection to my offer her my hand i should be a villain could i think of her on any other term than marriage and in truth she seem possess of every quality requisite to make me happy in a wife young lovely gentle sensible sensible why she say nothing but yes and no she do not say much more i must confessbut then she always say yes or no in the right placedid she so oh your most obedient that be use a right lover argument and i dare dispute no longer with so profound a casuist suppose we adjourn to the comedy it be out of my power i only arrive last night at madrid and have not yet have an opportunity of see my sister you know that her convent be in this street and i be go thither when the crowd which i saw throng into this church excite my curiosity to know what be the matter i shall now pursue my first intention and probably pass the evening with my sister at the parlour grate your sister in a convent say you oh very true i have forget and how do donna agnes i be amazed don lorenzo how you could possibly think of immure so charm a girl within the wall of a cloister i think of it don christoval how can you suspect me of such barbarity you be conscious that she take the veil by her own desire and that particular circumstance make her wish for a seclusion from the world i use every mean in my power to induce her to change her resolution the endeavour be fruitless and i lose a sister the lucky fellow you i think lorenzo you be a considerable gainer by that loss if i remember right donna agnes have a portion of ten thousand pistol half of which revert to your lordship by st jago i wish that i have fifty sister in the same predicament i should consent to lose them every soul without much heartburning how conde say lorenzo in an angry voice do you suppose me base enough to have influence my sister retirement do you suppose that the despicable wish to make myself master of her fortune could admirable courage don lorenzo now the man be all in a blaze god grant that antonia may soften that fiery temper or we shall certainly cut each other throat before the month be over however to prevent such a tragical catastrophe for the present i shall make a retreat and leave you master of the field farewell my knight of mount aetna moderate that inflammable disposition and remember that whenever it be necessary to make love to yonder harridan you may reckon upon my service he say and dart out of the cathedral how wildbrained say lorenzo with so excellent an heart what pity that he possess so little solidity of judgment the night be now fast advance the lamp be not yet light the faint beam of the rise moon scarcely could pierce through the gothic obscurity of the church lorenzo find himself unable to quit the spot the void leave in hi bosom by antonias absence and hi sister sacrifice which don christoval have just recall to hi imagination create that melancholy of mind which accord but too well with the religious gloom surround him he be still lean against the seventh column from the pulpit a soft and cool air breathe along the solitary aisle the moonbeam dart into the church through paint window ting the fret roof and massy pillar with a thousand various tint of light and colour universal silence prevail around only interrupt by the occasional closing of door in the adjoining abbey the calm of the hour and solitude of the placecontribute to nourish lorenzos disposition to melancholy he throw himself upon a seat which stand near him and abandon himself to the delusion of hi fancy he think of hi union with antonia he think of the obstacle which might oppose hi wish and a thousand change vision float before hi fancy sad ti true but not unpleasing sleep insensibly steal over him and the tranquil solemnity of hi mind when awake for a while continue to influence hi slumber he still fancy himself to be in the church of the capuchin but it be no long dark and solitary multitude of silver lamp shed splendour from the vaulted roof accompanied by the captivate chaunt of distant chorister the organ melody swell through the church the altar seem decorate a for some distinguish feast it be surround by a brilliant company and near it stand antonia array in bridal white and blush with all the charm of virgin modesty half hop half fear lorenzo gaze upon the scene before him suddenly the door lead to the abbey unclosed and he saw attend by a long train of monk the preacher advance to whom he have just listen with so much admiration he draw near antonia and where be the bridegroom say the imaginary friar antonia seem to look round the church with anxiety involuntarily the youth advance a few step from hi concealment she saw him the blush of pleasure glow upon her cheek with a graceful motion of her hand she beckon to him to advance he disobey not the command he fly towards her and throw himself at her foot she retreat for a moment then gaze upon him with unutterable delightyes she exclaim my bridegroom my destine bridegroom she say and hasten to throw herself into hi arm but before he have time to receive her an unknown rushed between them hi form be gigantic hi complexion be swarthy hi eye fierce and terrible hi mouth breathe out volume of fire and on hi forehead be write in legible characterspride lust inhumanity antonia shriek the monster clasp her in hi arm and spring with her upon the altar torture her with hi odious caress she endeavour in vain to escape from hi embrace lorenzo fly to her succour but ere he have time to reach her a loud burst of thunder be hear instantly the cathedral seem crumble into piece the monk betook themselves to flight shriek fearfully the lamp be extinguish the altar sink down and in it placeappear an abyss vomit forth cloud of flame utter a loud and terrible cry the monster plunge into the gulph and in hi fall attempt to drag antonia with him he strive in vain animate by supernatural power she disengage herself from hi embrace but her white robe be leave in hi possession instantly a wing of brilliant splendour spread itself from either of antonias arm she dart upwards and while ascend cry to lorenzo friend we shall meet above at the same moment the roof of the cathedral open harmonious voice peal along the vault and the glory into which antonia be receive be compose of ray of such dazzling brightness that lorenzo be unable to sustain the gaze hi sight fail and he sink upon the ground when he wake he find himself extend upon the pavement of the church it be illuminate and the chaunt of hymn sound from a distance for a while lorenzo could not persuade himself that what he have just witness have be a dream so strong an impression have it make upon hi fancy a little recollection convince him of it fallacy the lamp have be light during hi sleep and the music which he hear be occasion by the monk who be celebrate their vesper in the abbey chapel lorenzo rise and prepare to bend hi step towards hi sister convent hi mind fully occupy by the singularity of hi dream he already draw near the porch when hi attention be attract by perceive a shadow move upon the opposite wall he look curiously round and soon descry a man wrap up in hi cloak who seem carefully examine whether hi action be observe very few people be exempt from the influence of curiosity the unknown seem anxious to conceal hi business in the cathedral and it be this very circumstance which make lorenzo wish to discover what he be about our hero be conscious that he have no right to pry into the secret of this unknown cavalier i will go say lorenzo and lorenzo stay where he be the shadow throw by the column effectually conceal him from the stranger who continue to advance with caution at length he draw a letter from beneath hi cloak and hastily placeit beneath a colossal statue of st francis then retire with precipitation he conceal himself in a part of the church at a considerable distance from that in which the image stand so say lorenzo to himself this be only some foolish love affair i believe i may as well be go for i can do no good in it in truth till that moment it never come into hi head that he could do any good in it but he think it necessary to make some little excuse to himself for have indulge hi curiosity he now make a second attempt to retire from the church for this time he gain the porch without meet with any impediment but it be destine that he should pay it another visit that night a he descend the step lead into the street a cavalier rush against him with such violence that both be nearly overturn by the concussion lorenzo put hi hand to hi sword how now segnor say he what mean you by this rudeness ha be it you medina reply the newcomer whom lorenzo by hi voice now recognize for don christoval you be the lucky fellow in the universe not to have leave the church before my return in in my dear lad they will be here immediately who will be here the old hen and all her pretty little chicken in i say and then you shall know the whole history lorenzo follow him into the cathedral and they conceal themselves behind the statue of st francis and now say our hero may i take the liberty of ask what be
