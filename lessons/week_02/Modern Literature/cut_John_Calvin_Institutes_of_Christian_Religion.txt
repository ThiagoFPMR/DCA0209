in the first edition of this work notexpect that success which the lord in hi infinite goodness hath give i handle the subject for the most part in a superficial manner a be usual in small treatise but when i understand that it have obtain from almost all pious person such a favourable acceptance a i never could have presume to wish much less to hope while i be conscious of receive far more attention than i have deserve i think it would evince great ingratitude if i do notendeavour at least accord to my humble ability to make some suitable return for the attention pay to meattentions of themselves calculate to stimulate my industry nor do i attempt this only in the second edition but in every succeed one the work have be improve by some further enlargement but though i repent notthe labour then devote to it yet i never satisfy myself till it be arrange in the order in which it be now publish and i trust i have here present to my reader what their judgment will unite in approving of my diligent application to the accomplishment of this service for the church of god i can produce abundant proof for last winter when i think that a quartan ague would speedily terminate in my death the more my disorder increase the less i spar myself till i have finish this book to leave it behind me a some grateful return to such kind solicitation of the religious public indeed i would rather it have be do sooner but it be soon enough if well enough i shall think it have appear at the proper time when i shall find it to have be more beneficial than before to the church of god this be my only wish i should indeed be ill requite for my labour if i do notcontent myself with the approbation of god alone despise equally the foolish and perverse judgment of ignorant men and the calumny and detraction of the wicked for though god hath wholly devote my mind to study the enlargement of hi kingdom and the promotion of general usefulness and i have the testimony of my own conscience of angel and of god himself that since i undertake the office of a teacher in the church i have have no other object in view than to profit the church by maintain the pure doctrine of godliness yet i suppose there be no man more slandered or calumniate than myself when this preface be actually in the press i have certain information that at augsburg where the state of the empire be assemble a report have be circulate of my defection to popery and receive with unbecoming eagerness in the court of the prince this be the gratitude of those who can notbe unacquainted with the numerous proof of my constancy which notonly refute such a foul calumny but with all equitable and humane judge ought to preserve me from it but the devil with all hi host be deceive if he think to overwhelm me with vile falsehood or to render me more timid indolent or dilatory by such indignity for i trust that god in hi infinite goodness will enable me to persevere with patient constancy in the career of hi holy call of which i afford my pious reader a fresh proof in this edition now my design in this work have be to prepare and qualify student of theology for the reading of the divine word that they may have an easy introduction to it and be enable to proceed in it without any obstruction for i think i have give such a comprehensive summary and orderly arrangement of all the branch of religion that with proper attention no person will find any difficulty in determine what ought to be the principal object of hi research in the scripture and to what end he ought to refer any thing it contain this way therefore be prepared if i should hereafter publish any exposition of the scripture i shall have no need to introduce long discussion respect doctrine or digression on common topic and therefore shall always compress them within a narrow compass this will relieve the pious reader from great trouble and tediousness provide he come previously furnish with the necessary information by a knowledge of the present work but a the reason of this design be very evident in my numerous commentary i would rather have it know from the fact itself than from my declaration farewell friendly reader and if you receive any benefit from my labour let me have the assistance of your prayer with god our father geneva st august dedication to hi most christian majesty francis king of the french and hi sovereign john calvin wisheth peace and salvation in christ when i begin this work sire nothing be far from my thought than write a book which would afterwards be present to your majesty my intention be only to lay down some elementary principle by which inquirer on the subject of religion might be instruct in the nature of true piety and this labour i undertake chiefly for my countryman the french of whom i apprehend multitude to be hunger and thirst after christ but saw very few possess any real knowledge of him that this be my design the book itself prove by it simple method and unadorned composition but when i perceive that the fury of certain wicked men in your kingdom have grow to such a height a to leave no room in the land for sound doctrine i think i should be usefully employ if in the same work i deliver my instruction to them and exhibit my confession to you that you may know the nature of that doctrine which be the object of such unbounded rage to those madman who be now disturb the country with fire and sword for i shall notbe afraid to acknowledge that this treatise contain a summary of that very doctrine which accord to their clamour deserve to be punish with imprisonment banishment proscription and flame and to be exterminate from the face of the earth i well know with what atrocious insinuation your ear have be fill by them in order to render our cause most odious in your esteem but your clemency should lead you to consider that if accusation be account a sufficient evidence of guilt there will be an end of all innocence in word and action if any one indeed with a view to bring an odium upon the doctrine which i be endeavour to defend should allege that it have long ago be condemn by the general consent and suppress by many judicial decision this will be only equivalent to say that it have be sometimes violently reject through the influence and power of it adversary and sometimes insidiously and fraudulently oppress by falsehood artifice and calumny violence be display when sanguinary sentence be pass against it without the cause be hear and fraud when it be unjustly accuse of sedition and mischief lest any one should suppose that these our complaint be unfounded you yourself sire can bear witness of the false calumny with which you hear it daily traduce that it only tendency be to wrest the sceptre of king out of their hand to overturn all the tribunal and judicial proceeding to subvert all order and government to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the people to abrogate all law to scatter all property and possession and in a word to involve every thing in total confusion and yet you hear the small portion of what be allege against it for such horrible thing be circulate amongst the vulgar that if they be true the whole world would justly pronounce it and it abettor worthy of a thousand fire and gibbet who then will wonder at it become the object of public odium where credit be give to such most iniquitous accusation this be the cause of the general consent and conspiracy to condemn u and our doctrine hurried away with this impulse those who sit in judgment pronounce for sentence the prejudice they bring from home with them and think their duty fully discharge if they condemn none to be punish but such a be convict by their own confession or by sufficient proof convicted of what crime of this condemn doctrine they say but with what justice be it condemn now the ground of defence be notto abjure the doctrine itself but to maintain it truth on this subject however nota word be allow to be uttered wherefore i beseech you sireand surely it be notan unreasonable requestto take upon yourself the entire cognizance of this cause which have hitherto be confusedly and carelessly agitate without any order of law and with outrageous passion rather than judicial gravity think notthat i be now meditate my own individual defence in order to effect a safe return to my native country for though i feel the affection which every man ought to feel for it yet under the exist circumstance i regret notmy removal from it but i plead the cause of all the godly and consequently of christ himself which have be in these time persecute and trample on in all way in your kingdom now lie in a most deplorable state and this indeed rather through the tyranny of certain pharisee than with your knowledge how this come to pass be foreign to my present purpose to say but it certainly lie in a most afflicted state for the ungodly have go to such length that the truth of christ if notvanquish dissipate and entirely destroy be bury a it be in ignoble obscurity while the poor despise church be either destroy by cruel massacre or drive away into banishment or menace and terrify into total silence and still they continue their wonted madness and ferocity push violently against the wall already bent and finish the ruin they have begin in the mean time no one come forward to plead the cause against such fury if there be any person desirous of appear most favourable to the truth they only venture an opinion that forgiveness should be extend to the error and imprudence of ignorant people for this be the language of these moderate men call that error and imprudence which they know to be the certain truth of god and those ignorant people whose understand they perceive notto have be so despicable to christ but that he have favour them with the mystery of hi heavenly wisdom thus all be ashamed of the gospel but it shall be yours sire notto turn away your ear or thought from so just a defence especially in a cause of such importance a the maintenance of god glory unimpaired in the world the preservation of the honour of divine truth and the continuance of the kingdom of christ uninjured among u this be a cause worthy of your attention worthy of your cognizance worthy of your throne this consideration constitute true royalty to acknowledge yourself in the government of your kingdom to be the minister of god for where the glory of god be notmake the end of the government it be nota legitimate sovereignty but a usurpation and he be deceive who expect last prosperity in that kingdom which be notrule by the sceptre of god that be hi holy word for that heavenly oracle can notfail which declare that where there be no vision the people perish nor should you be seduce from this pursuit by a contempt of our meanness we be fully conscious to ourselves how very mean and abject we be be miserable sinner before god and account most despicable by men be if you please the refuse of the world deserving of the vile appellation that can be find so that nothing remain for u to glory in before god but hi mercy alone by which without any merit of ours we have be admit to the hope of eternal salvation and before men nothing but our weakness the slight confession of which be esteem by them a the great disgrace but our doctrine must stand exalt above all the glory and invincible by all the power of the world because it be notours but the doctrine of the living god and of hi christ whom the father hath constitute king that he may have dominion from sea to sea and from the river even to the end of the earth and that he may rule in such a manner that the whole earth with it strength of iron and with it splendour of gold and silver smite by the rod of hi mouth may be break to piece like a potter vessel for thus do the prophet foretell the magnificence of hi kingdom our adversary reply that our plead the word of god be a false pretence and that we be nefarious corrupt of it but that this be notonly a malicious calumny but egregious impudence by read our confession you will in your wisdom be able to judge yet something far be necessary to be say to excite your attention or at least to prepare your mind for this perusal paul direction that every prophecy be frame accord to the analogy of faith have fix an invariable standard by which all interpretation of scripture ought to be try if our principle be examine by this rule of faith the victory be ours for what be more consistent with faith than to acknowledge ourselves naked of all virtue that we may be clothe by god empty of all good that we may be fill by him slave to sin that we may be liberate by him blind that we may be enlighten by him lame that we may be guide weak that we may be support by him to divest ourselves of all ground of glory that he alone may be eminently glorious and that we may glory in him when we advance these and similar sentiment they interrupt u with complaint that this be the way to overturn i know notwhat blind light of nature pretend preparation free will and work meritorious of eternal salvation together with all their supererogation because they can notbear that the praise and glory of all goodness strength righteousness and wisdom should remain entirely with god but we read of none be reprove for have draw too freely from the fountain of live water on the contrary they be severely upbraided who have hew them out cistern broken cistern that can hold no water again what be more consistent with faith than to assure ourselves of god be a propitious father where christ be acknowledge a a brother and mediator than securely to expect all prosperity and happiness from him whose unspeakable love towards u go so far that he spar nothi own son but deliver him up for u than to rest in the certain expectation of salvation and eternal life when we reflect upon the father gift of christ in whom such treasure be hide here they oppose u and complain that this certainty of confidence be chargeable with arrogance and presumption but a we ought to presume nothing of ourselves so we should presume every thing of god nor be we divest of vain glory for any other reason than that we may learn to glory in the lord what shall i say more review sire all the part of our cause and consider u bad than the most abandon of mankind unless you clearly discover that we thus both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god because we believe that this be life eternal to know the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent for this hope some of u be bind in chain other be lash with scourge other be carry about a laughingstock other be outlaw other be cruelly tortured other escape by flight but we be all reduce to extreme perplexity execrate with dreadful curse cruelly slander and treat with the great indignity now look at our adversary i speak of the order of priest at whose will and direction other carry on these hostility against u and consider a little with me by what principle they be actuate the true religion which be teach in the scripture and ought to be universally maintain they readily permit both themselves and other to be ignorant of and to treat with neglect and contempt they think it unimportant what any one hold or deny concern god and christ provide he submit hi mind with an implicit faith a they call it to the judgment of the church nor be they much affect if the glory of god happen to be violate with open blasphemy provide no one lift a finger against the primacy of the apostolic see and the authority of their holy mother church why therefore do they contend with such extreme bitterness and cruelty for the mass purgatory pilgrimage and similar trifle and deny that any piety can be maintain without a most explicit faith so to speak in these thing whereas they prove none of them from the word of god why but because their belly be their god their kitchen be their religion deprive of which they consider themselves no longer a christian or even a men for though some feast themselves in splendour and other subsist on slender fare yet all live on the same pot which without this fuel would notonly cool but completely freeze every one of them therefore who be most solicitous for hi belly be find to be a most strenuous champion for their faith indeed they universally exert themselves for the preservation of their kingdom and the repletion of their belly but notone of them discover the least indication of sincere zeal nor do their attack on our doctrine cease here they urge every topic of accusation and abuse to render it an object of hatred or suspicion they call it novel and of recent originthey cavil at it a doubtful and uncertainthey inquire by what miracle it be confirmedthey ask whether it be right for it to be receive contrary to the consent of so many holy father and the custom of the high antiquitythey urge u to confess that it be schismatical in stir up opposition against the church or that the church be wholly extinct for many age during which no such thing be knownlastly they say all argument be unnecessary for that it nature may be determine by it fruit since it have produce such a multitude of sect so many factious tumult and such great licentiousness of vice it be indeed very easy for them to insult a deserted cause with the credulous and ignorant multitude but if we have also the liberty of speaking in our turn this acrimony which they now discover in violently foam against u with equal licentiousness and impunity would presently cool in the first place their call it novel be highly injurious to god whose holy word deserve notto be accuse of novelty i have no doubt of it be new to them to whom jesus christ and the gospel be equally new but those who know the antiquity of this preaching of paul that jesus christ die for our sin and rise again for our justification will find no novelty among u that it have long be conceal bury and unknown be the crime of human impiety now that the goodness of god have restore it to u it ought at least to be allow it just claim of antiquity from the same source of ignorance spring the notion of it be doubtful and uncertain this be the very thing which the lord complains of by hi prophet that the ox knoweth hi owner and the as hi master crib but that hi people know nothim but however they may laugh at it uncertainty if they be call to seal their own doctrine with their blood and live it would appear how much they value it very different be our confidence which dread neither the terror of death nor even the tribunal of god their require miracle of u be altogether unreasonable for we forge no new gospel but retain the very same whose truth be confirm by all the miracle ever work by christ and the apostle but they have this peculiar advantage above u that they can confirm their faith by continual miracle even to this day but the truth be they allege miracle which be calculate to unsettle a mind otherwise well establish they be so frivolous and ridiculous or vain and false nor if they be ever so preternatural ought they to have any weight in opposition to the truth of god since the name of god ought to be sanctify in all place and at all time whether by miraculous event or by the common order of nature this fallacy might perhaps be more specious if the scripture do notapprize u of the legitimate end and use of miracle for mark informs u that the miracle which follow the preaching of the apostle be work in confirmation of it and luke tell u that the lord give testimony to the word of hi grace when sign and wonder be do by the hand of the apostle very similar to which be the assertion of the apostle that salvation be confirm by the preaching of the gospel god also bear witness with sign and wonder and diver miracle but those thing which we be tell be seal of the gospel shall we pervert to undermine the faith of the gospel those thing which be design to be testimonial of the truth shall we accommodate to the confirmation of falsehood it be right therefore that the doctrine which accord to the evangelist claim the first attention be examine and try in the first place and if it be approve then it ought to derive confirmation from miracle but it be the characteristic of sound doctrine give by christ that it tend to promote notthe glory of men but the glory of god christ have lay down this proof of a doctrine it be wrong to esteem those a miracle which be direct to any other end than the glorification of the name of god alone and we should remember that satan have hi wonder which though they be juggle trick rather than real miracle be such a to delude the ignorant and inexperienced magician and enchanter have always be famous for miracle idolatry have be support by astonish miracle and yet we admit them nota proof of the superstition of magician or idolater with this engine also the simplicity of the vulgar be anciently assail by the donatist who abound in miracle we therefore give the same answer now to our adversary a augustine give to the donatist that our lord hath caution u against these miraclemongers by hi prediction that there should arise false prophet who by various sign and lie wonder should deceive if possible the very elect and paul have tell u that the kingdom of antichrist would be with all power and sign and lie wonder but these miracle they say be wrought notby idol or sorcerer or false prophet but by saint a if we be ignorant that it be a stratagem of satan to transform himself into an angel of light at the tomb of jeremiah who be bury in egypt the egyptian formerly offer sacrifice and other divine honour wa notthis abuse god holy prophet to the purpose of idolatry yet they suppose this veneration of hi sepulchre to be reward with a cure for the bite of serpent what shall we say but that it have be and ever will be the most righteous vengeance of god to send those who receive notthe love of the truth strong delusion that they should believe a lie we be by no mean without miracle and such a be certain and notliable to cavil but those under which they shelter themselves be mere illusion of satan seduce the people from the true worship of god to vanity another calumny be their charge u with opposition to the fathersi mean the writer of the early and purer agesas if those writer be abettor of their impiety whereas if the contest be to be terminate by this authority the victory in most part of the controversyto speak in the most modest termswould be on our side but though the writing of those father contain many wise and excellent thing yet in some respect they have suffer the common fate of mankind these very dutiful child reverence only their error and mistake but their excellence they either overlook or conceal or corrupt so that it may be truly say to be their only study to collect dross from the midst of gold then they overwhelm u with senseless clamour a despisers and enemy of the father but we do nothold them in such contempt but that if it be consistent with my present design i could easily support by their suffrage most of the sentiment that we now maintain but while we make use of their writing we always remember that all thing be ours to serve u notto have dominion over u and that we be christ alone and owe him universal obedience he who neglect this distinction will have nothing decide in religion since those holy men be ignorant of many thing frequently at variance with each other and sometimes even inconsistent with themselves there be great reason they say for the admonition of solomon notto transgress or remove the ancient landmarks which our father have set but the same rule be notapplicable to the bounding of field and to the obedience of faith which ought to be ready to forget her own people and her father house but if they be so fond of allegorize why do they notexplain the apostle rather than any other to be those father whose appoint landmark it be so unlawful to remove for this be the interpretation of jerome whose work they have receive into their canon but if they insist on preserve the landmark of those whom they understand to be intend why do they at pleasure so freely transgress them themselves there be two father of whom one say that our god neither eats nor drink and therefore need neither cup nor dish the other that sacred thing require no gold and that gold be no recommendation of that which be notpurchase with gold this landmark therefore be transgress by those who in sacred thing be so much delight with gold silver ivory marble jewel and silk and suppose that god be notrightly worship unless all thing abound in exquisite splendour or rather extravagant profusion there be a father who say he freely partook of flesh on a day when other abstain from it because he be a christian they transgress the landmark therefore when they curse the soul that taste flesh in lent there be two father of whom one say that a monk who labour notwith hi hand be on a level with a cheat or a robber and the other that it be unlawful for monk to live on what be nottheir own notwithstanding their assiduity in contemplation study and prayer and they have transgress this landmark by place the idle and distended carcass of monk in cell and brothel to be pamper on the substance of other there be a father who say that to see a painted image of christ or of any saint in the temple of christian be a dreadful abomination nor be this merely the sentence of an individual it be also decree by an ecclesiastical council that the object of worship should notbe paint on the wall they be far from confine themselves within these landmark for every corner be fill with image another father have advise that after have discharge the office of humanity towards the dead by the rite of sepulture we should leave them to their repose they break through these landmark by inculcate a constant solicitude for the dead there be one of the father who assert that the substance of bread and wine in the eucharist cease notbut remain just a the substance of the human nature remain in the lord christ unite with the divine they transgress this landmark therefore by pretend that on the word of the lord be recite the substance of bread and wine cease and be transubstantiate into hi body and blood there be father who while they exhibit to the universal church only one eucharist and forbid all scandalous and immoral person to approach it at the same time severely censure all who when present do notpartake of it how far have they remove these landmark when they fill notonly the church but even private house with their mass admit all who choose to be spectator of them and every one the more readily in proportion to the magnitude of hi contribution however chargeable with impurity and wickedness they invite none to faith in christ and a faithful participation of the sacrament but rather for purpose of gain bring forward their own work instead of the grace and merit of christ there be two father of whom one contend that the use of christ sacred supper should be wholly forbidden to those who content with partaking of one kind abstain from the other the other strenuously maintain that christian people ought notto be refuse the blood of their lord for the confession of whom they be require to shed their own these landmark also they have remove in appoint by an inviolable law that very thing which the former punish with excommunication and the latter give a powerful reason for disapprove there be a father who assert the temerity of decide on either side of an obscure subject without clear and evident testimony of scripture this landmark they forget when they make so many constitution canon and judicial determination without any authority from the word of god there be a father who upbraid montanus with have among other heresy be the first imposer of law for the observance of fast they have go far beyond this landmark also in establish fast by the strict law there be a father who deny that marriage ought to be forbid to the minister of the church and pronounce cohabitation with a wife to be real chastity and there be father who assent to hi judgment they have transgress these landmark by enjoin on their priest the strict celibacy there be a father who think that attention should be pay to christ only of whom it be say hear ye him and that no regard should be have to what other before u have either say or do only to what have be command by christ who be preminent over all this landmark they neither prescribe to themselves nor permit to be observe by other when they set up over themselves and other any master rather than christ there be a father who contend that the church ought notto take the precedence of christ because hi judgment be always accord to truth but ecclesiastical judge like other men may generally be deceive breaking down this landmark also they scruple notto assert that all the authority of the scripture depend on the decision of the church all the father with one heart and voice have declare it execrable and detestable for the holy word of god to be contaminate with the subtlety of sophist and perplex by the wrangle of logician do they confine themselves within these landmark when the whole business of their life be to involve the simplicity of the scripture in endless controversy and bad than sophistical wrangle so that if the father be now restore to life and heard this art of wrangle which they call speculative divinity they would notsuspect the dispute to have the least reference to god but if i would enumerate all the instance in which the authority of the father be insolently reject by those who would be think their dutiful child my address would exceed all reasonable bound month and year would be insufficient for me and yet such be their consummate and incorrigible impudence they dare to censure u for presume to transgress the ancient landmark nor can they gain any advantage against u by their argument from custom for if we be compel to submit to custom we should have to complain of the great injustice indeed if the judgment of men be correct custom should be seek among the good but the fact be often very different what appear to be practise by many soon obtain the force of a custom and human affair have scarcely ever be in so good a state a for the majority to be please with thing of real excellence from the private vice of multitude therefore have arise public error or rather a common agreement of vice which these good men would now have to be receive a law it be evident to all who can see that the world be inundate with more than an ocean of evil that it be overrun with numerous destructive pest that every thing be fast verge to ruin so that we must altogether despair of human affair or vigorously and even violently oppose such immense evil and the remedy be reject for no other reason but because we have be accustom to the evil so long but let public error be tolerate in human society in the kingdom of god nothing but hi eternal truth should be hear and regard which no succession of year no custom no confederacy can circumscribe thus isaiah once teach the chosen people of god say ye nota confederacy to all to whom this people shall say a confederacy that be that they should notunite in the wicked consent of the people nor fear their fear nor be afraid but rather sanctify the lord of host that he might be their fear and their dreadnow therefore let them if they please object against u past age and present example if we sanctify the lord of host we shall notbe much afraid for whether many age agree in similar impiety he be mighty to take vengeance on the third and fourth generation or whether the whole world combine in the same iniquity he have give an example of the fatal end of those who sin with a multitude by destroy all men with a deluge and preserve noah and hi small family in order that hi individual faith might condemn the whole world lastly a corrupt custom be nothing but an epidemical pestilence which be equally fatal to it object though they fall with a multitude besides they ought to consider a remark somewhere make by cyprian that person who sin through ignorance though they can notbe wholly exculpate may yet be consider in some degree excusable but those who obstinately reject the truth offer by the divine goodness be without any excuse at all nor be we so embarrass by their dilemma a to be oblige to confess either that the church be for some time extinct or that we have now a controversy with the church the church of christ have live and will continue to live as long a christ shall reign at the right hand of the father by whose hand she be sustain by whose protection she be defend by whose power she be preserve in safety for he will undoubtedly perform what he once promise to be with hi people even to the end of the world we have no quarrel against the church for with one consent we unite with all the company of the faithful in worship and adore the one god and christ the lord a he have be adore by all the pious in all age but our opponent deviate widely from the truth when they acknowledge no church but what be visible to the corporeal eye and endeavour to circumscribe it by those limit within which it be far from be include our controversy turn on the two follow pointsfirst they contend that the form of the church be always apparent and visible secondly they place that form in the see of the roman church and her order of prelate we assert on the contrary first that the church may exist without any visible form secondly that it form be notcontain in that external splendour which they foolishly admire but be distinguish by a very different criterion viz the pure preaching of god word and the legitimate administration of the sacrament they be notsatisfied unless the church can always be point out with the finger but how often among the jewish people be it so disorganize a to have no visible form leave what splendid form do we suppose could be see when elia deplore hi be leave alone how long after the come of christ do it remain without any external form how often since that time have war sedition and heresy oppress and totally obscure it if they have live at that period would they have believe that any church exist yet elia be inform that there be leave seven thousand who have notbow the knee to baal nor should we entertain any doubt of christ have always reign on earth ever since hi ascension to heaven but if the pious at such period have seek for any form evident to their sens must nottheir heart have be quite discourage indeed it be already consider by hilary in hi day a a grievous error that people be absorb in foolish admiration of the episcopal dignity and do notperceive the dreadful mischief conceal under that disguise for this be hi language one thing i advise youbeware of antichrist for you have an improper attachment to wall your veneration for the church of god be misplace on house and building you wrongly introduce under them the name of peace is there any doubt that they will be seat of antichrist i think mountain wood and lake prison and whirlpool less dangerous for these be the scene of retirement or banishment in which the prophet prophesy but what excite the veneration of the multitude in the present day for their horned bishop but the supposition that those be the holy prelate of religion whom they see preside over great city away then with such stupid admiration let u rather leave it to the lord since he alone knoweth them that be hi sometimes to remove from human observation all external knowledge of hi church i admit this to be a dreadful judgment of god on the earth but if it be deserve by the impiety of men why do we attempt to resist the righteous vengeance of god thus the lord punish the ingratitude of men in former age for in consequence of their resistance to hi truth and extinction of the light he have give them he permit them to be blind by sense delude by absurd falsehood and immerged in profound darkness so that there be no appearance of the true church leave yet at the same time in the midst of darkness and error he preserve hi scattered and concealed people from total destruction nor be this to be wonder at for he know how to save in all the confusion of babylon and the flame of the fiery furnace but how dangerous it be to estimate the form of the church by i know notwhat vain pomp which they contend for i shall rather briefly suggest than state at large l i should protract this discourse to an excessive length the pope they say who hold the apostolic see and the bishop anoint and consecrate by him provide they be equip with mitre and crosier represent the church and ought to be consider a the church therefore they can noterr how be thisbecause they be pastor of the church and consecrate to the lord and do notthe pastoral character belong to aaron and the other ruler of israel yet aaron and hi son after their designation to the priesthood fell into error when they make the golden calf accord to this mode of reason why should notthe four hundred prophet who lie to ahab have represent the church but the church remain on the side of micaiah solitary and despise a he be and out of hi mouth proceed the truth did notthose prophet exhibit both the name and appearance of the church who with united violence rise up against jeremiah and threaten and boast the law shall notperish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet jeremiah be sent singly against the whole multitude of prophet with a denunciation from the lord that the law shall perish from the priest counsel from the wise and the word from the prophet and be there notthe like external respectability in the council convene by the chief priest scribe and pharisee to consult about put christ to death now let them go and adhere to the external appearance and thereby make christ and all the prophet schismatics and on the other hand make the minister of satan instrument of the holy spirit but if they speak their real sentiment let them answer me sincerely what nation or place they consider a the seat of the church from the time when by a decree of the council of basil eugenius be depose and degrade from the pontificate and amadeus substitute in hi place they can notdeny that the council as far a relates to external form be a lawful one and summon notonly by one pope but by two there eugenius be pronounce guilty of schism rebellion and obstinacy together with all the host of cardinal and bishop who have join him in attempt a dissolution of the council yet afterwards assist by the favour of prince he regain the quiet possession of hi former dignity that election of amadeus though formally make by the authority of a general and holy synod vanish into smoke and he be appease with a cardinal hat like a barking dog with a morsel from the bosom of those heretic and rebel have proceed all the pope cardinal bishops abbot and priest ever since here they must stop for to which party will they give the title of the church will they deny that this be a general council which want nothing to complete it external majesty be solemnly convene by two papal bull consecrate by a preside legate of the roman see and well regulate in every point of order and invariably preserve the same dignity to the last will they acknowledge eugenius to be a schismatic with all hi adherent by whom they have all be consecrate either therefore let them give a different definition of the form of the church or whatever be their number we shall account them all schismatics a have be knowingly and voluntarily ordain by heretic but if it have never be ascertain before that the church be notconfine to external pomp they would themselves afford u abundant proof of it who have so long superciliously exhibit themselves to the world under the title of the church though they be at the same time the deadly plague of it i speak notof their moral and those tragical exploit with which all their life abound since they profess themselves to be pharisee who be to be hear and notimitate i refer to the very doctrine itself on which they find their claim to be consider a the church if you devote a portion of your leisure sire to the perusal of our writing you will clearly discover that doctrine to be a fatal pestilence of soul the firebrand ruin and destruction of the church finally they betray great want of candour by invidiously repeat what great commotion tumult and contention have attend the preaching of our doctrine and what effect it produce in many person for it be unfair to charge it with those evil which ought to be attribute to the malice of satan it be the native property of the divine word never to make it appearance without disturb satan and rouse hi opposition this be the most certain and unequivocal criterion by which it be distinguish from false doctrine which be easily broach when they be hear with general attention and receive with applause by the world thus in some age when all thing be immerged in profound darkness the prince of this world amuse and divert himself with the generality of mankind and like another sardanapalus give himself up to hi ease and pleasure in perfect peace for what would he do but amuse and divert himself in the quiet and undisturbed possession of hi kingdom but when the light shin from above dissipate a portion of hi darknesswhen that mighty one alarm and assault hi kingdomthen he begin to shake off hi wonted torpor and to hurry on hi armour first indeed he stir up the power of men to suppress the truth by violence at it first appearance and when this prove ineffectual he have recourse to subtlety he make the catabaptists and other infamous character the instrument of excite dissension and doctrinal controversy with a view to obscure and finally to extinguish it and now he continue to attack it in both way for he endeavour to root up this genuine seed by mean of human force and at the same time try every effort to choke it with hi tare that it may notgrow and produce fruit but all hi attempt will be vain if we attend to the admonition of the lord who hath long ago make u acquaint with hi device that we might notbe catch by him unawares and have arm u with sufficient mean of defence against all hi assault but to charge the word of god with the odium of sedition excite against it by wicked and rebellious men or of sect raise by impostorsis notthis extreme malignity yet it be notwithout example in former time elia be ask whether it be nothe that trouble israel christ be represent by the jew a guilty of sedition the apostle be accuse of stir up popular commotion wherein do this differ from the conduct of those who at the present day impute to u all the disturbance tumult and contention that break out against u but the proper answer to such accusation have be teach u by elia that the dissemination of error and the raising of tumult be notchargeable on u but on those who be resist the power of god but a this one reply be sufficient to repress their temerity so on the other hand we must meet the weakness of some person who be frequently disturb with such offence and become unsettled and waver in their mind now that they may notstumble and fall amidst this agitation and perplexity let them know that the apostle in their day experience the same thing that now befall u there be unlearned and unstable men peter say who wrest the inspired writing of paul to their own destruction there be despisers of god who when they hear that where sin abound grace do much more abound immediately conclude let u continue in sin that grace may abound when they hear that the faithful be notunder the law they immediately croak we will sin because we be notunder the law but under grace there be some who accuse him a an encourager of sin many false apostle creep in to destroy the church he have raise some preach the gospel of envy and strife notin sincerity maliciously suppose to add affliction to hi bond in some place the gospel be attend with little benefit all be seek their own notthe thing of jesus christ other return like dog to their vomit and like swine to their wallowing in the mire many pervert the liberty of the spirit into the licentiousness of the flesh many insinuate themselves a brother who afterwards bring the pious into danger various contention be excite among the brother themselves what be to be do by the apostle in such circumstance should they nothave dissemble for a time or rather have reject and desert that gospel which appear to be the nursery of so many dispute the cause of so many danger the occasion of so many offence but in such difficulty a these their mind be relieve by this reflection that christ be the stone of stumble and rock of offence set for the fall and rise again of many and for a sign which shall be speak against and arm with this confidence they proceed boldly through all the danger of tumult and offences the same consideration should support u since paul declare it to be the perpetual character of the gospel that it be a savour of death unto death in them that perish although it be rather give u to be the savour of life unto life and the power of god to the salvation of the faithful which we also should certainly experience it to be if we do notcorrupt this eminent gift of god by our ingratitude and pervert to our destruction what ought to be a principal instrument of our salvation but i return to you sire let notyour majesty be at all move by those groundless accusation with which our adversary endeavour to terrify you a that the sole tendency and design of this new gospelfor so they call itis to furnish a pretext for sedition and to gain impunity for all crime for god be notthe author of confusion but of peace nor be the son of god who come to destroy the work of the devil the minister of sin and it be unjust to charge u with such motif and design of which we have never give cause for the least suspicion be it probable that we be meditate the subversion of kingdomswe who be never hear to utter a factious word whose life be ever know to be peaceable and honest while we live under your government and who even now in our exile cease notto pray for all prosperity to attend yourself and your kingdom be it probable that we be seek an unlimited license to commit crime with impunity in whose conduct though many thing may be blame yet there be nothing worthy of such severe reproach nor have we by divine grace profit so little in the gospel but that our life may be an example to our detractor of chastity liberality mercy temperance patience modesty and every other virtue it be an undeniable fact that we sincerely fear and worship god whose name we desire to be sanctify both by our life and by our death and envy itself be constrain to bear testimony to the innocence and civil integrity of some of u who have suffer the punishment of death for that very thing which ought to be account their high praise but if the gospel be make a pretext for tumult which have notyet happen in your kingdom if any person make the liberty of divine grace an excuse for the licentiousness of their vice of whom i have know manythere be law and legal penalty by which they may be punish accord to their desert only let notthe gospel of god be reproach for the crime of wicked men you have now sire the virulent iniquity of our calumniators lay before you in a sufficient number of instance that you may notreceive their accusation with too credulous an eari fear i have go too much into the detail a this preface already approach the size of a full apology whereas i intend it notto contain our defence but only to prepare your mind to attend to the pleading of our cause for though you be now averse and alienate from u and even inflame against u we despair notof regain your favour if you will only once read with calmness and composure this our confession which we intend a our defence before your majesty but on the contrary if your ear be so preoccupied with the whisper of the malevolent a to leave no opportunity for the accuse to speak for themselves and if those outrageous fury with your connivance continue to persecute with imprisonment scourge torture confiscation and flame we shall indeed like sheep destine to the slaughter be reduce to the great extremity yet shall we in patience posse our soul and wait for the mighty hand of the lord which undoubtedly will in time appear and show itself arm for the deliverance of the poor from their affliction and for the punishment of their despisers who now exult in such perfect security may the lord the king of king establish your throne with righteousness and your kingdom with equity basil st august general syllabus the design of the author in these christian institute be twofold relate first to the knowledge of god a the way to attain a blessed immortality and in connection with and subservience to this secondly to the knowledge of ourselves in the prosecution of this design he strictly follow the method of the apostle creed a be most familiar to all christian for a the creed consist of four part the first relating to god the father the second to the son the third to the holy spirit the fourth to the church so the author distribute the whole of this work into four book correspond respectively to the four part of the creed a will clearly appear from the follow detail the first article of the creed relate to god the father and to the creation conservation and government of all thing which be include in hi omnipotence so the first book be on the knowledge of god consider a the creator preserver and governor of the universe at large and of every thing contain in it it show both the nature and tendency of the true knowledge of the creatorthat this be notlearn in the school but that every man from hi birth be selftaught ityet that the depravity of men be so great a to corrupt and extinguish this knowledge partly by ignorance partly by wickedness so that it neither lead him to glorify god a he ought nor conduct him to the attainment of happinessand though this internal knowledge be assist by all the creature around which serve a a mirror to display the divine perfection yet that man do notprofit by ittherefore that to those whom it be god will to bring to an intimate and save knowledge of himself he give hi write word which introduce observation on the sacred scripturethat he have therein reveal himself that notthe father only but the father son and holy spirit unite be the creator of heaven and earth whom neither the knowledge innate by nature nor the very beautiful mirror display to u in the world can in consequence of our depravity teach u to know so a to glorify him this give occasion for treating of the revelation of god in the scripture of the unity of the divine essence and the trinity of personsto prevent man from attribute to god the blame of hi own voluntary blindness the author show the state of man at hi creation and treat of the image of god freewill and the primitive integrity of naturehaving finish the subject of creation he proceed to the conservation and government of all thing conclude the first book with a full discussion of the doctrine of divine providence but since man be fall by sin from the state in which he be create it be necessary to come to christ therefore it follow in the creed and in jesus christ hi only son our lord c so in the second book of the institute our author treat of the knowledge of god a the redeemer in christ and have show the fall of man lead him to christ the mediator here he state the doctrine of original sinthat man possess no inherent strength to enable him to deliver himself from sin and the impending curse but that on the contrary nothing can proceed from him antecedently to reconciliation and renovation but what be deserve of condemnationtherefore that man be utterly lose in himself and incapable of conceive even a good thought by which he may restore himself or perform action acceptable to god he must seek redemption out of himself in christthat the law be give for this purpose notto confine it observer to itself but to conduct them to christ which give occasion to introduce an exposition of the moral lawthat he be know a the author of salvation to the jew under the law but more fully under the gospel in which he be manifest to the worldhence follow the doctrine of the similarity and difference of the old and new testament of the law and gospelit be next state that in order to the complete accomplishment of salvation it be necessary for the eternal son of god to become man and that he actually assume a real human natureit be also show how these two nature constitute one personthat the office of christ appoint for the acquisition and application of complete salvation by hi merit and efficacy be sacerdotal regal and propheticalnext follow the manner in which christ execute hi office or actually perform the part of a mediator be an exposition of the article respect hi death resurrection and ascension to heavenlastly the author show the truth and propriety of affirm that christ merit the grace of god and salvation for u as long a christ be separate from u he profit u nothing hence the necessity of our be ingraft into him a branch into a vine therefore the doctrine concern christ be follow in the third part of the creed by this clause i believe in the holy spirit a be the bond of union between u and christ so in the third book our author treat of the holy spirit who unite u to christand consequently of faith by which we embrace christ with hi twofold benefit free righteousness which he impute to u and regeneration which he commence within u by bestow repentance upon usand to show that we have notthe least room to glory in such faith a be unconnected with the pursuit of repentance before proceed to the full discussion of justification he treat at large of repentance and the continual exercise of it which christ apprehend by faith produce in u by hi spirithe next fully discuss the first and chief benefit of christ when unite to u by the holy spirit that be justificationand then treat of prayer which resemble the hand that actually receive those blessing to be enjoy which faith know from the word of promise to be lay up with god for our usebut a all men be notunited to christ the sole author of salvation by the holy spirit who create and preserve faith in u he treat of god eternal election which be the cause that we in whom he foresee no good but what he intend freely to bestow have be favour with the gift of christ and unite to god by the effectual call of the gospellastly he treat of complete regeneration and the fruition of happiness that be the final resurrection towards which our eye must be direct since in this world the felicity of the pious in respect of enjoyment be only begin but a the holy spirit do notunite all men to christ or make them partaker of faith and on those to whom he impart it he do notordinarily bestow it without mean but employ for this purpose the preaching of the gospel and the use of the sacrament with the administration of all discipline therefore it follow in the creed i believe in the holy catholic church whom though involve in eternal death yet in pursuance of the gratuitous election god have freely reconcile to himself in christ and make partaker of the holy spirit that be ingraft into christ they may have communion with him a their head whence flow a perpetual remission of sin and a full restoration to eternal life so in the fourth book our author treat of the churchthen of the mean use by the holy spirit in effectually call from spiritual death and preserve the churchthe word and sacramentsbaptism and the lord supperwhich be a it be christ regal sceptre by which he commence hi spiritual reign in the church by the energy of hi spirit and carry it forward from day to day during the present life after the close of which he perfect it without those mean and as political institution be the asylum of the church in this life though civil government be distinct from the spiritual kingdom of christ our author instruct u respect it a a signal blessing of god which the church ought to acknowledge with gratitude of heart till we be call out of this transitory state to the heavenly inheritance where god will be all in all this be the plan of the institute which may be comprise in the following brief summary man create originally upright be afterwards ruin notpartially but totally find salvation out of himself wholly in christ to whom be unite by the holy spirit freely bestow without any regard of future work he enjoy in him a twofold benefit the perfect imputation of righteousness which attend him to the grave and the commencement of sanctification which he daily increase till at length he complete it at the day of regeneration or resurrection of the body so that in eternal life and the heavenly inheritance hi praise be celebrate for such stupendous mercy book i on the knowledge of god the creator argument the first book treat of the knowledge of god the creator but this be chiefly manifest in the creation of man man also be make the subject of discussion thus the principal topic of the whole treatise be twothe knowledge of god and the knowledge of man in the first they be consider together in the following s separately yet some thing be introduce which may be refer to either or both what respect the scripture and image may belong to the knowledge of god what respect the formation of the world the holy angel and the devil to the knowledge of man and what respect the manner in which god govern the world to both on the first of these topic the knowledge of god this book show first what kind of knowledge god himself requireschap secondly where it must be soughtchap a follow notin man because though the human mind be naturally endue with it yet it be extinguish partly by ignorance partly by wickednesschap iv nor in the structure of the world because though it shin there with the bright evidence testimony of that kind however plain be through our stupidity wholly useless to uschap v but in the scripturechap thirdly what kind of a be god ischap fourthly the impiety of ascribe to god a visible form with observation on the adoration and origin of imageschap fifthly the reasonableness that god alone should be supremely worshippedchap lastly the unity of the divine essence and the distinction of three personschap on the other of these topic the knowledge of man it contain first a dissertation on the creation of the world and on the good and evil angel all which relate to manchap secondly proceed to man himself an examination of hi nature and powerschap but in order to a clear illustration of the knowledge of god and man the three remain s treat of the government of all human action and of the whole world in opposition to fortune and fate state the pure doctrine and show it use and conclude with prove that though god use the agency of the wicked he be pure from all pollution and chargeable with no blame the connection between the knowledge of god and the knowledge of ourselves true and substantial wisdom principally consist of two part the knowledge of god and the knowledge of ourselves but while these two branch of knowledge be so intimately connected which of them precedes and produce the other be noteasy to discover for in the first place no man can take a survey of himself but he must immediately turn to the contemplation of god in whom he live and move since it be evident that the talent which we possess be notfrom ourselves and that our very existence be nothing but a subsistence in god alone these bounty distil to u by drop from heaven form a it be so many stream conduct u to the fountainhead our poverty conduces to a clearer display of the infinite ful of god especially the miserable ruin into which we have be plunge by the defection of the first man compels u to raise our eye towards heaven notonly a hungry and famish to seek thence a supply for our want but arouse with fear to learn humility for since man be subject to a world of misery and have be spoil of hi divine array this melancholy exposure discover an immense mass of deformity every one therefore must be so impressed with a consciousness of hi own infelicity a to arrive at some knowledge of god thus a sense of our ignorance vanity poverty infirmity depravity and corruption lead u to perceive and acknowledge that in the lord alone be to be find true wisdom solid strength perfect goodness and unspotted righteousness and so by our imperfection we be excite to a consideration of the perfection of god nor can we really aspire toward him till we have begin to be displease with ourselves for who would notgladly rest satisfied with himself where be the man notactually absorb in selfcomplacency while he remain unacquainted with hi true situation or content with hi own endowment and ignorant or forgetful of hi own misery the knowledge of ourselves therefore be notonly an incitement to seek after god but likewise a considerable assistance towards find him on the other hand it be plain that no man can arrive at the true knowledge of himself without have first contemplate the divine character and then descend to the consideration of hi own for such be the native pride of u all we invariably esteem ourselves righteous innocent wise and holy till we be convince by clear proof of our unrighteousness turpitude folly and impurity but we be never thus convince while we confine our attention to ourselves and regard notthe lord who be the only standard by which this judgment ought to be form because from our natural proneness to hypocrisy any vain appearance of righteousness abundantly content u instead of the reality and every thing within and around u be exceedingly defile we be delight with what be least so a extremely pure while we confine our reflection within the limit of human corruption so the eye accustom to see nothing but black judge that to be very white which be but whitish or perhaps brown indeed the sens of our body may assist u in discover how grossly we err in estimate the power of the soul for if at noonday we look either on the ground or at any surround object we conclude our vision to be very strong and pierce but when we raise our eye and steadily look at the sun they be at once dazzle and confound with such a blaze of brightness and we be constrain to confess that our sight so piercing in view terrestrial thing when direct to the sun be dimness itself thus also it happen in the consideration of our spiritual endowment for as long a our view be bound by the earth perfectly content with our own righteousness wisdom and strength we fondly flatter ourselves and fancy we be little less than demigod but if we once elevate our thought to god and consider hi nature and the consummate perfection of hi righteousness wisdom and strength to which we ought to be conformedwhat before charmed u in ourselves under the false pretext of righteousness will soon be loathe a the great iniquity what strangely deceive u under the title of wisdom will be despise a extreme folly and what wear the appearance of strength will be prove to be most wretched impotence so very remote from the divine purity be what seem in u the high perfection hence that horror and amazement with which the scripture always represent the saint to have be impressed and disturb on every discovery of the presence of god for when we see those who before hi appearance stand secure and firm so astonished and affright at the manifestation of hi glory a to faint and almost expire through fearwe must infer that man be never sufficiently affect with a knowledge of hi own meanness till he have compare himself with the divine majesty of this consternation we have frequent example in the judge and prophet so that it be a common expression among the lord peoplewe shall die because we have see god therefore the history of job to humble men with a consciousness of their pollution impotence and folly derive it principal argument from a description of the divine purity power and wisdom and notwithout reason for we see how abraham the nearer he approach to behold the glory of the lord the more fully acknowledge himself to be but dust and ash and how elia could notbear hi approach without cover hi face hi appearance be so formidable and what can man do all vile and corrupt when fear constrain even the cherub themselves to veil their face this be what the prophet isaiah speak ofthe moon shall be confound and the sun ashamed when the lord of host shall reign that be when he shall make a fuller and near exhibition of hi splendour it shall eclipse the splendour of the bright object besides but though the knowledge of god and the knowledge of ourselves be intimately connect the proper order of instruction require u first to treat of the former and then to proceed to the discussion of the latter the nature and tendency of the knowledge of god by the knowledge of god i intend notmerely a notion that there be such a being but also an acquaintance with whatever we ought to know concern him conduce to hi glory and our benefit for we can notwith propriety say there be any knowledge of god where there be no religion or piety i have no reference here to that specie of knowledge by which men lose and condemn in themselves apprehend god the redeemer in christ the mediator but only to that first and simple knowledge to which the genuine order of nature would lead u if adam have retain hi innocence for though in the present ruined state of human nature no man will ever perceive god to be a father or the author of salvation or in any respect propitious but a pacify by the mediation of christ yet it be one thing to understand that god our maker support u by hi power governs u by hi providence nourishes u by hi goodness and follow u with blessing of every kind and another to embrace the grace of reconciliation propose to u in christ therefore since god be first manifest both in the structure of the world and in the general tenor of scripture simply a the creator and afterwards reveals himself in the person of christ a a redeemer hence arise a twofold knowledge of him of which the former be first to be consider and the other will follow in it proper place for though our mind can notconceive of god without ascribe some worship to him it will notbe sufficient merely to apprehend that he be the only proper object of universal worship and adoration unless we be also persuade that he be the fountain of all good and seek for none but in him this i maintain notonly because he sustain the universe a he once make it by hi infinite power governs it by hi wisdom preserve it by hi goodness and especially reign over the human race in righteousness and judgment exercise a merciful forbearance and defend them by hi protection but because there can notbe find the least particle of wisdom light righteousness power rectitude or sincere truth which do notproceed from him and claim him for it author we should therefore learn to expect and supplicate all these thing from him and thankfully to acknowledge what he give u for this sense of the divine perfection be calculate to teach u piety which produce religion by piety i mean a reverence and love of god arise from a knowledge of hi benefit for till men be sensible that they owe every thing to god that they be support by hi paternal care that he be the author of all the blessing they enjoy and that nothing should be seek independently of him they will never voluntarily submit to hi authority they will never truly and cordially devote themselves to hi service unless they rely upon him alone for true felicity cold and frivolous then be the speculation of those who employ themselves in disquisition on the essence of god when it would be more interesting to u to become acquainted with hi character and to know what be agreeable to hi nature for what end be answer by profess with epicurus that there be a god who discard all concern about the world indulge himself in perpetual inactivity what benefit arises from the knowledge of a god with whom we have no concern our knowledge of god should rather tend first to teach u fear and reverence and secondly to instruct u to implore all good at hi hand and to render him the praise of all that we receive for how can you entertain a thought of god without immediately reflect that be a creature of hi formation you must by right of creation be subject to hi authority that you be indebted to him for your life and that all your action should be do with reference to him if this be true it certainly follow that your life be miserably corrupt unless it be regulate by a desire of obey him since hi will ought to be the rule of our conduct nor can you have a clear view of him without discover him to be the fountain and origin of all good this would produce a desire of union to him and confidence in him if the human mind be notseduce by it own depravity from the right path of investigation for even at the first the pious mind dream notof any imaginary deity but contemplate only the one true god and concern him indulge notthe fiction of fancy but content with believe him to be such a he reveal himself use the most diligent and unremitting caution l it should fall into error by a rash and presumptuous transgression of hi will he who thus know him sensible that all thing be subject to hi control confides in him a hi guardian and protector and unreservedly commit himself to hi care assured that he be the author of all blessing in distress or want he immediately fly to hi protection and expect hi aid persuaded of hi goodness and mercy he rely on him with unlimited confidence nor doubt of find in hi clemency a remedy provide for all hi evil know him to be hi lord and father he conclude that he ought to mark hi government in all thing revere hi majesty endeavour to promote hi glory and obey hi command perceive him to be a just judge arm with severity for the punishment of crime he keep hi tribunal always in view and be restrain by fear from provoke hi wrath yet he be notso terrify at the apprehension of hi justice a to wish to evade it even if escape be possible but love him as much in punish the wicked a in bless the pious because he believe it a necessary to hi glory to punish the impious and abandon a to reward the righteous with eternal life besides he restrain himself from sin notmerely from a dread of vengeance but because he love and revere god a hi father honour and worship him a hi lord and even though there be no hell would shudder at the thought of offend him see then the nature of pure and genuine religion it consist in faith united with a serious fear of god comprehend a voluntary reverence and produce legitimate worship agreeable to the injunction of the law and this require to be the more carefully remark because men in general render to god a formal worship but very few truly reverence him while great ostentation in ceremony be universally display but sincerity of heart be rarely to be find the human mind naturally endued with the knowledge of god we lay it down a a position notto be controvert that the human mind even by natural instinct possess some sense of a deity for that no man might shelter himself under the pretext of ignorance god hath give to all some apprehension of hi existence the memory of which he frequently and insensibly renews so that a men universally know that there be a god and that he be their maker they must be condemn by their own testimony for nothave worship him and consecrate their life to hi service if we seek for ignorance of a deity it be nowhere more likely to be find than among tribes the most stupid and furthest from civilization but a the celebrated cicero observes there be no nation so barbarous no race so savage a notto be firmly persuade of the be of a god even those who in other respect appear to differ but little from brute always retain some sense of religion so fully be the mind of men possess with this common principle which be closely interwoven with their original composition now since there have never be a country or family from the beginning of the world totally destitute of religion it be a tacit confession that some sense of the divinity be inscribe on every heart of this opinion idolatry itself furnish ample proof for we know how reluctantly man would degrade himself to exalt other creature above him hi preference of worship a piece of wood or stone to be think to have no god evince the impression of a deity on the human mind to be very strong the obliteration of which be more difficult than a total change of the natural disposition and this be certainly change whenever man leave hi natural pride and voluntarily descends to such meanness under the notion of worship god it be most absurd then to pretend a be assert by some that religion be the contrivance of a few subtle and design men a political machine to confine the simple multitude to their duty while those who inculcate the worship of god on other be themselves far from believe that any god exist i confess indeed that artful men have introduce many invention into religion to fill the vulgar with reverence and strike them with terror in order to obtain the great command over their mind but this they never could have accomplish if the mind of men have notpreviously be possess of a firm persuasion of the existence of god from which the propensity to religion proceeds and that they who cunningly impose on the illiterate under the pretext of religion be themselves wholly destitute of any knowledge of god be quite incredible for though there be some in ancient time and many arise in the present age who deny the existence of god yet in spite of their reluctance they be continually receive proof of what they desire to disbelieve we read of no one guilty of more audacious or unbridled contempt of the deity than caligula yet no man ever tremble with great distress at any instance of divine wrath so that he be constrain to dread the divinity whom he profess to despise this you may always see exemplified in person of similar character for the most audacious contemn of god be most alarmed even at the noise of a fall leaf whence arise this but from the vengeance of the divine majesty smite their conscience the more powerfully in proportion to their effort to fly from it they try every refuge to hide themselves from the lord presence and to efface it from their mind but their attempt to elude it be all in vain though it may seem to disappear for a moment it presently return with increased violence so that if they have any remission of the anguish of conscience it resemble the sleep of person intoxicate or subject to frenzy who enjoy no placid rest while sleep be continually harass with horrible and tremendous dream the impious themselves therefore exemplify the observation that the idea of a god be never lose in the human mind it will always be evident to person of correct judgment that the idea of a deity impress on the mind of man be indelible that all have by nature an innate persuasion of the divine existence a persuasion inseparable from their very constitution we have abundant evidence in the contumacy of the wicked whose furious struggle to extricate themselves from the fear of god be unavailing though diagoras and other like him turn to ridicule what all age have believe of religion though dionysius scoff at the judgment of heavenit be but a forced laughter for the worm of a guilty conscience torment them within bad than if they be sear with hot iron i agree notwith cicero that errors in process of time become obsolete and that religion be increase and ameliorate daily for the world a will shortly be observe use it utmost endeavour to banish all knowledge of god and try every method of corrupt hi worship i only maintain that while the stupid insensibility which the wicked wish to acquire to promote their contempt of god prey upon their mind yet the sense of a deity which they ardently desire to extinguish be still strong and frequently discovers itself whence we infer that this be a doctrine notfirst to be learn in the school but which every man from hi birth be selftaught and which though many strain every nerve to banish it from them yet nature itself permit none to forget now if the end for which all men be bear and live be to know godand unless the knowledge of god have reach this point it be uncertain and vainit be evident that all who direct notevery thought and action of life to this end be degenerate from the law of their creation of this the heathen philosopher themselves be notignorant this be plato meaning when he teach that the chief good of the soul consist in similitude to god when the soul have a clear knowledge of him be wholly transform into hi likeness the reasoning also of gryllus in plutarch be very accurate when he affirm that men entirely destitute of religion notonly do notexcel the brute but be in many respect far more wretched be obnoxious to evil under so many form and always drag on a tumultuous and restless life the worship of god be therefore the only thing which render men superior to brute and make them aspire to immortality this knowledge extinguished or corrupted partly by ignorance partly by wickedness while experience testifies that the seed of religion be sow by god in every heart we scarcely find one man in a hundred who cherish what he have receive and notone in whom they grow to maturity much less bear fruit in due season some perhaps grow vain in their own superstition while other revolt from god with intentional wickedness but all degenerate from the true knowledge of him the fact be that no genuine piety remain in the world but in say that some fall into superstition through error i would notinsinuate that their ignorance excuse them from guilt because their blindness be always connect with pride vanity and contumacy pride and vanity be discover when miserable men in seek after god rise nota they ought above their own level but judge of him accord to their carnal stupidity and leave the proper path of investigation in pursuit of speculation as vain a they be curious their conception of him be form notaccord to the representation he give of himself but by the invention of their own presumptuous imagination this gulf be open whatever course they take they must be rush forward to destruction none of their subsequent attempt for the worship or service of god can be consider a render to him because they worship nothim but a figment of their own brain in hi stead this depravity paul expressly remark profess themselves to be wise they become fool he have before say they become vain in their imagination but l any should exculpate them he add that they be deservedly blind because notcontent within the bound of sobriety but arrogate to themselves more than be right they wilfully darken and even infatuate themselves with pride vanity and perverseness whence it follow that their folly be inexcusable which originate notonly in a vain curiosity but in false confidence and an immoderate desire to exceed the limit of human knowledge david assertion that the fool hath say in hi heart there be no god be primarily a we shall soon see in another place to be restrict to those who extinguish the light of nature and wilfully stupefy themselves for we see many become harden by bold and habitual transgression strive to banish all remembrance of god which the instinct of nature be still suggest to their mind to render their madness more detestable he introduce them a expressly deny the existence of god notthat they deprive him of hi be but because they rob him of hi justice and providence shut him up a an idler in heaven now a nothing would be more inconsistent with deity than to abandon the government of the world leave it to fortune and connive at the crime of men that they might wanton with impunitywhoever extinguishes all fear of the heavenly judgment and indulge himself in security denies that there be any god after the impious have wilfully shut their own eye it be the righteous vengeance of god upon them to darken their understanding so that see they may notperceive david be the best interpreter of hi own meaning in another place where he say the wicked have no fear of god before their eye and again that they encourage themselves in their iniquity with the flatter persuasion that god doth notsee them though they be constrain to acknowledge the existence of god yet they rob him of hi glory by detract from hi power for a god accord to the testimony of paul can notdeny himself because he perpetually remain like himselfthose who feign him to be a vain and lifeless image be truly say to deny god it must also be remark that though they strive against their own natural understanding and desire notonly to banish him thence but even to annihilate him in heaven their insensibility can never prevail so a to prevent god from sometimes recall them to hi tribunal but a no dread restrain them from violent opposition to the divine will it be evident as long a they be carry away with such a blind impetuosity that they be govern by a brutish forgetfulness of god thus be overthrow the vain excuse plead by many for their superstition for they satisfy themselves with any attention to religion however preposterous notconsider that the divine will be the perpetual rule to which true religion ought to be conform that god ever continue like himself that he be no spectre or phantasm to be metamorphose accord to the fancy of every individual it be easy to see how superstition mock god with hypocritical service while it attempt to please him for embrace only those thing which he declare he disregard it either contemptuously practises or even openly reject what he prescribe and declare to be please in hi sight person who introduce newlyinvented method of worship god really worship and adore the creature of their distempered imagination for they would never have dare to trifle in such a manner with god if they have notfirst feign a god conformable to their own false and foolish notion wherefore the apostle pronounce a vague and unsettled notion concern the deity to be ignorance of god when ye know notgod say he ye do service unto them which by nature be no god and in another place he speak of the ephesian a have be without god while they be stranger to a right knowledge of the only true god nor in this respect be it of much importance whether you imagine to yourself one god or more for in either case you depart and revolt from the true god and forsake him you have nothing leave you but an execrable idol we must therefore decide with lactantius that there be no legitimate religion unconnected with truth another sin be that they never think of god but against their inclination nor approach him till their reluctance be overcome by constraint and then they be influence notby a voluntary fear proceed from reverence of the divine majesty but by a servile and constrain fear extort by the divine judgment which they dread because it be inevitable at the same time that they hate it now to impiety and to this specie of it alone be applicable that assertion of statius that fear first make god in the world they whose mind be alienate from the righteousness of god earnestly desire the subversion of that tribunal which they know to be establish for the punishment of transgression against it with this disposition they wage war against the lord who can notbe deprive of hi judgment but when they apprehend hi irresistible arm to be impend over their head unable to avert or evade it they tremble with fear that they may notseem altogether to despise him whose majesty trouble them they practise some form of religion at the same time notcease to pollute themselves with vice of every kind and to add one flagitious act to another till they have violate every part of god holy law and dissipate all it righteousness it be certain at least that they be notprevent by that pretend fear of god from enjoy pleasure and satisfaction in their sin practise selfadulation and prefer the indulgence of their own carnal intemperance to the salutary restraint of the holy spirit but that be a false and vain shadow of religion and scarcely worthy even to be call it shadowit be easy to infer the wide difference between such a confused notion of god and the piety which be instill only into the mind of the faithful and be the source of religion yet hypocrite who be fly from god resort to the artifice of superstition for the sake of appear devote to him for whereas the whole tenor of their life ought to be a perpetual course of obedience to him they make no scruple of rebel against him in almost all their action only endeavour to appease him with a few paltry sacrifice whereas he ought to be serve with sanctity of life and integrity of heart they invent frivolous trifle and worthless observance to conciliate hi favour they abandon themselves to their impurity with the great licentiousness because they confide in be able to discharge all their duty to him by ridiculous expiation in a word whereas their confidence ought to be place on him they neglect him and depend upon themselves or on other creature at length they involve themselves in such a vast accumulation of error that those spark which enable them to discover the glory of god be smother and at last extinguish by the criminal darkness of iniquity that seed which it be impossible to eradicate a sense of the existence of a deity yet remain but so corrupt a to produce only the bad of fruit yet this be a further proof of what i now contend for that an idea of god be naturally engrave on the heart of men since necessity extort a confession of it even from reprobate themselves in the moment of tranquillity they facetiously mock the divine being and with loquacious impertinence derogate from hi power but if any despair oppress them it stimulate them to seek him and dictate concise prayer which prove that they be notaltogether ignorant of god but that what ought to have appear before have be suppress by obstinacy the knowledge of god conspicuous in the formation and continual government of the world a the perfection of a happy life consist in the knowledge of god that no man might be preclude from attain felicity god hath notonly sow in the mind of men the seed of religion already mention but hath manifest himself in the formation of every part of the world and daily present himself to public view in such a manner that they can notopen their eye without be constrain to behold him hi essence indeed be incomprehensible so that hi majesty be notto be perceive by the human sens but on all hi work he hath inscribe hi glory in character so clear unequivocal and strike that the most illiterate and stupid can notexculpate themselves by the plea of ignorance the psalmist therefore with great propriety exclaim he covereth himself with light a with a garment a if he have say that hi first appearance in visible apparel be at the creation of the world when he display those glory which be still conspicuous on every side in the same place the psalmist compare the expanded heaven to a royal pavilionhe say that he layeth the beam of hi chamber in the water maketh the cloud hi chariot walketh upon the wing of the wind and maketh the wind and the lightning hi swift messenger and because the glory of hi power and wisdom be more refulgently display above heaven be generally call hi palace and in the first place whithersoever you turn your eye there be notan atom of the world in which you can notbehold some brilliant spark at least of hi glory but you can notat one view take a survey of this most ample and beautiful machine in all it vast extent without be completely overwhelm with it infinite splendour wherefore the author of the epistle to the hebrew elegantly represent the world a the manifestation of invisible thing for the exact symmetry of the universe be a mirror in which we may contemplate the otherwise invisible god for which reason the psalmist attribute to the celestial body a language universally know for they afford a testimony of the deity too evident to escape the observation even of the most ignorant people in the world but the apostle more distinctly assert this manifestation to men of what be useful to be know concern god for the invisible thing of him from the creation of the world be clearly see be understand by the thing that be make even hi eternal power and godhead of hi wonderful wisdom both heaven and earth contain innumerable proof notonly those more abstruse thing which be the subject of astronomy medicine and the whole science of physic but those thing which force themselves on the view of the most illiterate of mankind so that they can notopen their eye without be constrain to witness them adept indeed in those liberal art or person just initiate into them be thereby enable to proceed much far in investigate the secret of divine wisdom yet ignorance of those science prevent no man from such a survey of the workmanship of god a be more than sufficient to excite hi admiration of the divine architect in disquisition concern the motion of the star in fix their situation measure their distance and distinguish their peculiar property there be need of skill exactness and industry and the providence of god be more clearly reveal by these discovery the mind ought to rise to a sublime elevation for the contemplation of hi glory but since the mean and most illiterate of mankind who be furnish with no other assistance than their own eye can notbe ignorant of the excellence of the divine skill exhibit itself in that endless yet regular variety of the innumerable celestial hostit be evident that the lord abundantly manifest hi wisdom to every individual on earth thus it belong to a man of preminent ingenuity to examine with the critical exactness of galen the connection the symmetry the beauty and the use of the various part of the human body but the composition of the human body be universally acknowledge to be so ingenious a to render it maker the object of deserved admiration and therefore some of the philosopher of antiquity have justly call man a microcosm or world in miniature because he be an eminent specimen of the power goodness and wisdom of god and contains in him wonder enough to occupy the attention of our mind if we be notindispose to such a study for this reason paul have remark that the blind might feel after god and find him immediately add that he be notfar from every one of u because every man have undoubtedly an inward perception of the celestial goodness by which he be quicken but if to attain some idea of god it be notnecessary for u to go beyond ourselves what an unpardonable indolence be it in those who will notdescend into themselves that they may find him for the same reason david have briefly celebrate the wonderful name and honour of god which be universally conspicuous immediately exclaim what be man that thou art mindful of him again out of the mouth of babe and suckling thou hast ordained strength thus declare notonly that the human race be a clear mirror of the work of god but that even infant at the breast have tongue so eloquent for the publication of hi glory that there be no necessity for other orator whence he hesitate notto produce them a fully capable of confute the madness of those whose diabolical pride would wish to extinguish the name of god hence also what paul quote from aratus that we be the offspring of god since hi adorn u with such great excellence have prove him to be our father so from the dictate of common sense and experience the heathen poet call him the father of men nor will any man freely devote himself to the service of god unless he have be allure to love and reverence him by first experience hi paternal love but herein appear the vile ingratitude of menthat while they ought to be proclaim the praise of god for the wonderful skill display in their formation and the inestimable bounty he bestow on them they be only inflated with the great pride they perceive how wonderfully god work within them and experience teach them what a variety of blessing they receive from hi liberality they be constrain to know whether willingly or notthat these be proof of hi divinity yet they suppress this knowledge in their heart indeed they need notgo out of themselves provide they do notby arrogate to themselves what be give from heaven smother the light which illuminate their mind to a clearer discovery of god even in the present day there be many men of monstrous disposition who hesitate notto pervert all the seed of divinity sow in the nature of man in order to bury in oblivion the name of god how detestable be this frenzy that man discover in hi body and soul a hundred vestige of god should make this very excellence a pretext for the denial of hi be they will notsay that they be distinguish from the brute by chance but they ascribe it to nature which they consider a the author of all thing and remove god out of sight they perceive most exquisite workmanship in all their member from the head to the foot here also they substitute nature in the place of god but above all the rapid motion of the soul it noble faculty and excellent talent discover a divinity noteasily conceal unless the epicurean like the cyclops from this eminence should audaciously wage war against god do all the treasure of heavenly wisdom concur in the government of a worm five foot in length and shall the universe be destitute of this privilege to state that there be in the soul a certain machinery corresponding to every part of the body be so far from obscure the divine glory that it be rather an illustration of it let epicurus answer what concourse of atom in the concoction of food and drink distributes part into excrement and part into blood and cause the several member to perform their different office with as much diligence a if so many soul by common consent govern one body but my present concern be notwith that sty of swine i rather address those who influence by preposterous subtilties would indirectly employ that frigid dogma of aristotle to destroy the immortality of the soul and deprive god of hi right for because the organ of the body be direct by the faculty of the soul they pretend the soul to be so united to the body a to be incapable of subsist without it and by their eulogy of nature do all they can to suppress the name of god but the power of the soul be far from be limit to function subservient to the body for what concern have the body in measure the heaven count the number of the star compute their several magnitude and acquire a knowledge of their respective distance of the celerity or tardiness of their course and of the degree of their various declination i grant indeed the usefulness of astronomy but only remark that in these profound research relate to the celestial orb there be no corporeal coperation but that the soul have it function distinct from the body i have propose one example whence inference may readily be draw by the reader the manifold agility of the soul which enable it to take a survey of heaven and earth to join the past and the present to retain the memory of thing hear long ago to conceive of whatever it choose by the help of imagination it ingenuity also in the invention of such admirable artsare certain proof of the divinity in man besides in sleep it notonly turn and move itself round but conceive many useful idea reason on various subject and even divine future event what shall we say but that the vestige of immortality impress upon man be absolutely indelible now what reason can be give why man who be of divine original should notacknowledge hi creator shall we indeed by the judgment with which we be endue discern right from wrong and shall there be no judge in heaven shall we even in our sleep have some remains of intelligence and shall there be no god to govern the world shall we be esteem the invent of so many useful art that god may be defraud of hi praise whereas experience abundantly teach that all we have be variously distribute to u by some superior be the clamour of some about a secret inspiration animate the whole world be notonly weak but altogether profane they be pleased with the celebrated passage of virgil know first a spirit with an active flame fill feed and animate this mighty frame run through the watery worlds the field of air the ponderous earth the depth of heaven and there glow in the sun and moon and burn in every star thus mingling with the mass the general soul live in the part and agitate the whole from that celestial energy begin the lowbrowed brute th imperial race of man the painted bird who wing th arial plain and all the mighty monster of the main their soul at first from high olympus come c just a if the world which be a theatre erect for display the glory of god be it own creator for thus write the same poet in another place follow the common opinion of the greek and latin led by such wonder sage have opine that bee have portion of a heavenly mind that god pervades and like one common soul fill feed and animate the world great whole that flock herd beast and men from him receive their vital breath in him all move and live that souls discerpt from him shall never die but back resolve to god and heaven shall fly and live for ever in the starry sky see the efficacy of that jejune speculation concern a universal mind animating and actuate the world in the production and encouragement of piety in the human heart this more fully appear also from the profane expression of the filthy lucretius which be deduction from the same principle it true tendency be to set up a shadowy deity and to banish all idea of the true god the proper object of fear and worship i confess indeed that the expression that nature be god may be use in a pious sense by a pious mind but a it be harsh and inconsistent with strict propriety of speech nature be rather an order prescribe by god it be dangerous in matter so momentous and demand peculiar caution to confound the deity with the inferior course of hi work let u remember then in every consideration of our own nature that there be one god who govern all nature and who expect u to regard him to direct our faith to him to worship and invoke him for nothing be more preposterous than to enjoy such splendid advantage which proclaim within u their divine origin and to neglect the author who bountifully bestow them now what illustrious specimen of hi power have we to arrest our attention unless it be possible for u notto know what strength be require to sustain with hi word this immense fabric of heaven and earth now by hi mere nod to shake the heaven with roar peal of thunder to consume whatever he choose with lightning and set the atmosphere on fire with the flame now to disturb it with tempest in various form and immediately if he please to compose all to instantaneous serenity to restrain suspended a it be in air the sea which by it elevation seem to threaten the earth with continual devastation now raise it in a tremendous manner by the tumultuous violence of the wind and now appease the wave to render it calm to this purpose be the numerous praise of the power of god drawn from the testimony of nature particularly in the book of job and in the prophecy of isaiah which i now purposely omit a they will be more suitably introduce when i discuss the scriptural account of the creation of the world only i wish at present to hint that this way of seek god by trace the lineament which both above and below u exhibit such a lively adumbration of him be common to alien and to those who belong to hi family hi power lead u to the consideration of hi eternity because he from whom all thing derive their origin must necessarily be eternal and selfexistent but if we inquire the reason that induce him first to create all thing and now to preserve them we shall find the sole cause to be hi own goodness but though this be the only cause it should be more than sufficient to attract u to love him since accord to the psalmist there be no creature that do notparticipate in the effusion of hi mercy in the second specie of hi work such a happen out of the ordinary course of nature the proof of hi perfection be equally clear for he so regulate hi providence in the government of human society that while he exhibit in innumerable way hi benignity and beneficence to all he likewise declares by evident and daily indication hi clemency to the pious and hi severity to the wicked and ungodly for no doubt can be entertain respect hi punishment of flagitious crime inasmuch a he clearly demonstrate himself to be the guardian and avenger of innocence in prosper with hi bless the life of good men in assist their necessity assuage and comfort their sorrow alleviate their calamity and provide in all thing for their safety nor should it perplex or eclipse hi perpetual rule of righteousness that he frequently permit the wicked and guilty for a time to exult in impunity but suffers good men to be undeservedly harass with much adversity and even to be oppress by the iniquitous malice of the ungodly we ought rather to make a very different reflection that when he clearly manifest hi wrath in the punishment of one sin he hat all sin and that since he now pass by many sin unpunished there will be a judgment hereafter till which the punishment be defer so also what ample occasion he supply u for the consideration of hi mercy while with unwearied benignity he pursue the miserable call them back to himself with more than paternal indulgence till hi beneficence overcome their depravity to this end the psalmist mentioning that god in desperate case suddenly and wonderfully succor beyond all expectation those who be miserable and ready to perish either protect from beast of prey such a be wander in desert and at length reconducting them into the right way or supply with food the needy and hungry or deliver captive from dreary dungeon and iron chain or bring the shipwrecked safe into port or heal the disease of some who be almost dead or scorch the earth with excessive heat and drought or fertilize it with the secret shower of hi mercy or elevate the mean of the vulgar or degrade noble from their dignify stationsthe psalmist i say have propose such example a these infers from them that what be account fortuitous accident be so many proof of hi heavenly providence especially of hi paternal clemency and that hence the pious have cause to rejoice while the mouth of the impious and reprobate be stop but since the majority of men immerse in their error be blind amidst the great opportunity of see he account it a rare instance of singular wisdom discreetly to consider these work of god from the sight of which some who in other instance discover the great acuteness receive no benefit and notwithstanding all the display of the glory of god scarcely one man in a hundred be really a spectator of it hi power and wisdom be equally conspicuous hi power be illustriously manifest when the ferocity of the impious universally deem insuperable be quell in an instant their arrogance subdue their strong fortress demolish their weapon and armour break in piece their strength diminish their machination confound and they fall by their own exertion when the audacity which exalt itself above the heaven be throw down to the centre of the earth when on the contrary the poor be raise out of the dust and the needy out of the dunghill the oppress and afflict extricate from distress extremity and the desperate restore to a good hope when the unarmed be victorious over those who be arm the few over the many the weak over the strong but hi wisdom be eminently display in order every dispensation at the best possible time confound the great worldly sagacity take the wise in their own craftiness and finally dispose all thing accord to the dictate of the high reason we see that there be no need of any long or laborious argumentation to obtain and produce testimony for illustrate and assert the divine majesty since from the few which we have select and cursorily mention it appear that they be every where so evident and obvious a easily to be distinguish by the eye and point out with the finger and here it must again be observe that we be invite to a knowledge of god notsuch a content with empty speculation merely float in the brain but such a will be solid and fruitful if rightly receive and root in our heart for the lord be manifest by hi perfection perceive the influence and enjoy the benefit of which we must necessarily be more acutely impressed with such a knowledge than if we imagine a deity of whose influence we have no perception whence we conclude this to be the right way and the best method of seek god notwith presumptuous curiosity to attempt an examination of hi essence which be rather to be adore than too curiously investigate but to contemplate him in hi work in which he approach and familiarizes and in some measure communicate himself to u to this the apostle refer when he say that he be notto be seek far off since by hi attribute of omnipresence he dwell in every one of u therefore david have before confess hi greatness ineffable after he descend to the mention of hi work add that he will declare this greatness wherefore it become u also to apply ourselves to such an investigation of god a may fill our understand with admiration and powerfully interest our feeling and a augustine somewhere teach be incapable of comprehend him and fainting a it be under hi immensity we must take a view of hi work that we may be refresh with hi goodness now such a knowledge ought notonly to excite u to the worship of god but likewise to awaken and arouse u to the hope of a future life for when we consider that the specimen give by the lord both of hi clemency and of hi severity be only begin and notcomplete we certainly should esteem these a prelude to great thing of which the manifestation and full exhibition be defer to another life when we see that pious men be load with affliction by the impious harass with injury oppress with calumny and vexed with contumelious and opprobrious treatment that the wicked on the contrary flourish prosper obtain ease and dignity and all with impunitywe should immediately conclude that there be another life to which be reserve the vengeance due to iniquity and the reward of righteousness moreover when we observe the faithful frequently chastise by the lord rod we may conclude with great certainty that the impious shall notalways escape hi vengeance for that be a wise observation of augustineif open punishment be now inflict for every sin it would be suppose that nothing would be reserve till the last judgment again if god now do notopenly punish any sin it would be presume that there be no divine providence it must therefore be confess that in each of the work of god but more especially in the whole consider together there be a bright exhibition of the divine perfection by which the whole human race be invite and allure to the knowledge of god and thence to true and complete felicity but though those perfection be most luminously portray around u we only discover their principal tendency their use and the end of our contemplation of them when we descend into our own self and consider by what mean god display in u hi life wisdom and power and exercise towards u hi righteousness goodness and mercy for though david justly complain that unbeliever be fool because they consider notthe profound design of god in the government of mankind yet there be much truth in what he say in another placethat the wonder of divine wisdom in this respect exceed in number the hair of our head but a this argument must be treat more at large in due course i at present omit it but notwithstanding the clear representation give by god in the mirror of hi work both of himself and of hi everlasting dominion such be our stupidity that always inattentive to these obvious testimony we derive no advantage from them for with regard to the structure and very beautiful organization of the world how few of u be there who when lift up their eye to heaven or look round on the various region of the earth direct their mind to the remembrance of the creator and do notrather content themselves with a view of hi work to the total neglect of their author and with respect to those thing that daily happen out of the ordinary course of nature be it notthe general opinion that men be roll and whirl about by the blind temerity of fortune rather than govern by the providence of god or if by the guidance and direction of these thing we be ever drive a all men must sometimes be to the consideration of a god yet when we have rashly conceive an idea of some deity we soon slide into our own carnal dream or deprave invention corrupt by our vanity the purity of divine truth we differ from one another in that each individual imbibe some peculiarity of error but we perfectly agree in a universal departure from the one true god to preposterous trifle this disease affect notonly the vulgar and ignorant but the most eminent and those who in other thing discover peculiar sagacity how abundantly have all the philosopher in this respect betray their stupidity and folly for to spare other chargeable with great absurdity plato himself the most religious and judicious of them all lose himself in hi round globe and what would notbefall other when their principal men whose place it be to enlighten the rest stumble upon such gross error so also while the government of human action prove a providence too plainly to admit of a denial men derive no more advantage from it than if they believe all thing to be agitate forward and backwards by the uncertain caprice of fortune so great be our propensity to vanity and error i speak exclusively of the excellent of mankind notof the vulgar whose madness in the profanation of divine truth have know no bound hence that immense flood of error which have deluge the whole world for every man understanding be like a labyrinth to him so that it be notto be wonder at that the different nation be draw aside into various invention and even that almost every individual have hi own particular deity for amidst the union of temerity and wantonness with ignorance and darkness scarcely a man could be find who do notframe to himself some idol or phantasm instead of god indeed the immense multitude of god proceed from the mind of man resemble the ebullition of water from a vast and ample spring while every one with an extreme licentiousness of error invents one thing or another concern god himself it be notnecessary here to compose a catalogue of the superstition which have perplex the world for it would be an endless task and without a word more be say the horrible blindness of the human mind sufficiently appear from such a multiplicity of corruption i pass over the rude and unlearned vulgar but among the philosopher who attempt with reason and learning to penetrate heaven how shameful be the diversity in proportion to the vigour of hi natural genius and the polish acquire by art and science each of them seem to give the more specious colour to hi own opinion but on a close inspection you will find them all fading colour the stoic say in their own opinion very shrewdly that from all the part of nature may be collect various name of god but yet that the one god be nottherefore divide a if we be notalready too much incline to vanity without be further and more violently seduce into error by the notion of such a various abundance of god the mystical theology of the egyptian also show that they all sedulously endeavour to preserve the appearance of reason in the midst of their folly and any thing apparently probable might at first sight perhaps deceive the simple and incautious but there never be any human invention by which religion be notbasely corrupt and this confused diversity imboldened the epicurean and other gross despisers of piety to reject all idea of god for see the wise of men contend with each other for contrary opinion they hesitate notfrom their dissension and from the frivolous and absurd doctrine maintain by the different party to infer that it be vain and foolish for men to torment themselves with investigation concern god who do notexist and this they think they might do with impunity suppose that a compendious denial of any god at all would be good than feign uncertain god and thereby occasion endless controversy they reason very ignorantly or rather endeavour to conceal their own impiety behind the ignorance of men which notat all justifies any encroachment on god but from the general confession that there be no subject productive of so many dissension among the learn as well a the unlearned it be infer that the mind of men which err so much in investigation concern god be extremely blind and stupid in celestial mystery other commend the answer of simonides who be ask by hiero the tyrant what god be request a day to consider it when the tyrant the next day repeat the inquiry he beg to be allow two day longer and have often double the number of day at length answer the longer i consider the subject the more obscure it appear to me he prudently suspend hi opinion on a subject so obscure to him yet this show that men who be teach only by nature have no certain sound or distinct knowledge but be confine to confused principle so that they worship an unknown god now it must also be maintain that whoever adulterate the pure religion which must necessarily be the case of all who be influence by their own imagination he be guilty of a departure from the one god they will profess indeed a different intention but what they intend or what they persuade themselves be of little importance since the holy spirit pronounce all to be apostate who in the darkness of their mind substitute demon in the place of god for this reason paul declare the ephesian to have be without godtill they have learn from the gospel the worship of the true god nor should this be restrict to one nation only since in another place he assert of men in general that they become vain in their imagination after the majesty of the creator have be discover to them in the structure of the world and therefore the scripture to make room for the only true god condemns a false and lie whatever be formerly worship a divine among the gentile and leave no deity but in mount sion where flourish the peculiar knowledge of god indeed among the gentile the samaritan in the day of christ seem to approach very nearly to true piety yet we hear from the mouth of christ that they worship they know notwhat whence it follow that they be under a vain and erroneous delusion in fine though they be notall the subject of gross vice or open idolater there be no pure and approve religion their notion be found only in common sense for though there be a few uninfected with the madness of the vulgar this assertion of paul remain unshaken that none of the prince of this world know the wisdom of god but if the most exalted have be involve in the darkness of error what must be say of the dreg of the people wherefore it be notsurprising if the holy spirit reject a spurious every form of worship which be of human contrivance because in the mystery of heaven an opinion acquire by human mean though it may notalways produce an immense mass of error yet always produce some and though no bad consequence follow it be no trivial fault to worship at an uncertainty an unknown god of which however christ pronounce all to be guilty who have notbe teach by the law what god they ought to worship and indeed the best legislator have proceed no further than to declare religion to be found upon common consent and even socrates in xenophon praise the answer of apollo which direct that every man should worship the god accord to the rite of hi country and the custom of hi own city but whence have mortal this right of determine by their own authority what far exceed all the world or who could so acquiesce in the decree of the ruler or the ordinance of the people a without hesitation to receive a god deliver to him by the authority of man every man will rather abide by hi own judgment than be subject to the will of another since then the following of the custom of a city or the consent of antiquity in divine worship be too weak and frail a bond of piety it remain for god himself to give a revelation concern himself from heaven vain therefore be the light afford u in the formation of the world to illustrate the glory of it author which though it ray be diffuse all around u be insufficient to conduct u into the right way some spark indeed be kindle but smother before they have emit any great degree of light wherefore the apostle in the place before cite say by faith we understand that the world be frame by the word of god thus intimate that the invisible deity be represent by such visible object yet that we have no eye to discern him unless they be illuminate through faith by an internal revelation of god nor do paul where he observe that that which may be know of god be manifest in the creation of the world design such a manifestation a human sagacity may comprehend but rather show that it utmost extent be to render men inexcusable the same writer also though in one place he deny that god be to be trace far off see he dwell within u yet teach in another place the consequence of such a proximity god say he in time past suffer all nation to walk in their own way nevertheless he leave nothimself without witness in that he do good and give u rain from heaven and fruitful season fill our heart with food and gladness though the lord then be notdestitute of a testimony concern himself while with various and most abundant benignity he sweetly allure mankind to a knowledge of him yet they persist in follow their own way their pernicious and fatal error but whatever deficiency of natural ability prevents u from attain the pure and clear knowledge of god yet since that deficiency arise from our own fault we be leave without any excuse nor indeed can we set up any pretence of ignorance that will prevent our own conscience from perpetually accuse u of indolence and ingratitude truly it would be a defence worthy to be admit if a man should plead that he want ear to hear the truth for the publication of which even the mute creature be supply with most melodious voice if he should allege that hi eye be notcapable of see what be demonstrate by the creature without the help of the eye if he should plead mental imbecility while all the irrational creature instruct u wherefore we be justly exclude from all excuse for our uncertain and extravagant deviation since all thing conspire to show u the right way but however men be chargeable with sin corrupt the seed of divine knowledge which by the wonderful operation of nature be sow in their heart so that they produce no good and fair crop yet it be beyond a doubt that the simple testimony magnificently bear by the creature to the glory of god be very insufficient for our instruction for as soon a a survey of the world have just show u a deity neglect the true god we set up in hi stead the dream and phantasm of our own brain and confer on them the praise of righteousness wisdom goodness and power due to him we either obscure hi daily act or pervert them by an erroneous estimate thereby deprive the act themselves of their glory and their author of hi deserved praise the guidance and teaching of the scripture necessary to lead to the knowledge of god the creator though the light which present itself to all eye both in heaven and in earth be more than sufficient to deprive the ingratitude of men of every excuse since god in order to involve all mankind in the same guilt set before them all without exception an exhibition of hi majesty delineate in the creaturesyet we need another and good assistance properly to direct u to the creator of the world therefore he hath notunnecessarily add the light of hi word to make himself know unto salvation and hath honour with this privilege those whom he intend to unite in a more close and familiar connection with himself for see the mind of all men to be agitate with unstable disposition when he have choose the jew a hi peculiar flock he enclose them a in a fold that they might notwander after the vanity of other nation and it be notwithout cause that he preserve u in the pure knowledge of himself by the same mean for otherwise they who seem comparatively to stand firm would soon fall for a person who be old or whose eye be by any mean become dim if you show them the most beautiful book though they perceive something write but can scarcely read two word together yet by the assistance of spectacle will begin to read distinctlyso the scripture collecting in our mind the otherwise confused notion of deity dispel the darkness and give u a clear view of the true god this then be a singular favour that in the instruction of the church god notonly use mute teacher but even open hi own sacred mouth notonly proclaim that some god ought to be worship but at the same time pronounces himself to be the being to whom this worship be due and notonly teach the elect to raise their view to a deity but also exhibit himself a the object of their contemplation this method he hath observe toward hi church from the beginning beside those common lesson of instruction to afford them also hi word which furnish a more correct and certain criterion to distinguish him from all fictitious deity and it be undoubtedly by this assistance that adam noah abraham and the rest of the patriarch attain to that familiar knowledge which distinguish them from unbeliever i speak notyet of the peculiar doctrine of faith which illuminate them into the hope of eternal life for to pass from death to life they must have know god notonly a the creator but also a the redeemer a they certainly obtain both from hi word for that specie of knowledge which relate to him a the creator and governor of the world in order precede the other to this be afterwards add the other internal knowledge which alone vivify dead soul and apprehends god notonly a the creator of the world and a the sole author and arbiter of all event but also a the redeemer in the person of the mediator but be notyet come to the fall of man and the corruption of nature i also forbear to treat of the remedy let the reader remember therefore that i be notyet treat of that covenant by which god adopt the child of abraham and of that point of doctrine by which believer have always be particularly separate from the profane nation since that be found on christ but be only show how we ought to learn from the scripture that god who create the world may be certainly distinguish from the whole multitude of fictitious deity the series of subject will in due time lead u to redemption but though we shall adduce many testimony from the new testament and some also from the law and the prophet in which christ be expressly mention yet they will all tend to prove that the scripture discover god to u a the creator of the world and declare what sentiments we should form of him that we may notbe seek after a deity in a labyrinth of uncertainty but whether god reveal himself to the patriarch by oracle and vision or suggest by mean of the ministry of men what should be hand down by tradition to their posterity it be beyond a doubt that their mind be impressed with a firm assurance of the doctrine so that they be persuade and convince that the information they have receive come from god for god always secure to hi word an undoubted credit superior to all human opinion at length that the truth might remain in the world in a continual course of instruction to all age he determine that the same oracle which he have deposit with the patriarch should be commit to public record with this design the law be promulgate to which the prophet be afterwards annex a it interpretersfor though the us of the law be many a will be good see in the proper place and particularly the intention of moses and of all the prophet be to teach the mode of reconciliation between god and man whence also paul call christ the end of the lawyet i repeat again that beside the peculiar doctrine of faith and repentance which propose christ a the mediator the scripture distinguish the only true god by certain character and title a the creator and governor of the world that he may notbe confound with the multitude of false god therefore though every man should seriously apply himself to a consideration of the work of god be place in this very splendid theatre to be a spectator of them yet he ought principally to attend to the word that he may attain superior advantage and therefore it be notsurprising that they who be bear in darkness grow more and more harden in their stupidity since very few attend to the word of god with teachable disposition to restrain themselves within the limit which it prescribe but rather exult in their own vanity this then must be consider a a fixed principle that in order to enjoy the light of true religion we ought to begin with the doctrine of heaven and that no man can have the least knowledge of true and sound doctrine without have be a disciple of the scripture hence originate all true wisdom when we embrace with reverence the testimony which god hath be pleased therein to deliver concern himself for obedience be the source notonly of an absolutely perfect and complete faith but of all right knowledge of god and truly in this instance god hath in hi providence particularly consult the true interest of mankind in all age for if we consider the mutability of the human mindhow easy it lapse into forgetfulness of god how great it propensity to error of every kind how violent it rage for the perpetual fabrication of new and false religionsit will be easy to perceive the necessity of the heavenly doctrine be thus commit to write that it might notbe lose in oblivion or evaporate in error or be corrupt by the presumption of men since it be evident therefore that god foresee the inefficacy of hi manifestation of himself in the exquisite structure of the world hath afford the assistance of hi word to all those to whom he determine to make hi instruction effectualif we seriously aspire to a sincere contemplation of god it be necessary for u to pursue this right way we must come i say to the word which contain a just and lively description of god a he appear in hi work when those work be estimate notaccord to our depraved judgment but by the rule of eternal truth if we deviate from it a i have just observe though we run with the utmost celerity yet be out of the course we shall never reach the goal for it must be conclude that the light of the divine countenance which even the apostle say no man can approach unto be like an inexplicable labyrinth to u unless we be direct by the line of the word so that it be good to halt in this way than to run with the great rapidity out of it therefore david inculcate the necessity of the removal of superstition out of the world that pure religion may flourish frequently introduces god a reigning by the word reign intend notthe power which he possess and which he exercise in the universal government of nature but the doctrine in which he assert hi legitimate sovereignty because error can never be eradicate from the human heart till the true knowledge of god be implant in it therefore the same psalmist have say that the heaven declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth hi handywork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge afterwards proceeds to the mention of the word the law of the lord be perfect convert the soul the testimony of the lord be sure make wise the simple the statute of the lord be right rejoice the heart the commandment of the lord be pure enlighten the eye for though he also comprehend other us of the law yet he suggest in general that since god invitation of all nation to him by the view of heaven and earth be ineffectual this be the peculiar school of the child of god the same be advert to in the twentyninth psalm where the psalmist have preach the terror of the divine voice which in thunder in wind in shower in whirlwind and in tempest shake the earth make the mountain tremble and break the cedar add at length towards the close in hi temple doth every one speak of hi glory because unbeliever be deaf to all the voice of god which resound in the air so in another psalm after describe the terrible wave of the sea he conclude thus thy testimony be very sure holiness becometh thine house o lord for ever hence also proceed the observation of christ to the samaritan woman that her nation and all other worship they know notwhat and that the jew be the only worshipper of the true god for since the human mind be unable through it imbecility to attain any knowledge of god without the assistance of hi sacred word all mankind except the jew a they seek god without the word must necessarily have be wander in vanity and error the testimony of the spirit necessary to confirm the scripture in order to the complete establishment of it authority the suspension of it authority on the judgment of the church an impious fiction before i proceed any further it be proper to introduce some remark on the authority of the scripture notonly to prepare the mind to regard it with due reverence but also to remove every doubt for when it be admit to be a declaration of the word of god no man can be so deplorably presumptuous unless he be also destitute of common sense and of the common feeling of men a to dare to derogate from the credit due to the speaker but since we be notfavour with daily oracle from heaven and since it be only in the scripture that the lord hath be please to preserve hi truth in perpetual remembrance it obtain the same complete credit and authority with believer when they be satisfied of it divine origin a if they hear the very word pronounce by god himself the subject indeed merit a diffuse discussion and a most accurate examination but the reader will pardon me if i attend rather to what the design of this work admit than to what the extensive nature of the present subject require but there have very generally prevail a most pernicious error that the scripture have only so much weight a be concede to them by the suffrage of the church a though the eternal and inviolable truth of god depend on the arbitrary will of men for thus with great contempt of the holy spirit they inquire who can assure u that god be the author of them who can with certainty affirm that they have be preserve safe and uncorrupted to the present age who can persuade u that this book ought to be receive with reverence and that expunge from the sacred number unless all these thing be regulate by the decision of the church it depend therefore say they on the determination of the church to decide both what reverence be due to the scripture and what book be to be comprise in it canon thus sacrilegious men while they wish to introduce an unlimited tyranny under the name of the church be totally unconcerned with what absurdities they embarrass themselves and other provide they can extort from the ignorant this one admission that the church can do every thing but if this be true what will be the condition of those wretched conscience which be seek a solid assurance of eternal life if all the promise extant concern it rest only on the judgment of men will the reception of such an answer cause their fluctuation to subside and their terror to vanish again how will the impious ridicule our faith and all men call it in question if it be understand to possess only a precarious authority depend on the favour of men but such caviller be completely refute even by one word of the apostle he testify that the church be build upon the foundation of the apostle and prophet if the doctrine of the prophet and apostle be the foundation of the church it must have be certain antecedently to the existence of the church nor be there any foundation for this cavil that though the church derive it origin from the scripture yet it remain doubtful what writing be to be ascribe to the prophet and apostle unless it be determine by the church for if the christian church have be from the beginning found on the writing of the prophet and the preaching of the apostle wherever that doctrine be find the approbation of it have certainly precede the formation of the church since without it the church itself have never exist it be a very false notion therefore that the power of judging of the scripture belong to the church so a to make the certainty of it dependent on the church will wherefore when the church receive it and seal it with her suffrage she do notauthenticate a thing otherwise dubious or controvert but know it to be the truth of her god perform a duty of piety by treat it with immediate veneration but with regard to the question how shall we be persuade of it divine original unless we have recourse to the decree of the church this be just a if any one should inquire how shall we learn to distinguish light from darkness white from black sweet from bitter for the scripture exhibit a clear evidence of it truth a white and black thing do of their colour or sweet and bitter thing of their taste i know indeed that they commonly cite the opinion of augustine where he say that he would notbelieve the gospel unless he be influence by the authority of the church but how falsely and unfairly this be cite in support of such a notion it be easy to discover from the context he be in that contend with the manichee who wish to be credit without any controversy when they affirm the truth to be on their side but never prove it now a they make the authority of the gospel a pretext in order to establish the credit of their manichus he inquire what they would do if they meet with a man who do notbelieve the gospel with what kind of persuasion they would convert him to their opinion he afterwards add indeed i would notgive credit to the gospel c intending that he himself when an alien from the faith could notbe prevail on to embrace the gospel a the certain truth of god till he be convince by the authority of the church and be it surprise that any one yet destitute of the knowledge of christ should pay a respect to men augustine therefore do notthere maintain that the faith of the pious be found on the authority of the church nor do he mean that the certainty of the gospel depend on it but simply that unbeliever would have no assurance of the truth of the gospel that would win them to christ unless they be influence by the consent of the church and a little before he clearly confirm it in these word when i shall have commend my own creed and deride yours what judgment think you ought we to form what conduct ought we to pursue but to forsake those who invite u to acknowledge thing that be certain and afterwards command u to believe thing that be uncertain and to follow those who invite u first to believe what we can notyet clearly see that be strengthen by faith we may acquire an understanding of what we believe our mind be now internally strengthen and illuminate notby men but by god himself these be the express word of augustine whence the inference be obvious to every one that this holy man do notdesign to suspend our faith in the scripture on the arbitrary decision of the church but only to show what we all confess to be true that they who be yet unilluminated by the spirit of god be by a reverence for the church bring to such a docility a to submit to learn the faith of christ from the gospel and that thus the authority of the church be an introduction to prepare u for the faith of the gospel for we see that he will have the certainty of the pious to rest on a very different foundation otherwise i do notdeny hi frequently urge on the manichee the universal consent of the church with a view to prove the truth of the scripture which they reject whence hi rebuke of faustus for notsubmit to the truth of the gospel so found so establish so gloriously celebrate and deliver through certain succession from the apostolic age but he nowhere insinuate that the authority which we attribute to the scripture depend on the definition or decree of men he only produce the universal judgment of the church which be very useful to hi argument and give him an advantage over hi adversary if any one desire a fuller proof of this let him read hi treatise of the advantage of believing where he will find that he recommend no other facility of believe than such a may afford u an introduction and be a proper beginning of inquiry a he express himself yet that we should notbe satisfy with mere opinion but rest upon certain and solid truth it must be maintain a i have before assert that we be notestablish in the belief of the doctrine till we be indubitably persuade that god be it author the principal proof therefore of the scripture be every where derive from the character of the divine speaker the prophet and apostle boast notof their own genius or any of those talent which conciliate the faith of the hearer nor do they insist on argument from reason but bring forward the sacred name of god to compel the submission of the whole world we must now see how it appear notfrom probable supposition but from clear demonstration that this use of the divine name be neither rash nor fallacious now if we wish to consult the true interest of our conscience that they may notbe unstable and waver the subject of perpetual doubt that they may nothesitate at the small scruplesthis persuasion must be seek from a high source than human reason or judgment or conjectureseven from the secret testimony of the spirit it be true that if we be incline to argue the point many thing might be adduce which certainly evince if there be any god in heaven that he be the author of the law and the prophecy and the gospel even though men of learning and deep judgment rise up in opposition and exert and display all the power of their mind in this dispute yet unless they be wholly lose to all sense of shame this confession will be extort from them that the scripture exhibit the plainest evidence that it be god who speak in it which manifest it doctrine to be divine and we shall soon see that all the book of the sacred scripture very far excel all other writing if we read it with pure eye and sound mind we shall immediately perceive the majesty of god which will subdue our audacious contradiction and compel u to obey him yet it be act a preposterous part to endeavour to produce sound faith in the scripture by disputation though indeed i be far from excel in peculiar dexterity or eloquence yet if i be to contend with the most subtle despisers of god who be ambitious to display their wit and their skill in weaken the authority of scripture i trust i should be able without difficulty to silence their obstreperous clamour and if it be of any use to attempt a refutation of their cavil i would easily demolish the boast which they mutter in secret corner but though any one vindicate the sacred word of god from the aspersion of men yet this will notfix in their heart that assurance which be essential to true piety religion appear to profane men to consist wholly in opinion in order that they may notbelieve any thing on foolish or slight ground they wish and expect it to be prove by rational argument that moses and the prophet spake by divine inspiration but i reply that the testimony of the spirit be superior to all reason for a god alone be a sufficient witness of himself in hi own word so also the word will never gain credit in the heart of men till it be confirm by the internal testimony of the spirit it be necessary therefore that the same spirit who spake by the mouth of the prophet should penetrate into our heart to convince u that they faithfully deliver the oracle which be divinely intrust to them and this connection be very suitably express in these word my spirit that be upon thee and my word which i have put in thy mouth shall notdepart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed for ever some good men be trouble that they be notalways prepare with clear proof to oppose the impious when they murmur with impunity against the divine word a though the spirit be nottherefore denominate a seal and an earnest for the confirmation of the faith of the pious because till he illuminate their mind they be perpetually fluctuate amidst a multitude of doubt let it be consider then a an undeniable truth that they who have be inwardly teach by the spirit feel an entire acquiescence in the scripture and that it be selfauthenticated carry with it it own evidence and ought notto be make the subject of demonstration and argument from reason but it obtain the credit which it deserve with u by the testimony of the spirit for though it conciliate our reverence by it internal majesty it never seriously affect u till it be confirm by the spirit in our heart therefore be illuminate by him we now believe the divine original of the scripture notfrom our own judgment or that of other but we esteem the certainty that we have receive it from god own mouth by the ministry of men to be superior to that of any human judgment and equal to that of an intuitive perception of god himself in it we seek notargument or probability to support our judgment but submit our judgment and understanding a to a thing concern which it be impossible for u to judge and that notlike some person who be in the habit of hastily embrace what they do notunderstand which displease them as soon a they examine it but because we feel the firm conviction that we hold an invincible truth nor like those unhappy men who surrender their mind captive to superstition but because we perceive in it the undoubted energy of the divine power by which we be attract and inflame to an understanding and voluntary obedience but with a vigour and efficacy superior to the power of any human will or knowledge with the great justice therefore god exclaim by isaiah that the prophet and all the people be hi witness because be teach by prophecy they be certain that god have speak without the least fallacy or ambiguity it be such a persuasion therefore a require no reason such a knowledge a be support by the high reason in which indeed the mind rest with great security and constancy than in any reason it be finally such a sentiment a can notbe produce but by a revelation from heaven i speak of nothing but what every believer experience in hi heart except that my language fall far short of a just explication of the subject i pass over many thing at present because this subject will present itself for discussion again in another place only let it be know here that that alone be true faith which the spirit of god seal in our heart and with this one reason every reader of modesty and docility will be satisfy isaiah predict that all the child of the renovate church shall be teach of god herein god deign to confer a singular privilege on hi elect whom he distinguish from the rest of mankind for what be the beginning of true learning but a prompt alacrity to hear the voice of god by the mouth of moses he demand our attention in these term say notin thine heart who shall ascend into heaven or who shall descend into the deep the word be even in thy mouth if god hath determine that this treasury of wisdom shall be reserve for hi child it be neither surprising nor absurd that we see so much ignorance and stupidity among the vulgar herd of mankind by this appellation i designate even those of the great talent and high rank till they be incorporate into the church moreover isaiah observe that the prophetical doctrine would be incredible notonly to alien but also to the jew who wish to be esteemed member of the family add at the same time the reasonbecause the arm of the lord will notbe reveal to all whenever therefore we be disturb at the paucity of believer let u on the other hand remember that none but those to whom it be give have any apprehension of the mystery of god rational proof to establish the belief of the scripture without this certainty well and strong than any human judgment in vain will the authority of the scripture be either defend by argument or establish by the consent of the church or confirm by any other support since unless the foundation be lay it remain in perpetual suspense whilst on the contrary when regard it in a different point of view from common thing we have once religiously receive it in a manner worthy of it excellence we shall then derive great assistance from thing which before be notsufficient to establish the certainty of it in our mind for it be admirable to observe how much it conduce to our confirmation attentively to study the order and disposition of the divine wisdom dispense in it the heavenly nature of it doctrine which never savour of any thing terrestrial the beautiful agreement of all the part with each other and other similar character adapt to conciliate respect to any writing but our heart be more strongly confirm when we reflect that we be constrain to admire it more by the dignity of the subject than by the beauty of the language for even this do nothappen without the particular providence of god that the sublime mystery of the kingdom of heaven should be communicate for the most part in a humble and contemptible style l if they have be illustrate with more of the splendour of eloquence the impious might cavil that their triumph be only the triumph of eloquence now since that uncultivated and almost rude simplicity procure itself more reverence than all the grace of rhetoric what opinion can we form but that the force of truth in the sacred scripture be too powerful to need the assistance of verbal art justly therefore do the apostle argue that the faith of the corinthian be found notin the wisdom of men but in the power of god because hi preaching among them be notwith entice word of man wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power for the truth be vindicate from every doubt when unassisted by foreign aid it be sufficient for it own support but that this be the peculiar property of the scripture appear from the insufficiency of any human composition however artificially polish to make an equal impression on our mind read demosthenes or cicero read plato aristotle or any other of that class i grant that you will be attract delighted move and enrapture by them in a surprising manner but if after read them you turn to the perusal of the sacred volume whether you be willing or unwilling it will affect you so powerfully it will so penetrate your heart and impress itself so strongly on your mind that compare with it energetic influence the beauty of rhetorician and philosopher will almost entirely disappear so that it be easy to perceive something divine in the sacred scripture which far surpass the high attainment and ornament of human industry i grant indeed that the diction of some of the prophet be neat and elegant and even splendid so that they be notinferior in eloquence to the heathen writer and by such example the holy spirit hath be please to show that he be notdeficient in eloquence though elsewhere he hath use a rude and homely style but whether we read david isaiah and other that resemble them who have a sweet and pleasant flow of word or amos the herdsman jeremiah and zechariah whose rougher language savour of rusticitythat majesty of the spirit which i have mention be every where conspicuous i be notignorant that satan in many thing imitates god in order that by the fallacious resemblance he may more easily insinuate himself into the mind of the simple and have therefore craftily disseminate in unpolished and even barbarous language the most impious error by which multitude have be miserably deceive and have often use obsolete form of speech a a mask to conceal hi imposture but the vanity and fraud of such affectation be visible to all men of moderate understanding with respect to the sacred scripture though presumptuous men try to cavil at various passage yet it be evidently replete with sentence which be beyond the power of human conception let all the prophet be examine notone will be find who have notfar surpass the ability of men so that those to whom their doctrine be insipid must be account utterly destitute of all true taste this argument have be copiously treat by other writer wherefore it may suffice at present merely to hint at a few thing which chiefly relate to the subject in a general view beside what i have already treat on the antiquity of the scripture be of no small weight for notwithstanding the fabulous account of the greek writer concern the egyptian theology yet there remain no monument of any religion but what be much low than the age of moses nor do moses invent a new deity he only make a declaration of what the israelite have through a long series of year receive by tradition from their forefather concern the eternal god for what do he aim at but to recall them to the covenant make with abraham if he have advance a thing till then unheard of it would nothave be receive but their liberation from the servitude in which they be detain must have be a thing well know to them all so that the mention of it immediately excite universal attention it be probable also that they have be inform of the number of four hundred year now we must consider if moses who himself precede all other writer by such a long distance of time derive the tradition of hi doctrine from so remote a begin how much the sacred scripture exceed in antiquity all other book unless any would choose to credit the egyptian who extend their antiquity to six thousand year before the creation of the world but since their garrulity have be ridicule even by all the profane writer i need nottrouble myself with refute it josephus in hi book against appion cite from the most ancient writer testimony worthy of be remember whence we may gather that the doctrine contain in the law have accord to the consent of all nation be renowned from the remotest age although it be neither read nor truly understood now that the malicious might have no room for suspicion nor even the wicked any pretence for cavil god hath provide the most excellent remedy for both these danger when moses relate what jacob have almost three hundred year before by the spirit of inspiration pronounce concern hi posterity how do he disgrace hi own tribe he even brand it in the person of levi with perpetual infamy simeon say he and levi instrument of cruelty be in their habitation o my soul come notthou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be notthou united he certainly might have be silent on that disgraceful circumstance notonly to spare hi father but also to avoid asperse himself as well a all hi family with part of the same ignominy how can any suspicion be entertain of him who voluntarily publish from the inspiration of the holy spirit that the first of the family from which he be descend be guilty of detestable conduct neither consult hi own personal honour nor refuse to incur the resentment of hi relation to whom this must undoubtedly have give offence when he mention also the impious murmuring of aaron hi brother and miriam hi sister shall we say that he spake accord to the dictate of the flesh or obey the command of the holy spirit besides a he enjoy the supreme authority why do he notleave to hi own son at least the office of the highpriesthood but place them in the low station i only hint at a few thing out of many but in the law itself many argument will every where occur which challenge a full belief that without controversy the legation of moses be truly divine moreover the miracle which he relate and which be so numerous and remarkable be so many confirmation of the law which he deliver and of the doctrine which he publish for that he be carry up into the mountain in a cloud that he continue there forty day deprive of all human intercourse that in the act of proclaim the law hi face shone a with the ray of the sun that lightnings flash all around that thunder and various noise be hear through the whole atmosphere that a trumpet sound but a trumpet notblow by human breath that the entrance of the tabernacle be conceal from the view of the people by an intervening cloud that hi authority be so miraculously vindicate by the horrible destruction of korah dathan and abiram and all their impious faction that a rock smitten with a rod immediately emit a river that manna rain from heaven at hi requestare notall these so many testimony from heaven of hi be a true prophet if any one object that i assume a grant thing which be the subject of controversy this cavil be easily answer for a moses publish all these thing in an assembly of the people what room be there for fiction among those who have be eyewitness of the event be it probable that he would make hi appearance in public and accuse the people of infidelity contumacy ingratitude and other crime boast that hi doctrine have be confirm in their sight by miracle which they have never see for this also be worthy of be remark that all hi account of miracle be connect with such unpleasant circumstance a be calculate to stimulate all the people if there have be but the small occasion to a public and positive contradiction whence it appear that they be induce to coincide with him only by the ample conviction of their own experience but since the matter be too evident for profane writer to take the liberty of deny the performance of miracle by moses the father of lie have suggest the calumny of ascribe them to magical art but by what kind of conjecture can they pretend to charge him with have be a magician who have so great an abhorrence of that superstition a to command that he who merely consult magician and soothsayer should be stone certainly no impostor practise such juggling trick who do notmake it hi study for the sake of acquire fame to astonish the mind of the vulgar but what be the practice of moses openly avow that himself and hi brother aaron be nothing but that they only execute the command of god he sufficiently clear hi character from every unfavourable aspersion now if the event themselves be consider what incantation could cause manna to rain daily from heaven sufficient to support the people and if any one laid up more than the proper quantity cause it to putrefy a a punishment from god for hi unbelief add also the many serious examination which god permit hi servant to undergo so that the clamour of the wicked can now be of no avail for as often a this holy servant of god be in danger of be destroy at one time by proud and petulant insurrection of all the people at another by the secret conspiracy of a fewhow be it possible for him to elude their inveterate rage by any art of deception and the event evidently prove that by these circumstance hi doctrine be confirm to all succeed age moreover who can deny that hi assigning in the person of the patriarch jacob the supreme power to the tribe of judah proceed from a spirit of prophecy especially if we consider the eventual accomplishment of this prediction suppose moses to have be the first author of it yet after he commit it to write there elapse four hundred year in which we have no mention of the sceptre in the tribe of judah after the inauguration of saul the regal power seem to be fix in the tribe of benjamin when samuel anoint david what reason appear for transfer it who would have expect a king to arise out of the plebeian family of a herdsman and of seven brother who would have conjecture that such an honour be destine for the young and by what mean do he attain a hope of the kingdom who can assert that this unction be direct by human art or industry or prudence and be notrather a completion of the prediction of heaven and in like manner do nothi prediction although obscure concern the admission of the gentile into the covenant of god which be accomplish almost two thousand year after clearly prove him to have speak under a divine inspiration i omit other prediction which so strongly savour of a divine inspiration that all who have the use of their reason must perceive that it be god who speak in short one song of hi be a clear mirror in which god evidently appear but in the other prophet this be yet far more conspicuous i shall only select a few example for to collect all would be too laborious when in the time of isaiah the kingdom of judah be in peace and even when they think themselves safe in the alliance of the chaldean isaiah publicly spake of the destruction of the city and the banishment of the people now even if to predict long before thing which then seem false but have since appear to be true be nota sufficiently clear proof of a divine inspiration to whom but god shall we ascribe the prophecy which he utter concern their deliverance he mention the name of cyrus by whom the chaldean be to be subdue and the people restore to liberty more than a century elapse after this prophecy before the birth of cyrus for he be notbear till about the hundredth year after the prophet death no man could then divine that there would be one cyrus who would engage in a war with the babylonian who would subjugate such a powerful monarchy and release the people of israel from exile do notthis bare narration without any ornament of diction plainly demonstrate that isaiah deliver the undoubted oracle of god and notthe conjecture of men again when jeremiah just before the people be carry away limit the duration of their captivity to seventy year and predict their liberation and return must nothi tongue have be under the direction of the spirit of god what impudence must it be to deny that the authority of the prophet have be confirm by such proof or that what they themselves assert in order to vindicate the credit due to their declaration have be actually fulfil behold the former thing be come to pass and new thing do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them i shall notspeak of jeremiah and ezekiel who live in distant country but prophesy at the same time so exactly accord in their declaration a though they have mutually dictate the word to each other what shall we say of daniel ha nothe prophesy of the event of nearly six hundred year in such a connected series a if he be compose a history of transaction already past and universally know if pious men properly consider these thing they will be sufficiently prepare to curb the petulance of the wicked for the demonstration be too clear to be liable to any cavil i know what be object by some clamorous men who would ostentatiously display the force of their understanding in oppose divine truth for they inquire who have assure u that moses and the prophet actually write those book which bear their name they even dare to question whether such a man a moses ever exist but if any man should call in question the existence of plato or aristotle or cicero who would deny that such madness ought to receive corporal punishment the law of moses have be wonderfully preserve rather by the providence of heaven than by the endeavour of men and though through the negligence of the priest it lay for a short time conceal since it be find by the pious king josiah it have continue in the hand of men through every succeeding age nor indeed do josiah produce it a a thing unknown or new but a what have always be public and the memory of which be then famous the protograph have be appoint to be keep in the temple and a transcript of it to be deposit in the royal archive only the priest have discontinue their ancient custom of publish the law and the people themselves have neglect their wonted reading of it yet there scarcely pass an age in which it sanction be notconfirm and renew were they who have the writing of david ignorant of moses but to speak of all at once it be certain that their writing descend to posterity only from hand to hand so to speak through a long series of year transmit from the father who partly have hear them speak and partly learn from other who hear them while it be fresh in their memory that they have thus speak with regard to what they object from the history of the maccabees to diminish the credit of the scripture nothing could be conceive more adapted to establish it but first let u divest it of their artificial colouring and then retort upon them the weapon which they direct against u when antiochus say they command all the book to be burn whence proceed the copy which we now have i on the contrary inquire where they could so speedily be fabricate for it be evident that as soon a the persecution subside they immediately appear and be without controversy acknowledge a the same by all pious men who have be educate in their doctrine have be familiarly acquaint with them nay even when all the impious a if by a general conspiracy so wantonly insult the jew no man ever dare to charge them with forge their book for whatever be their opinion of the jewish religion yet they confess that moses be the author of it what then do these clamorous objector but betray their own consummate impudence when they slander a supposititious book whose sacred antiquity be confirm by the consent of all history but to waste no more useless labour in refute such stale calumny let u rather consider how carefully the lord preserve hi own word when beyond all hope he rescue it from the fury of the most cruel of tyrant a from a devour firethat he endue the pious priest and other with so much constancy that they hesitate notto redeem this treasure if necessary with their life to transmit it to posterity and that he frustrate the most diligent inquisition of so many governor and soldier who be there but must acknowledge it to have be an eminent and wonderful work of god that those sacred monument which the impious have flatter themselves be utterly destroy be soon public again a it be fully restore to mankind and indeed with far great honour for soon after follow the greek translation which publish them throughout the world nor be god preserve the table of hi covenant from the sanguinary edict of antiochus the only instance of hi wonderful operation but that amidst such various misery with which the jewish nation be diminish and lay waste and at last nearly exterminate these record still remain entire the hebrew language lay notonly despise but almost unknown and surely have notgod consult the interest of religion it have be totally lose for how much the jew after their return from captivity depart from the genuine use of their native language appear from the prophet of that age which it be therefore useful to observe because this comparison more clearly evince the antiquity of the law and the prophet and by whom hath god preserve to u the doctrine of salvation contain in the law and the prophet that christ might be manifest in due time by hi most inveterate enemy the jew whom augustine therefore justly denominate the librarian of the christian church because they have furnish u with a book of which themselves make no use if we proceed to the new testament by what solid foundation be it truth support three evangelist recite their history in a low and mean style many proud men be disgust with that simplicity because they attend notto the principal point of doctrine whence it be easy to infer that they treat of heavenly mystery which be above human capacity they who have a spark of ingenuous modesty will certainly be ashamed if they peruse the first of luke now the discourse of christ a concise summary of which be comprise in these three evangelist easily exempt their writing from contempt but john thunder from hi sublimity more powerfully than any thunderbolt level to the dust the obstinacy of those whom he do notcompel to the obedience of faith let all those censorious critic whose supreme pleasure consist in banish all reverence for the scripture out of their own heart and the heart of other come forth to public view let them read the gospel of john whether they wish it or notthey will there find numerous passage which at least arouse their indolence and which will even imprint a horrible brand on their conscience to restrain their ridicule similar be the method of paul and of peter in whose writing though the great part be blind yet their heavenly majesty attract universal attention but this one circumstance raise their doctrine sufficiently above the world that matthew who have before be confine to the profit of hi table and peter and john who have be employ in fishingboatsall plain unlettered menhad learn nothing in any human school which they could communicate to other and paul from notonly a profess but a cruel and sanguinary enemy be convert to a new man prove by hi sudden and unhoped for change that he be constrain by a command from heaven to vindicate that doctrine which he have before oppose let these men deny that the holy spirit descend on the apostle or at least let them dispute the credibility of the history yet the fact itself loudly proclaim that they be teach by the spirit who though before despise a some of the mean of the people suddenly begin to discourse in such a magnificent manner on the mystery of heaven besides there be also other very substantial reason why the consent of the church should have it weight for it be notan unimportant consideration that since the publication of the scripture so many generation of men should have agree in voluntarily obey it and that however satan together with the whole world have endeavour by strange method to suppress or destroy it or utterly to erase and obliterate it from the memory of man yet it have always like a palmtree risen superior to all opposition and remain invincible indeed there have scarcely ever be a sophist or orator of more than common ability who have nottry hi strength in oppose it yet they have all avail nothing all the power of the earth have arm themselves for it destruction but their attempt have all evaporate into smoke how could it have so firmly resisted attack on every quarter if it have be support only by human power indeed an additional proof of it divine origin arise from this very circumstance that notwithstanding all the strenuous resistance of men it have by it own power risen superior to every danger moreover notone city or one nation only have conspire to receive and embrace it but as far a the world extend it have obtain it authority by the holy consent of various nation who agree in nothing besides and a such an agreement of mind so widely distant in place and so completely dissimilar in manner and opinion ought to have great influence with u since it be plain that it be effect only by the power of heaven so it acquire no small weight from a consideration of the piety of those who unite in this agreement notindeed of all but of those who it hath pleased the lord should shine a luminary in hi church now with what unlimited confidence should we submit to that doctrine which we see confirmed and witness by the blood of so many saint have once receive it they hesitate notwith intrepid boldness and even with great alacrity to die in it defence transmit to u with such a pledge how should we notreceive it with a firm and unshaken conviction be it therefore no small confirmation of the scripture that it have be seal with the blood of so many martyr especially when we consider that they die to bear testimony to their faith notthrough intemperate fanaticism a be sometimes the case with men of erroneous mind but through a firm and constant yet sober zeal for god there be other reason and those neither few nor weak by which the native dignity and authority of the scripture be notonly maintain in the mind of the pious but also completely vindicate against the subtlety of calumniators but such a alone be notsufficient to produce firm faith in it till the heavenly father discover hi own power therein place it authority beyond all controversy wherefore the scripture will then only be effectual to produce the save knowledge of god when the certainty of it shall be found on the internal persuasion of the holy spirit thus those human testimony which contribute to it confirmation will notbe useless if they follow that first and principal proof a secondary aid to our imbecility but those person betray great folly who wish it to be demonstrate to infidels that the scripture be the word of god which can notbe know without faith augustine therefore justly observe that piety and peace of mind ought to precede in order that a man may understand somewhat of such great subject the fanaticism which discard the scripture under the pretence of resort to immediate revelation subversive of every principle of piety person who abandon the scripture imagine to themselves some other way of approach to god must be consider a notso much mislead by error a actuate by frenzy for there have lately arise some unsteady men who haughtily pretend to be teach by the spirit reject all reading themselves and deride the simplicity of those who still attend to what they style the dead and killing letter but i would ask them what spirit that be by whose inspiration they be elevate to such a sublimity a to dare to despise the doctrine of the scripture a puerile and mean for if they answer that it be the spirit of christ how ridiculous be such an assurance for that the apostle of christ and other believer in the primitive church be illuminate by no other spirit i think they will concede but notone of them learn from hi teach to contemn the divine word they be rather fill with high reverence for it a their writing abundantly testify this have be predict by the mouth of isaiah for where he say my spirit that be upon thee and my word which i have put in thy mouth shall notdepart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed for ever he do notconfine people under the old dispensation to the external letter a though they be child learn to read but declare that it will be the true and complete felicity of the new church under the reign of christ to be govern by the word of god as well a by hi spirit whence we infer that these person be guilty of detestable sacrilege in disjoin these two thing which the prophet have connect in an inviolable union again paul after he have be catch up into the third heaven do notcease to study the doctrine of the law and the prophet a he also exhort timothy a teacher of more than common excellence to give attendance to reading and worthy of remembrance be hi eulogium on the scripture that it be profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect how diabolical then be that madness which pretend that the use of the scripture be only transient and temporary which guide the son of god to the high point of perfection i would also ask them another questionwhether they have imbibe a different spirit from that which the lord promise to hi disciple great a their infatuation be i do notthink them fanatical enough to hazard such an avowal but what kind of spirit do he promise one truly who should notspeak of himself but suggest and instil into their mind those thing which he have orally deliver the office of the spirit then which be promise to u be notto feign new and unheard of revelation or to coin a new system of doctrine which would seduce u from the received doctrine of the gospel but to seal to our mind the same doctrine which the gospel delivers hence we readily understand that it be incumbent on u diligently to read and attend to the scripture if we would receive any advantage or satisfaction from the spirit of god thus also peter commends those who studiously attend to the doctrine of the prophet which yet might be suppose to have retire after the light of the gospel be rise but on the contrary that if any spirit neglect the wisdom of the word of god obtrude on u another doctrine he ought justly to be suspect of vanity and falsehood for a satan transform himself into an angel of light what authority will the spirit have with u unless we can distinguish him by the most certain criterion we find him clearly designate indeed in the word of the lord but these unhappy men be fondly bent on delusion even to their own destruction seek a spirit rather from themselves than from him but they plead that it be unworthy of the spirit of god to whom all thing ought to be subject to be make subject to the scripture a though it be ignominious to the holy spirit to be every where equal and uniform in all thing invariably consistent with himself if he be to be conform to the rule of men or of angel or of any other being i grant he might then be consider a degrade or even reduce to a state of servitude but while he be compare with himself and consider in himself who will assert that he be thereby injure this be bring him to the test of examination i confess it be but it be the way which he have choose for the confirmation of hi majesty among u we ought to be satisfy as soon a he communicate himself to u but l the spirit of satan should insinuate himself under hi name he choose to be recognize by u from hi image which he hath impress in the scripture he be the author of the scripture he can notbe mutable and inconsistent with himself he must therefore perpetually remain such a he have there discover himself to be this be notdisgraceful to him unless we esteem it honourable for him to alter and degenerate from himself but their cavilling objection that we depend on the letter that killeth show that they have notescape the punishment due to the despisers of the scripture for it be sufficiently evident that paul be there contend against the false apostle who recommend the law to the exclusion of christ be seduce the people from the blessing of the new covenant in which the lord engage to engrave hi law in the mind of believer and to inscribe it on their heart the letter therefore be dead and the law of the lord slay the reader of it where it be separate from the grace of christ and only sound in the ear without affect the heart but if it be efficaciously impress on our heart by the spiritif it exhibit christit be the word of life convert the soul make wise the simple c but in the same place the apostle also call hi preach the ministration of the spirit doubtless intend that the holy spirit so adhere to hi own truth which he hath express in the scripture that he only display and exert hi power where the word be receive with due reverence and honour nor be this repugnant to what i before assert that the word itself have notmuch certainty with u unless when confirm by the testimony of the spirit for the lord hath establish a kind of mutual connection between the certainty of hi word and of hi spirit so that our mind be fill with a solid reverence for the word when by the light of the spirit we be enable therein to behold the divine countenance and on the other hand without the least fear of mistake we gladly receive the spirit when we recognize him in hi image that be in the word this be the true state of the case god do notpublish hi word to mankind for the sake of momentary ostentation with a design to destroy or annul it immediately on the advent of the spirit but he afterwards send the same spirit by whose agency he have dispense hi word to complete hi work by an efficacious confirmation of that word in this manner christ open the understanding of hi two disciple notthat reject the scripture they might be wise enough of themselves but that they might understand the scripture so when paul exhort the thessalonian to quench notthe spirit he do notlead them to empty speculation independent of the word for he immediately add despise notprophesy clearly intimate that the light of the spirit be extinguish when prophecy fall into contempt what answer can be give to these thing by those proud fanatic who think themselves possess of the only valuable illumination when securely neglect and forsake the divine word they with equal confidence and temerity greedily embrace every reverie which their distempered imagination may have conceive a very different sobriety become the child of god who while they be sensible that exclusively of the spirit of god they be utterly destitute of the light of truth yet be notignorant that the word be the instrument by which the lord dispense to believers the illumination of hi spirit for they know no other spirit than that who dwell in and spake by the apostle by whose oracle they be continually call to the hearing of the word all idolatrous worship discountenanced in the scripture by it exclusive opposition of the true god to all the fictitious deity of the heathen but since we have show that the knowledge of god which be otherwise exhibit without obscurity in the structure of the world and in all the creature be yet more familiarly and clearly unfold in the word it will be useful to examine whether the representation which the lord give u of himself in the scripture agree with the portraiture which he have before be please to delineate in hi work this be indeed an extensive subject if we intend to dwell on a particular discussion of it but i shall content myself with suggest some hint by which the mind of the pious may learn what ought to be their principal object of investigation in scripture concern god and may be direct to a certain end in that inquiry i do notyet allude to the peculiar covenant which distinguish the descendant of abraham from the rest of the nation for in receiving by gratuitous adoption those who be hi enemy into the number of hi child god even then manifest himself a a redeemer but we be still treat of that knowledge which relate to the creation of the world without ascend to christ the mediator but though it will be useful soon to cite some passage from the new testament since that also demonstrate the power of god in the creation and hi providence in the conservation of the world yet i wish the reader to be apprize of the point now intend to be discuss that he may notpass the limit which the subject prescribes at present then let it suffice to understand how god the former of heaven and earth governs the world which he hath make both hi paternal goodness and the beneficent inclination of hi will be every where celebrate and example be give of hi severity which discover him to be the righteous punish of iniquity especially where hi forbearance produce no salutary effect upon the obstinate in some place indeed we be favour with more explicit description which exhibit to our view an exact representation of hi genuine countenance for moses in the description which he give of it certainly appear to have intend a brief comprehension of all that it be possible for men to know concern himthe lord the lord god merciful and gracious long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keep mercy for thousand forgive iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no mean clear the guilty visit the iniquity of the father upon the child and upon the children child where we may observe first the assertion of hi eternity and selfexistence in that magnificent name which be twice repeat and secondly the celebration of hi attribute give u a description notof what he be in himself but of what he be to u that our knowledge of him may consist rather in a lively perception than in vain and airy speculation here we find an enumeration of the same perfection which a we have remark be illustriously display both in heaven and on earthclemency goodness mercy justice judgment and truth for power be comprise in the word elohim god the prophet distinguish him by the same epithet when they intend a complete exhibition of hi holy name but to avoid the necessity of quote many passage let u content ourselves at present with refer to one psalm which contain such an accurate summary of all hi perfection that nothing seem to be omit and yet it contain nothing but what may be know from a contemplation of the creature thus by the teaching of experience we perceive god to be just what he declare himself in hi word in jeremiah where he announce in what character he will be know by u he give a description notso full but to the same effectlet him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i be the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth these three thing it be certainly of the high importance for u to knowmercy in which alone consist all our salvation judgment which be execute on the wicked every day and await them in a still heavy degree to eternal destruction righteousness by which the faithful be preserve and most graciously support when you understand these thing the prophecy declare that you have abundant reason for glory in god nor be this representation chargeable with an omission of hi truth or hi power or hi holiness or hi goodness for how could we have that knowledge which be here require of hi righteousness mercy and judgment unless it be support by hi inflexible veracity and how could we believe that he govern the world in judgment and justice if we be ignorant of hi power and whence proceeds hi mercy but from hi goodness if all hi way then be mercy judgment and righteousness holiness also must be conspicuously display in them moreover the knowledge of god which be afford u in the scripture be design for the same end a that which we derive from the creature it invite u first to the fear of god and then to confidence in him that we may learn to honour him with perfect innocence of life and sincere obedience to hi will and to place all our dependence on hi goodness but here i intend to comprise a summary of the general doctrine and first let the reader observe that the scripture in order to direct u to the true god expressly exclude and reject all the god of the heathen because in almost all age religion have be generally corrupt it be true indeed that the name of one supreme god have be universally know and celebrate for those who use to worship a multitude of deity whenever they spake accord to the genuine sense of nature use simply the name of god in the singular number a though they be content with one god and this be wisely remark by justin martyr who for this purpose write a book on the monarchy of god in which he demonstrate from numerous testimony that the unity of god be a principle universally impress on the heart of men tertullian also prove the same point from the common phraseology but since all men without exception have by their own vanity be draw into erroneous notion and so their understanding have become vain all their natural perception of the divine unity have only serve to render them inexcusable for even the wise of them evidently betray the vagrant uncertainty of their mind when they wish for some god to assist them and in their vow call upon unknown and fabulous deity besides in imagine the existence of many nature in god though they do notentertain such absurd notion a the ignorant vulgar concern jupiter mercury venus minerva and the rest they be themselves by no mean exempt from the delusion of satan and a we have already remark whatever subterfuge their ingenuity have invent none of the philosopher can exculpate themselves from the crime of revolt from god by the corruption of hi truth for this reason habakkuk after condemn all idol bid u to seek the lord in hi holy temple that the faithful might acknowledge no other god than jehovah who have reveal himself in hi word unlawfulness of ascribing to god a visible form all idolatry a defection from the true god now a the scripture in consideration of the ignorance and dulness of the human understanding generally speak in the plain mannerwhere it intend to discriminate between the true god and all false god it principally contrast him with idol notthat it may sanction the more ingenious and plausible system of the philosopher but that it may well detect the folly and even madness of the world in research concern god as long a every one adhere to hi own speculation that exclusive definition therefore which every where occur reduces to nothing whatever notion of the deity men may form in their own imagination since god alone be a sufficient witness concern himself in the mean time since the whole world have be seize with such brutal stupidity a to be desirous of visible representation of the deity and thus to fabricate god of wood stone gold silver and other inanimate and corruptible material we ought to hold this a a certain principle that whenever any image be make a a representation of god the divine glory be corrupt by an impious falsehood therefore god in the law after have assert the glory of deity to belong exclusively to himself when he intend to show what worship he approve or reject immediately add thou shalt notmake unto thee any graven image or any likeness in these word he forbid u to attempt a representation of him in any visible figure and briefly enumerate all the form by which superstition have already begin to change hi truth into a lie for the persian we know worship the sun and the foolish heathen make for themselves a many god a they saw star in the heaven there be scarcely an animal indeed which the egyptian do notconsider a an image of god the greek appear wise than the rest because they worship the deity under the human form but god compare notidols with each other a though one be good or bad than another but reject without a single exception all statue picture and other figure in which idolater imagine that he would be near them this it be easy to infer from the reason which he annex to the prohibition first in the writing of moses take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire ye hear the voice of the word but saw no similitude l ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure c we see how expressly god oppose hi voice to every manner of similitude to show that whoever desire visible representation of him be guilty of depart from him it will be sufficient to refer to one of the prophet isaiah who insist more than all the other on this argument that the divine majesty be dishonour by mean and absurd fiction when he that be incorporeal be liken to a corporeal form he that be invisible to a visible image he that be a spirit to inanimate matter and he that fill immensity to a log of wood a small stone or a lump of gold paul also reason in the same manner forasmuch then a we be the offspring of god we ought notto think that the godhead be like unto gold or silver or stone grave by art and man device whence it follow that whatever statue be erect or image paint to represent god they be only displease to him a be so many insult to the divine majesty and why should we wonder at the holy spirit thunder forth such oracle from heaven since he compel the blind and wretched idolater to make a similar confession on earth well know be the complaint of seneca which be cite by augustine they dedicate say he the vile and mean material to represent the sacred immortal and inviolable god and give them some a human form and some a brutal one and some a double sex and different body and they confer the name of god upon image which if animate would be account monster hence it further appear that the pretence set up by the advocate for idol that they be forbid to the jew because they be prone to superstition be only a frivolous cavil to evade the force of the argument a if truly that be peculiarly applicable to one nation which god deduce from hi eternal existence and the invariable order of nature besides paul be notaddress the jew but the athenian when he refute the error of make any similitude of god sometimes indeed god hath discover hi presence by certain sign so that he be say to be see face to face but all the sign which he ever adopt be well calculate for the instruction of men and afford clear intimation of hi incomprehensible essence for the cloud and the smoke and the flame though they be symbol of celestial glory nevertheless operate a a restraint on the mind of all to prevent their attempt to penetrate any further wherefore even moses to whom he manifest himself more familiarly than to any other obtain notby hi prayer a sight of the face of god but receive this answer thou canst notsee my face for there shall no man see my face and live the holy spirit once appear in the form of a dove but a he presently disappear again who do notperceive that by this momentary symbol the faithful be teach that they should believe the spirit to be invisible that be content with hi power and grace they might make no external representation of him the appearance of god in the human form be prelude to hi future manifestation in christ therefore the jew be notpermit to make this a pretext for erect a symbol of deity in the figure of a man the mercy seat also from which under the law god display the presence of hi power be so constructed a to suggest that the best contemplation of the divine being be when the mind be transport beyond itself with admiration for the cherub cover it with their extended wing the veil be spread before it and the place itself be sufficiently conceal by it secluded situation it be manifestly unreasonable therefore to endeavour to defend image of god and of the saint by the example of those cherub for pray what be signify by those little image but that image be notcalculate to represent the divine mystery since they be form in such a manner a by veil the mercy seat with their wing to prevent notonly the eye but all the human sens from pry into god and so to restrain all temerity moreover the prophet describe the seraph whom he saw in a vision a have their face cover to signify that the splendour of the divine glory be so great that even the angel themselves can notsteadfastly behold it and the faint spark of it which shine in the angel be conceal from our view the cherub however of which we be now speak be acknowledge by all person of sound judgment to have be peculiar to the old state of tutelage under the legal dispensation to adduce them therefore a example for the imitation of the present age be quite absurd for that puerile period a i may call it for which such rudiment be appoint be now past and indeed it be a shameful consideration that heathen writer be more expert interpreter of the divine law than the papist juvenal reproach and ridicule the jew for worship the white cloud and deity of heaven this language indeed be perverse and impious but in deny that there be any image of god among them he speak with more truth than the papist who idly pretend that there be some visible figure of him but a that nation frequently break out into idolatry with great and sudden impetuosity resemble the violent ebullition of water from a large spring hence let u learn the strong propensity of the human mind to idolatry l impute to the jew a crime common to all we should be fascinate by the allurement of sin and sleep the sleep of death to the same purpose be that passage the idol of the heathen be silver and gold the work of men hand for the prophet conclude from the very material that they be no god whose image be make of gold or of silver and take it for grant that every conception we form of the deity merely from our own understanding be a foolish imagination he mention gold and silver rather than clay or stone that the splendour or the value of the material may procure no reverence for the idol but he conclude in general that nothing be more improbable than that god should be manufacture from any inanimate matter at the same time he insist equally on another pointthat it be presumption and madness in mortal men who be every moment in danger of lose the fleeting breath which they draw to dare to confer upon idol the honour due to god man be constrain to confess that he be a creature of a day and yet he will have a piece of metal to be worship a a god of the deity of which he be the author for whence do idols originate but in the will of men there be much propriety in that sarcasm of a heathen poet who represent one of their idol a say formerly i be the trunk of a wild figtree a useless log when the artificer after hesitate whether he would make me a stool or a deity at length determine that i should be a god a poor mortal forsooth who be a it be expire almost every moment will by hi workmanship transfer to a dead stock the name and honour of god but a that epicurean in hi satirical effusion have pay no respect to any religionleaving this sarcasm and other of the same kind we should be sting and penetrate by the rebuke which the prophet have give to the extreme stupidity of those who with the same wood make a fire to warm themselves heat an oven for bake bread roast or boil their meat and fabricate a god before which they prostrate themselves to address their humble supplication in another place therefore he notonly pronounce them transgressor of the law but reproach them for nothave learn from the foundation of the earth since in reality there be nothing more unreasonable than the thought of contract the infinite and incomprehensible god within the compass of five foot and yet this monstrous abomination which be manifestly repugnant to the order of nature experience demonstrate to be natural to man it must be far observed that idol be frequently stigmatize a be the work of men hand unsanctioned by divine authority in order to establish this principle that all mode of worship which be merely of human invention be detestable the psalmist aggravate this madness forasmuch a men implore the aid of dead and insensible thing who be imbue with understand to know that all thing be direct solely by the power of god but since the corruption of nature carry all nation in general and each individual in particular to such an excess of frenzy the spirit at length thunder out this direful imprecation let those that make them be like unto them and every one that trusteth in them let it be observe that all similitude be equally as much forbidden a graven image which refute the foolish subterfuge of the greek for they think themselves quite safe if they make no sculpture of deity while in picture they indulge great liberty than any other nation but the lord prohibit every representation of him whether make by the statuary or by any other artificer because all similitude be criminal and insult to the divine majesty i know that it be a very common observation that image be the book of the illiterate gregory say so but very different be the decision of the spirit of god in whose school have gregory be taught he would never have make such an assertion for since jeremiah pronounces that the stock be a doctrine of vanity since habakkuk represent a molten image a a teacher of liescertainly the general doctrine to be gather from these passage be that whatever men learn respect god from image be equally frivolous and false if any one object that the prophet only reprehend those who abuse image to the impious purpose of superstitionthat indeed i grant but affirm also what be evident to every one that they utterly condemn what be assume by the papist a an indubitable axiom that image be substitute for book for they contrast image with the true god a contrary which can never agree this comparison i say be lay down in those passage which i have just cite that since there be only one true god whom the jew worship there can be no visible figure make to serve a representation of the divine being without falsehood and criminality and all who seek the knowledge of god from such figure be under a miserable delusion be it nottrue that all knowledge of god seek from image be corrupt and fallacious it would notbe so uniformly condemn by the prophet this at least must be grant to u that when we maintain the vanity and fallaciousness of the attempt of men to make visible representation of god we do no other than recite the express declaration of the prophet read likewise what have be write on this subject by lactantius and eusebius who hesitate notto assume a a certainty that all those whose image be to be see be mortal men augustine also confidently assert the unlawfulness notonly of worship image but even of erect any with reference to god nor do he advance any thing different from what have many year before be decree by the elibertine council the thirtysixth of which be a follow it hath be decree that no picture be have in the church and that what be worship or adore be notpaint on the wall but most remarkable be what augustine elsewhere cite from varro and to the truth of which he subscribesthat they who first introduce image of the god remove fear and add error if this have be a mere assertion of varro alone it might have perhaps but little authority yet it should justly fill u with shame that a heathen grope a it be in the dark attain so much light a to perceive that corporeal representation be unworthy of the divine majesty be calculate to diminish the fear of god and to increase error among mankind the fact itself demonstrate this to have be speak with equal truth and wisdom but augustine have borrow it from varro advance it a hi own opinion and first he observe that the most ancient error concern god in which men be involve do notoriginate from image but be increase by them a by the superaddition of new material he next explain that the fear of god be thereby diminish and even destroy since the foolish ridiculous and absurd fabrication of idol would easily bring hi divinity into contempt of the truth of this second remark i sincerely wish that we have notsuch proof in our own experience whoever therefore desire to be rightly instruct he must learn from some other quarter than from image what be to be know concern god if the papist have any shame let them no longer use this subterfuge that image be the book of the illiterate which be so clearly refute by numerous testimony from scripture yet though i should concede this point to them it would avail them but little in defence of their idol what monsters they obtrude in the place of deity be well know but what they call the picture or statue of their saintswhat be they but example of the most abandoned luxury and obscenity which if any one be desirous of imitate he would deserve corporal punishment even prostitute in brothel be to be see in more chaste and modest attire than those image in their temple which they wish to be account image of virgin nor do they clothe the martyr in habit at all more become let them adorn their idol then with some small degree of modesty that the pretence of their be book of some holiness if notless false may be less impudent but even then we will reply that this be notthe method to be adopt in sacred place for the instruction of the faithful whom god will have teach a very different doctrine from any that can be learn from such insignificant trifle he hath commanded one common doctrine to be there propose to all in the preaching of hi word and in hi sacred mystery to which they betray great inattention of mind who be carry about by their eye to the contemplation of idol whom then do the papist call illiterate whose ignorance will suffer them to be teach only by image those truly whom the lord acknowledge a hi disciple whom he honour with the revelation of hi heavenly philosophy whom he will have instruct in the healthful mystery of hi kingdom i confess indeed a thing be now circumstanced that there be at present nota few who can notbear to be deprive of such book but whence arises this stupidity but from be defraud of that teach which alone be adapt to their instruction in fact those who preside over the church resign to idols the office of teach for no other reason but because they be themselves dumb paul testifies that in the true preaching of this gospel christ be evidently set forth and a it be crucify before our eye to what purpose then be the erection of so many cross of wood and stone silver and gold every where in the temple if it have be fully and faithfully inculcate that christ die that he might bear our curse on the cross expiate our sin by the sacrifice of hi body cleanse u by hi blood and in a word reconcile u to god the father from this simple declaration they might learn more than from a thousand cross of wood or stone for perhaps the avaricious fix their mind and their eye more tenaciously on the gold and silver cross than on any part of the divine word respect the origin of idol the generally receive opinion agree with what be assert in the book of wisdom namely that the first author of them be person who pay this honour to the dead from a superstitious reverence for their memory i grant that this perverse custom be very ancient and deny notthat it greatly contribute to increase the rage of mankind after idolatry nevertheless i can notconcede that it be the first cause of that evil for it appear from moses that idol be in use long before the introduction of that ostentatious consecration of the image of the dead which be frequently mention by profane writer when he relate that rachel steal her father idols he speak a of a common corruption whence we may infer that the mind of man be if i may be allow the expression a perpetual manufactory of idol after the deluge there be a it be a regeneration of the world but notmany year elapse before men fabricate god accord to their own fancy and it be probable that while the holy patriarch be yet alive hi posterity be addict to idolatry so that with the bitter grief he might with hi own eye behold the earth which god have lately purge from it corruption by such a dreadful judgment again pollute with idol for terah and nachor before the birth of abraham be worshipper of false god a be assert by joshua since the posterity of shem so speedily degenerate what opinion must we entertain of the descendant of ham who have already be curse in their father the true state of the case be that the mind of man be full of pride and temerity dare to conceive of god accord to it own standard and be sink in stupidity and immerse in profound ignorance imago a vain and ridiculous phantom instead of god these evil be follow by another men attempt to express in the work of their hand such a deity a they have imagine in their mind the mind then beget the idol and the hand bring it forth the example of the israelite prove this to have be the origin of idolatry namely that men believe notgod to be among them unless he exhibit some external sign of hi presence a for this moses they say we wot notwhat be become of him make u god which shall go before u they know indeed that there be a god whose power they have experience in so many miracle but they have no confidence in hi be present with them unless they could see some corporeal symbol of hi countenance a a testimony of their divine guide they wish therefore to understand from the image go before them that god be the leader of their march daily experience teach that the flesh be never satisfy till it have obtain some image resemble itself in which it may be foolishly gratify a an image of god in almost all age from the creation of the world in obedience to this stupid propensity men have erect visible representation in which they believe god to be present to their carnal eye such an invention be immediately attend with adoration for when men suppose that they saw god in image they also worship him in them at length both their eye and their mind be wholly confine to them they begin to grow more stupid and to admire them a though they possess some inherent divinity now it be plain that men do notrush into the worship of image till they have imbibe some very gross opinion respect them notindeed that they believe them to be god but they imagine that something of divinity reside in them when you prostrate yourself therefore in adoration of an image whether you suppose it to represent god or a creature you be already fascinate with superstition for this reason the lord hath prohibit notonly the erection of statue make a representation of him but also the consecration of any inscription or monument to stand a object of worship for the same reason also another point be annex to the precept in the law concern adoration for as soon a men have make a visible figure of god they attach divine power to it such be the stupidity of men that they confine god to any image which they make to represent him and therefore can notbut worship it nor be it of any importance whether they worship simply the idol or god in the idol it be always idolatry when divine honour be pay to an idol under any pretence whatsoever and a god will notbe worship in a superstitious or idolatrous manner whatever be confer on idol be take from him let this be consider by those who seek such miserable pretext for the defence of that execrable idolatry with which for many age true religion have be overwhelm and subvert the image they say be notconsider a god neither be the jew so thoughtless a notto remember that it be god by whose hand they have be conduct out of egypt before they make the calf but when aaron say that those be the god by whom they have be liberate from egypt they boldly assent signify doubtless that they would keep in remembrance that god himself be their deliverer while they could see him go before them in the calf nor can we believe the heathen to have be so stupid a to conceive that god be no other than wood and stone for they change the image at pleasure but always retain in their mind the same god and there be many image for one god nor do they imagine to themselves god in proportion to the multitude of image besides they daily consecrate new image but without suppose that they make new god read the excuse which augustine say be allege by the idolater of the age in which he live when they be charge with idolatry the vulgar reply that they worship notthe visible figure but the divinity that invisibly dwell in it but they whose religion be a he express himself more refine say that they worship neither the image nor the spirit represent by it but that in the corporeal figure they behold a sign of that which they ought to worship what be to be infer from this but that all idolater whether jewish or gentile have be guide by the notion which i have mention notcontent with a spiritual knowledge of god they think that they should receive more clear and familiar impression of him by mean of image after they have once pleased themselves with such a preposterous representation of god they cease notfrom be delude with new fallacy till they imagine that god display hi power in image nevertheless the jew be persuade that under such image they worship the eternal god the one true lord of heaven and earth and the heathen that they worship their false god whom they pretend to be inhabitant of heaven those who deny that this have be do in time past and even within our own remembrance assert an impudent falsehood for why do they prostrate themselves before image and when about to pray why do they turn themselves towards them a towards the ear of god for it be true a augustine say that no man pray or worship thus look on an image who be notimpressed with an opinion that he shall be hear by it and a hope that it will do for him a he desire why be there so great a difference between image of the same god that one be pass by with little or no respect and another be honour in the most solemn manner why do they fatigue themselves with votive pilgrimage in go to see image resemble those which they have at home why do they at this day fight even to slaughter and destruction in defence of them a of their country and religion so that they could part with the only true god more easily than with their idol yet i be nothere enumerate the gross error of the vulgar which be almost infinite and occupy nearly the heart of all i only relate what they themselves allege when they be most anxious to exculpate themselves from idolatry we never say they call them our god nor do the jew or heathen in ancient time call them their god and yet the prophet in all their writing be constantly accuse them of fornication with wood and stone only on account of such thing a be daily practise by those who wish to be think christian that be for worship god by corporeal adoration before figure of wood or stone i be neither ignorant nor desirous of conceal that they evade the charge by a more subtle distinction which will soon be notice more at large they pretend that the reverence which they pay to image be eddea service of image but deny that it be edatea worship of image for in this manner they express themselves when they maintain that the reverence which they call dulia may be give to statue or picture without injury to god they consider themselves therefore liable to no blame while they be only the servant of their idol and notworshipper of them a though worship be notrather inferior to service and yet while they seek to shelter themselves under a greek term they contradict themselves in the most childish manner for since the greek word ate signifies nothing els but to worship what they say be equivalent to a confession that they adore their image but without adoration nor can they justly object that i be try to insnare them with word they betray their own ignorance in their endeavour to raise a mist before the eye of the simple but however eloquent they may be they will never be able by their rhetoric to prove one and the same thing to be two different thing let them point out i say a difference in fact that they may be account different from ancient idolater for a an adulterer or homicide will notescape the imputation of guilt by give hi crime a new and arbitrary name so it be absurd that these person should be exculpate by the subtle invention of a name if they really differ in no respect from those idolater whom they themselves be constrain to condemn but their case be so far from be different from that of former idolater that the source of all the evil be a preposterous emulation with which they have rival them by exercise their mind in contrive and their hand in form visible symbol of the deity nevertheless i be notso scrupulous a to think that no image ought ever to be permit but since sculpture and painting be gift of god i wish for a pure and legitimate use of both l those thing which the lord hath confer on u for hi glory and our benefit be notonly corrupt by preposterous abuse but even pervert to our ruin we think it unlawful to make any visible figure a a representation of god because he hath himself forbid it and it can notbe do without detract in some measure from hi glory let it notbe suppose that we be singular in this opinion for that all sound writer have uniformly reprobate the practice must be evident to person conversant with their work if then it be notlawful to make any corporeal representation of god much less will it be lawful to worship it for god or to worship god in it we conclude therefore that nothing should be paint and engrave but object visible to our eye the divine majesty which be far above the reach of human sight ought notto be corrupt by unseemly figure the subject of those art consist partly of history and transaction partly of image and corporeal form without reference to any transaction the former be of some use in information or recollection the latter as far a i see can furnish nothing but amusement and yet it be evident that almost all the image which have hitherto be set up in the church have be of this latter description hence it may be see that they be place there notwith judgment and discrimination but from a foolish and inconsiderate passion for them i say nothing here of the impropriety and indecency conspicuous in most of them and the wanton licentiousness display in them by the painter and statuary at which i have before hint i only assert that even if they be intrinsically faultless still they would be altogether unavailing for the purpose of instruction but passing over that difference also let u consider a we proceed whether it be expedient to have any image at all in christian temple either descriptive of historical event or representative of human form in the first place if the authority of the ancient church have any influence with u let u remember that for about five hundred year while religion continue in a more prosperous state and purer doctrine prevail the christian church be generally without image they be then first introduce therefore to ornament the church when the purity of the ministry have begin to degenerate i will notdispute what be the reason which influence the first author of them but if you compare one age with another you will see that they be much decline from the integrity of those who have no image who can suppose that those holy father would have permit the church to remain so long destitute of what they judge useful and salutary for it the fact be that instead of omit them through ignorance or negligence they perceive them to be of little or no use but on the contrary pregnant with much danger and therefore intentionally and wisely reject them this be assert in express term by augustine when they be fix say he in those place in an honourable elevation to attract the attention of those who be pray and sacrifice though they be destitute of sense and life yet by the very similitude of live member and sense they affect weak mind so that they appear to them to live and breathe c and in another place for that representation of member lead and a it be constrain the mind which animate a body to suppose that body to be endue with perception which it see to be very similar to it own c and a little after idol have more influence to bow down an unhappy soul because they have a mouth eyes ear and foot than to correct it because they neither speak nor see nor hear nor walk this indeed appear to be the reason of john exhortation to keep ourselves notonly from the worship of idol but from idols themselves and we have find it too true that through the horrible frenzy which almost to the total destruction of piety hath heretofore possess the world as soon a image be set up in church there be a it be a standard of idolatry erect for the folly of mankind can notrefrain from immediately fall into idolatrous worship but even if the danger be less yet when i consider the use for which temple be design it appear to me extremely unworthy of their sanctity to receive any other image than those natural and expressive one which the lord hath consecrate in hi word i mean baptism and the supper of the lord and the other ceremony with which our eye ought to be more attentively engage and more sensibly affect than to require any other form by human ingenuity behold the incomparable advantage of image the loss of which if you believe the papist nothing can compensate the remark already make on this subject i think would be sufficient if it be notnecessary to take some notice of the council of nice notthat very celebrate one which be convene by constantine the great but that which be hold about eight hundred year ago by the command and under the auspex of the empress irene for that council decree notonly that image should be have in church but also that they should be worship and notwithstanding what i have advance the authority of the council would raise a strong prejudice on the contrary side though to confess the truth i be notmuch concern at this a i be to show the reader their extreme madness whose fondness for image exceed any thing that be become in christian but let u despatch this point first the present advocate for the use of image allege the authority of that nicene council in their defence there be a book extant write in refutation of this practice under the name of charlemagne which from the diction we may conclude be compose at the same time in this work be recite the opinion of the bishop who attend the council and the argument they use in the controversy john the delegate of the eastern church say god create man in hi own image and hence he infer that we ought to have image the same prelate think that image be recommend to u by this sentence show me thy face for it be glorious another to prove that they ought to be place on the altar cite this testimony no man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a bushel another to show the contemplation of these to be useful to u adduce a verse from a psalm the light of thy countenance o lord be seal upon u another press this comparison into hi service a the patriarch use the sacrifice of the heathen so christian ought to have the image of saint instead of the idol of the heathen in the same manner they torture that expression lord i have love the beauty of thy house but the most ingenious of all be their interpretation of this passage a we have hear so have we see that therefore god be know notonly by the hearing of hi word but by the contemplation of image similar be the subtlety of bishop theodore god be glorious in hi saint and in another place it be say in the saint that be in the earth therefore this ought to be refer to image but their impertinencies and absurdity be so disgust that i be quite ashamed to repeat them when they dispute concern adoration they bring forward jacob worshipping of pharaoh and of the staff of joseph and of the inscription erect by himself although in this last instance they notonly corrupt the sense of the scripture but allege what be nowhere to be find these passage also worship hi footstool worship in hi holy hill and all the rich of the people shall supplicate thy face they consider a apposite and conclusive proof if any one wish to represent the advocate for image in a ridiculous point of view could he possibly ascribe to them great and gross instance of folly but that no doubt of this might remain theodosius bishop of mira defend the propriety of worship image from the dream of hi archdeacon as seriously a if he have an immediate revelation from heaven now let the advocate of image go and urge upon u the decree of that council a though those venerable father have notentirely destroy all their credit by such puerile treatment of the sacred scripture or such impious and shameful mutilation of them i come now to those prodigy of impiety which it be wonderful that they ever venture to broach and more wonderful still that they have notbe oppose with universal detestation it be right to expose this flagitious madness that the worship of image may at least be deprive of the pretence of antiquity which the papist falsely urge in it favour theodosius bishop of amorum denounces an anathema against all who be averse to the worship of image another impute all the calamity of greece and the east to the crime of nothave worship them what punishments then do the prophet apostle and martyr deserve in whose time image be unknown they add far if the image of the emperor be meet by procession with perfume and incense much more be this honour due to the image of the saint constantius bishop of constance in cyprus profess hi reverence for image and avow that he will pay them the same worship and honour a be due to the trinity the source of all life and whoever refuse to do the same he anathematize and dismiss with the manichee and marcionites and l you should suppose this to be the private opinion of an individual they all declare their assent to it john the delegate of the eastern church carry by the fervour of hi zeal to still great lengths assert it to be good to admit all the brothel of the world into one city than to reject the worship of image at length it be unanimously decree that the samaritan be bad than all heretic and that the adversary of image be bad than the samaritan but that the farce might notwant it usual plaudit they add this clause let them rejoice and exult who have the image of christ and offer sacrifice to it where be now the distinction of latria and dulia with which they attempt to deceive both god and men for the council give the same honour without any exception to image and to the living god god contradistinguished from idol that he may be solely and supremely worship we say at the beginning that the knowledge of god consist notin frigid speculation but be accompany by the worship of him we also cursorily touch on the right method of worship him which will be more fully explain in other place i now only repeat in few word that whenever the scripture assert that there be but one god it contend notfor the bare name but also teach that whatever belongs to the deity should notbe transfer to another this show how pure religion differs from idolatry the greek word eseea certainly signify right worship since even blind mortal grope in the dark have always perceive the necessity of some certain rule that the worship of god may notbe involve in disorder and confusion although cicero ingeniously and correctly derive the word religion from a verb signify to read over again or to gather again yet the reason he assign for it that good worshipper often recollect and diligently reconsider what be true be force and farfetched i rather think the word be oppose to a liberty of wander without restraint because the great part of the world rashly embrace whatever they meet with and also ramble from one thing to another but piety in order to walk with a steady step collect itself within it proper limit the word superstition also appear to me to import a discontent with the method and order prescribed and an accumulation of a superfluous mass of vain thing but to leave the consideration of word it have be generally admit in all age that religion be corrupt and pervert by error and falsehood whence we infer that when we allow ourselves any thing from inconsiderate zeal the pretext allege by the superstitious be altogether frivolous although this confession be in the mouth of all they betray at the same time a shameful ignorance neither adhere to the one true god nor observe any discrimination in hi worship a we have before show but god to assert hi own right proclaims that he be jealous and will be a severe avenger if men confound him with any fictitious deity and then to retain mankind in obedience he define hi legitimate worship he comprise both in hi law where he first bind the faithful to himself a their sole legislator and then prescribe a rule for the right worship of him accord to hi will now of the law since the us and end of it be various i shall treat in it proper place at present i only remark that it set up a barrier to prevent men turn aside to corrupt mode of worship let u remember what i have already state that unless every thing belong to divinity remain in god alone he be spoil of hi honour and hi worship be violate and here it be necessary to animadvert more particularly on the subtle fallacy of superstition for it revolt notto strange god in such a manner a to appear to desert the supreme god or to degrade him to a level with other but allow him the high place it surround him with a multitude of inferior deity among whom it distribute hi honour and thus in a cunning and hypocritical manner the glory of divinity be divide among many instead of remain wholly in one thus the ancient idolater jew as well a gentile imagine one god the father and governor of all and subordinate to him a vast multitude of other deity to whom in common with the supreme god they attribute the government of heaven and earth thus the saint who depart out of this life some age ago be exalt to the society of god to be worship and invoke and celebrate like him we suppose indeed the glory of god notto be sully with this abomination whereas it be in a great measure suppress and extinguish except that we retain some faint notion of hi supreme power but at the same time deceive with such imposture we be seduce to the worship of various deity on this account be invent the distinction of latria and dulia a they express themselves by which they conceive they might safely ascribe divine honour to angel and decease men for it be evident that the worship which papists pay to the saint differs notin reality from the worship of god for they adore god and them promiscuously but when they be accuse of it they evade the charge with this subterfuge that they preserve inviolate to god what belong to him because they leave him atea but since the question relate to a thing notto a word who can bear their careless trifle on the most important of all subject but to pass this also they will gain nothing at last by their distinction but that they render worship to god alone and service to the saint for atea in greek signifies the same a cultus in latin and worship in english but dea properly signifies servitus service and yet in the scripture this distinction be sometimes disregard but suppose it to be a constant distinction it remain to be inquire what be the meaning of each term atea be worship dea be service now no one doubt that to serve be more than to worship or honour for it would be irksome to serve many person whom you would notrefuse to honour so unjust be the distribution to assign the great to the saint and leave to god that which be less but many of the ancient it be urge have use this distinction what be that to the purpose if every one perceive it to be notonly improper but altogether frivolous leave these subtlety let u consider the subject itself paul when he remind the galatian what they have be before they be illuminate in the knowledge of god say that they do service to them which by nature be no god though he mention notatea worship be their idolatry therefore excusable he certainly condemn that perverse superstition which he denominate dea service equally as much a if he have use the word atea worship and when christ repel the assault of satan with this shield it be write thou shalt worship the lord thy god the word atea come notinto the question for satan require nothing but pss prostration or adoration so when john be reprehend by an angel for have fall on hi knee before him we must notunderstand that john be so stupid a to intend to transfer to an angel the honour due exclusively to god but since all worship that be connect with religion can notbut savour of divine he could notpse prostrate himself before the angel without detract from the glory of god we read indeed frequently of men have be worship but that be civil honour so to speak religion have a different design and no sooner be religion connect with worship or homage than it produce a profanation of the divine honour we may see the same in cornelius who have notmake such a small progress in piety a notto ascribe supreme worship to god alone when he fell down before peter therefore it certainly be notwith an intention of worship him instead of god yet peter positively forbid him to do it and why be this but because men never so particularly distinguish between the worship or homage of god and that of the creature a to avoid transfer to a creature what belong exclusively to god wherefore if we desire to have but one god let u remember that hi glory ought notin the least to be diminish but that he must retain all that belong to him therefore zechariah when speaking of the restoration of the church expressly declare notonly that there shall be one lord but also that hi name shall be one signify without doubt that he will have nothing in common with idol now what kind of worship god require will be see in due course in another place for he hath be please in hi law to prescribe to mankind what be lawful and right and so to confine them to a certain rule that every individual might nottake the liberty of invent a mode of worship accord to hi own fancy but since it be notproper to burden the reader by confound many subject together i shall notenter on that point yet let it suffice to know that no religious service can be transfer to any other than god alone without commit sacrilege at first indeed superstition ascribe divine honour either to the sun or to the other star or to idols afterwards follow ambition which adorn men with the spoil of god dare to profane every thing that be sacred and although there remain a persuasion that they ought to worship a supreme god yet it become customary to offer sacrifice promiscuously to gen and inferior deity and decease hero so steep be the descent to this vice to communicate to a vast multitude that which god particularly challenge to himself alone one divine essence containing three person taught in the scripture from the begin what be teach in the scripture concern the immensity and spirituality of the essence of god should serve notonly to overthrow the foolish notion of the vulgar but also to refute the subtlety of profane philosophy one of the ancient in hi own conception very shrewdly say that whatever we see and whatever we do notsee be god but he imagine that the deity be diffuse through every part of the world but although god to keep u within the bound of sobriety speaks but rarely of hi essence yet by those two attribute which i have mention he supersede all gross imagination and repress the presumption of the human mind for surely hi immensity ought to inspire u with awe that we may notattempt to measure him with our sens and the spirituality of hi nature prohibit u from entertain any earthly or carnal speculation concern him for the same reason he represent hi residence to be in heaven for though a he be incomprehensible he fill the earth also yet see that our mind from their dulness be continually dwell on the earth in order to shake off our sloth and inactivity he properly raise u above the world and here be demolish the error of the manichee who by maintain the existence of two original principle make the devil a it be equal to god this certainly be both divide the unity of god and limit hi immensity for their daring to abuse certain testimony of scripture betray a shameful ignorance a the error itself evidence an execrable madness the anthropomorphites also who imagine god to be corporeal because the scripture frequently ascribe to him a mouth ears eyes hand and foot be easily refute for who even of the mean capacity understand notthat god lisp a it be with u just a nurse be accustom to speak to infant wherefore such form of expression do notclearly explain the nature of god but accommodate the knowledge of him to our narrow capacity to accomplish which the scripture must necessarily descend far below the height of hi majesty but he also designate himself by another peculiar character by which he may be yet more clearly distinguish for while he declare himself to be but one he propose himself to be distinctly consider in three person without apprehend which we have only a bare and empty name of god float in our brain without any idea of the true god now that no one may vainly dream of three god or suppose that the simple essence of god be divide among the three person we must seek for a short and easy definition which will preserve u from all error but since some violently object to the word person a of human invention we must first examine the reasonableness of this objection when the apostle denominate the son the express image of the hypostasis of the father he undoubtedly ascribe to the father some subsistence in which he differ from the son for to understand this word a synonymous with essence a some interpreter have do a though christ like wax impress with a seal represent in himself the substance of the father be notonly harsh but also absurd for the essence of god be simple and indivisible he who contain all in himself notin part or by derivation but in complete perfection could notwithout impropriety and even absurdity be call the express image of it but since the father although distinguish by hi own peculiar property hath express himself entirely in hi son it be with the great reason assert that he hath make hi hypostasis conspicuous in him with which the other appellation give him in the same passage of the brightness of hi glory exactly correspond from the word of the apostle we certainly conclude that there be in the father a proper hypostasis which be conspicuous in the son and thence also we easily infer the hypostasis of the son which distinguish him from the father the same reasoning be applicable to the holy spirit for we shall soon prove him also to be god and yet he must of necessity be consider a distinct from the father but this be nota distinction of the essence which it be unlawful to represent a any other than simple and undivided it follow therefore if the testimony of the apostle be credit that there be in god three hypostasis and a the latin have express the same thing by the word person it be too fastidious and obstinate to contend about so clear a matter if we wish to translate word for word we may call it subsistence many in the same sense have call it substance nor have the word person be use by the latin only but the greek also for the sake of testify their consent to this doctrine teach the existence of three pspa person in god but both greek and latin notwithstanding any verbal difference be in perfect harmony respect the doctrine itself now though heretic rail at the word person or some morose and obstinate men clamorously refuse to admit a name of human invention since they can notmake u assert that there be three each of whom be entirely god nor yet that there be more god than one how very unreasonable be it to reprobate word which express nothing but what be testify and record in the scripture it be good say they to restrain notonly our thought but our expression also within the limit of the scripture than to introduce exotic word which may generate future dissension and dispute for thus we weary ourselves with verbal controversy thus the truth be lose in altercation thus charity expire in odious contention if they call every word exotic which can notbe find in the scripture in so many syllable they impose on u a law which be very unreasonable and which condemn all interpretation but what be compose of detached text of scripture connect together but if by exotic they mean that which be curiously contrive and superstitiously defend which tend to contention more than to edification the use of which be either unseasonable or unprofitable which offend pious ear with it harshness and seduces person from the simplicity of the divine word i most cordially embrace their modest opinion for i think that we ought to speak of god with the same religious caution which should govern our thought of him since all the thought that we entertain concern him merely from ourselves be foolish and all our expression absurd but there be a proper medium to be observe we should seek in the scripture a certain rule both for thinking and for speaking by which we may regulate all the thought of our mind and all the word of our mouth but what forbid our express in plainer word those thing which in the scripture be to our understanding intricate and obscure provide our expression religiously and faithfully convey the true sense of the scripture and be use with modest caution and notwithout sufficient occasion of this examples sufficiently numerous be notwant but when it shall have be prove that the church be absolutely necessitate to use the term trinity and person if any one then censure the novelty of the word may he notbe justly consider a offend at the light of the truth a have no other cause of censure but that the truth be explain and elucidate but such verbal novelty if it must have this appellation be principally use when the truth be to be assert in opposition to malicious caviller who elude it by crafty evasion of which we have too much experience in the present day who find great difficulty in refute the enemy of pure and sound doctrine possess of serpentine lubricity they escape by the most artful expedient unless they be vigorously pursue and hold fast when once catch thus the ancient pester with various controversy against erroneous dogma be constrain to express their sentiment with the utmost perspicuity that they might leave no subterfuge to the impious who avail themselves of obscure expression for the concealment of their error unable to resist the clear testimony of the scripture arius confess christ to be god and the son of god and a though this be all that be necessary he pretend to agree with the church at large but at the same time he continue to maintain that christ be create and have a beginning like other creature to draw the versatile subtlety of this man from it concealment the ancient father proceed far and declared christ to be the eternal son of the father and consubstantial with the father here impiety openly discover itself when the arians begin inveterately to hate and execrate the name s consubstantial but if in the first instance they have sincerely and cordially confessed christ to be god they would nothave deny him to be consubstantial with the father who can dare to censure those good men a quarrelsome and contentious for have kindle such a flame of controversy and disturb the peace of the church on account of one little word that little word distinguish christian who hold the pure faith from sacrilegious arians afterwards arose sabellius who consider the name of father son and holy spirit a little more than empty sound argue that they be notuse on account of any real distinction but be different attribute of god whose attribute of this kind be numerous if the point come to be controvert he confess that he believe the father to be god the son god and the holy spirit god but he would readily evade all the force of this confession by add that he have say no other than if he have call god potent and just and wise and thus he come to another conclusion that the father be the son and that the holy spirit be the father without any order or distinction the good doctor of that age who have the interest of religion at heart in order to counteract the wickedness of this man maintain on the contrary that they ought really to acknowledge three peculiar property in one god and to defend themselves against hi intricate subtlety by the plain and simple truth they affirm that they truly subsist in the one god or what be the same that in the unity of god there subsist a trinity of person if then the word have notbe rashly invent we should beware l we be convict of fastidious temerity in reject them i could wish them indeed to be bury in oblivion provide this faith be universally receive that the father son and holy spirit be the one god and that nevertheless the son be notthe father nor the spirit the son but that they be distinguish from each other by some peculiar property i be notso rigidly precise a to be fond of contend for mere word for i observe that the ancient who otherwise speak on these subject with great piety be notconsistent with each other nor in all case with themselves for what form of expression adopt by council do hilary excuse to what extremes do augustine sometimes proceed how different be the greek from the latin but of this variation let one example suffice when the latin would translate the word s they call it consubstantial signify the substance of the father and the son to be one and thus use substance for essence whence also jerome write to damasus pronounce it to be sacrilege to say that there be three substance in god yet that there be three substance in god you will find asserted in hilary more than a hundred time but how perplexed be jerome on the word hypostasis for he suspect some latent poison in the assertion that there be three hypostasis in god and if any one use this word in a pious sense he refrain notfrom call it an improper expression if indeed he be sincere in this declaration and do notrather knowingly and wilfully endeavour to asperse with a groundless calumny the bishop of the east whom he hat he certainly discover notmuch ingenuousness in affirm that in all the profane school sa essence be the same a pstas hypostasis which the trite and common use of the word universally contradict more modesty and liberality be discover by augustine who though he assert that the word hypostasis in this sense be new to latin ears yet leave the greek their usual phraseology and even peaceably tolerate the latin who have imitate their language and the account of socrates in the sixth book of hi tripartite history seem to imply that it be by ignorant men that it have first be improperly apply to this subject the same hilary accuse the heretic of a great crime in constrain him by their wickedness to expose to the danger of human language those thing which ought to be confine within the religion of the mind plainly avow that this be to do thing unlawful to express thing inexpressible to assume thing notconcede a little after he largely excuse himself for hi boldness in bring forward new term for when he have use the name of nature father son and spirit he immediately add that whatever be seek far be beyond the signification of language beyond the reach of our sens beyond the conception of our understanding and in another place he pronounce that happy be the bishop of gaul who have neither compose nor receive nor even know any other confession but that ancient and very simple one which have be receive in all the church from the day of the apostle very similar be the excuse of augustine that this word be extort by necessity on account of the poverty of human language on so great a subject notfor the sake of express what god be but to avoid pass it over in total silence that the father son and spirit be three this moderation of those holy men should teach u notto pass such severe censure on those who be unwilling to subscribe to expression adopt by u provide they be notactuate by pride perverseness or disingenuous subtlety but let them also on the other hand consider the great necessity which constrain u to use such language that by degree they may at length be accustom to a useful phraseology let them also learn to beware since we have to oppose the arians on one side and the sabellian on the other l while they take offence at both these party be deprive of all opportunity of evasion they cause some suspicion that they be themselves the disciple either of arius or of sabellius arius confess that christ be god but maintains also that he be create and have a beginning he acknowledge that christ be one with the father but secretly whisper in the ear of hi disciple that he be united to him like the rest of the faithful though by a singular privilege say that he be consubstantial you tear off the mask from the hypocrite and yet you add nothing to the scripture sabellius assert that the name father son and spirit be expressive of no distinction in the godhead say that they be three and he will exclaim that you be talk of three god say that in the one essence of god there be a trinity of person and you will at once express what the scripture declare and will restrain such frivolous loquacity now if any person be prevent by such excessive scrupulousness from admit these term yet notone of them can deny that when the scripture speaks of one god it should be understood of a unity of substance and that when it speak of three in one essence it denote the person in this trinity when this be honestly confess we have no further concern about word but i have find by long and frequent experience that those who pertinaciously contend about word cherish some latent poison so that it be well designedly to provoke their resentment than to use obscure language for the sake of obtain their favour but leave the dispute about term i shall now enter on the discussion of the subject itself what i denominate a person be a subsistence in the divine essence which be relate to the other and yet distinguish from them by an incommunicable property by the word subsistence we mean something different from the word essence for if the word be simply god and have no peculiar property john have be guilty of impropriety in say that he be always with god when he immediately add that the word also be god he remind u of the unity of the essence but because he could notbe with god without subsist in the father hence arise that subsistence which although inseparably connect with the essence have a peculiar mark by which it be distinguish from it now i say that each of the three subsistence have a relation to the other but be distinguish from them by a peculiar property we particularly use the word relation or comparison here because when mention be make simply and indefinitely of god this name pertain no less to the son and spirit than to the father but whenever the father be compare with the son the property peculiar to each distinguishes him from the other thirdly whatever be proper to each of them i assert to be incommunicable because whatever be ascribe to the father a a character of distinction can notbe apply or transfer to the son nor indeed do i disapprove of the definition of tertullian if rightly understand that there be in god a certain distribution or economy which make no change in the unity of the essence but before i proceed any further i must prove the deity of the son and of the holy spirit after which we shall see how they differ from each other when the scripture speaks of the word of god it certainly be very absurd to imagine it to be only a transient and momentary sound emit into the air and come forth from god himself of which nature be the oracle give to the father and all the prophecy it be rather to be understood of the eternal wisdom reside in god whence the oracle and all the prophecy proceed for accord to the testimony of peter the ancient prophet spake by the spirit of christ no less than the apostle and all the succeed minister of the heavenly doctrine but a christ have notyet be manifest we must necessarily understand that the word be beget of the father before the world begin and if the spirit that inspire the prophet be the spirit of the word we conclude beyond all doubt that the word be truly god and this be teach by moses with sufficient perspicuity in the creation of the world in which he represent the word a act such a conspicuous part for why do he relate that god in the creation of each of hi work say let this or that be do but that the unsearchable glory of god may resplendently appear in hi image captious and loquacious men would readily evade this argument by say that the word import an order or command but the apostle be good interpreter who declare that the world be create by the son and that he uphold all thing by the word of hi power for here we see that the word intend the nod or mandate of the son who be himself the eternal and essential son of the father nor to the wise and sober be there any obscurity in that passage of solomon where he introduce wisdom a begotten of the father before time begin and preside at the creation of the world and over all the work of god for to pretend that this denote some temporary expression of the will of god be foolish and frivolous whereas god then intend to discover hi fixed and eternal counsel and even something more secret to the same purpose also be that assertion of christ my father worketh hitherto and i work for by affirm that from the beginning of the world he have continually coperated with the father he make a more explicit declaration of what have be briefly glance at by moses we conclude therefore that god spake thus at the creation that the word might have hi part in the work and so that operation be common to both but john speak more clearly than all other when he represent the word who from the beginning be god with god a in union with the father the original cause of all thing for to the word he both attribute a real and permanent essence and assign some peculiar property and plainly show how god by speak create the world therefore a all divine revelation be justly entitle the word of god so we ought chiefly to esteem that substantial word the source of all revelation who be liable to no variation who remain with god perpetually one and the same and who be god himself here we be interrupt by some clamorous objector who since they can notopenly rob him of hi divinity secretly steal from him hi eternity for they say that the word only begin to exist when god open hi sacred mouth in the creation of the world but they be too inconsiderate in imagine something new in the substance of god for a those name of god which relate to hi external work begin to be ascribe to him after the existence of those work a when he be call the creator of heaven and earth so piety neither acknowledges nor admit any name signifying that god have find any thing new to happen to himself for could any thing from any quarter effect a change in him it would contradict the assertion of james that every good gift and every perfect gift be from above and cometh down from the father of light with whom be no variableness or shadow of turn nothing then be more intolerable than to suppose a beginning of that word which be always god and afterwards the creator of the world but they argue in their own apprehension most acutely that moses by represent god a have then speak for the first time implies also that there be no word in him before than which nothing be more absurd for it be notto be conclude because any thing begin to be manifest at a certain time that it have no prior existence i form a very different conclusion that since in the very instant when god say let there be light the power of the word be clearly manifest the word must have exist long before but if any one inquire how long he will find no beginning for he limit no certain period of time when he himself say o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i have with thee before the world be nor be this omit by john for before he descend to the creation of the world he declare that the word be in the beginning with god we therefore conclude again that the word conceived of god before time begin perpetually remain with him which prove hi eternity hi true essence and hi divinity though i advert notyet to the person of the mediator but defer it to that part of the work which will relate to redemption yet since it ought without controversy to be believe by all that christ be the very same word clothe in flesh any testimony which assert the deity of christ will be very properly introduce here when it be say in the fortyfifth psalm thy throne o god be for ever and ever the jew endeavour to evade it force by plead that the name elohim be applicable also to angel and to men of dignity and power but there can notbe find in the scripture a similar passage which erect an eternal throne for a creature for he be notmerely call god but be also declare to possess an eternal dominion besides this title be never give to a creature without some addition a when it be say that moses should be a god to pharaoh some read it in the genitive case thy throne be of god which be extremely insipid i confess indeed that what be eminently and singularly excellent be frequently call divine but it sufficiently appear from the context that such a meaning would be uncouth and force and totally inapplicable here but if their perverseness refuse to yield this point there certainly be no obscurity in isaiah where he introduce christ a god and a crown with supreme power which be the prerogative of god alone hi name say he shall be call the mighty god the father of eternity c here also the jew object and invert the reading of the passage in this manner this be the name by which the mighty god the father of eternity shall call him c so that they would leave the son only the title of prince of peace but to what purpose would so many epithet be accumulate in this passage on god the father when the design of the prophet be to distinguish christ by such eminent character a may establish our faith in him wherefore there can be no doubt that he be there denominate the mighty god just a a little before he be call immanuel but nothing can be require plain than a passage in jeremiah that this should be the name whereby the branch of david shall be call jehovah our righteousness for since the jew themselves teach that all other name of god be mere epithet but that this alone which they call ineffable be a proper name expressive of hi essence we conclude that the son be the one eternal god who declare in another place that he will notgive hi glory to another this also they endeavour to evade because moses impose this name on an altar which he build and ezekiel on the city of the new jerusalem but who do notperceive that the altar be erect a a monument of moses have be exalt by god and that jerusalem be honour with the name of god only a a testimony of the divine presence for thus speak the prophet the name of the city shall be jehovah be there but moses express himself thus he build an altar and call the name of it jehovahnissi my exaltation but there be more contention about another passage of jeremiah where the same title be give to jerusalem in these word this be the name wherewith she shall be call jehovah our righteousness but this testimony be so far from oppose the truth which we be defend that it rather confirm it for have before testify that christ be the true jehovah from whom righteousness proceeds he now pronounce that the church will have such a clear apprehension of it a to be able to glory in the same name in the former place then be show the original cause of righteousness in the latter the effect now if these thing do notsatisfy the jew i see notby what cavil they can evade the account of jehovah have so frequently appear in the character of an angel an angel be say to have appear to the holy father he claim for himself the name of the eternal god if it be object that this be speak with regard to the character which he sustain this by no mean remove the difficulty for a servant would never rob god of hi honour by permit sacrifice to be offer to himself but the angel refuse to eat bread command a sacrifice to be offer to jehovah he afterwards demonstrate that he be really jehovah himself therefore manoah and hi wife conclude from this evidence that they have see nota mere angel but god himself hence he say we shall surely die because we have see god when hi wife reply if the lord be pleased to kill u he would nothave receive a sacrifice at our hand she clearly acknowledge him to be god who before be call an angel moreover the reply of the angel himself remove every doubt why askest thou after my name see it be wonderful so much the more detestable be the impiety of servetus in assert that god never appear to abraham and the other patriarch but that they worship an angel in hi stead but the orthodox doctor of the church have truly and wisely understood and teach that the same chief angel be the word of god who even then begin to perform some service introductory to hi execution of the office of mediator for though he be notyet incarnate he descend a it be in a mediatorial capacity that he might approach the faithful with great familiarity hi familiar intercourse with men give him the name of an angel yet he still retain what properly belong to him and continue the ineffably glorious god the same truth be attest by hosea who after relate the wrestling of jacob with an angel say the lord jehovah god of host jehovah be hi memorial servetus again cavil that god employ the person of an angel a though the prophet do notconfirm what have be deliver by moseswherefore be it that thou dost ask after my name and the confession of the holy patriarch when he say i have see god face to face sufficiently declare that he be nota create angel but one in whom reside the ful of deity hence also the representation of paul that christ be the conductor of the people in the wilderness because though the time of hi humiliation be notyet arrive the eternal word then exhibit a type of the office to which he be appoint now if the second of zechariah be strictly and coolly examine the angel who send another angel be immediately pronounce the god of host and supreme power be ascribe to him i omit testimony innumerable on which our faith safely rest although they have little influence on the jew for when it be say in isaiah lo this be our god we have wait for him and he will save u this be jehovah all who have eye may perceive that this be god who arise for the salvation of hi people and the emphatical repetition of these pointed expression forbid an application of this passage to any other than to christ but still more plain and decisive be a passage of malachi where he prophesy that the lord who be then seek should come into hi temple the temple be exclusively consecrate to the one most high god yet the prophet claim it a belong to christ whence it follow that he be the same god that be always worship among the jew the new testament abound with innumerable testimony we must therefore endeavour briefly to select a few rather than to collect them all though the apostle spake of him after he have appear in flesh a the mediator yet all that i shall adduce will be adapt to prove hi eternal deity in the first place it be worthy of particular observation that the apostle represent those thing which be predict concern the eternal god a either already exhibit in christ or to be accomplish in him at some future period the prediction of isaiah that the lord of host would be for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the house of israel paul assert to have be fulfil in christ therefore he declare that christ be the lord of host there be a similar instance in another place we shall all stand say he before the judgmentseat of christ for it be write a i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god since god in isaiah declare this concern himself and christ actually exhibit it in hi own person it follow that he be that very god whose glory can notbe transfer to another the apostle quotation from the psalm also in hi epistle to the ephesian be evidently applicable to none but god when he ascend up on high he lead captivity captive understanding that ascension to have be prefigure by the exertion of the divine power in the signal victory of david over the heathen nation he signify that the text be more fully accomplish in christ thus john attest that it be the glory of the son which be reveal in a vision to isaiah whereas the prophet himself record that he saw the majesty of god and those praise which the apostle in the epistle to the hebrew ascribes to the son beyond all doubt most evidently belong to god thou lord in the beginning hast lay the foundation of the earth and the heaven be the work of thine hand c again let all the angel of god worship him nor be it any misapplication of them when he refer them to christ since all that be predict in those psalm have be accomplish only by him for it be he who arise and have mercy upon zion it be he who claim a hi own the dominion over all nation and island and why should john after have affirm at the commencement of hi gospel that the word be always god have hesitate to attribute to christ the majesty of god and why should paul have be afraid to place christ on the tribunal of god after have so publicly preach hi divinity when he call him god bless for ever and to show how consistent he be with himself on this subject he say also that god be manifest in the flesh if he be god bless for ever he be the same to whom this apostle in another place affirm all glory and honour to be due and he conceal notbut openly proclaim that be in the form of god he think it notrobbery to be equal with god but make himself of no reputation and l the impious might object that he be a sort of artificial god john go far and affirm that this be the true god and eternal life although we ought to be fully satisfy by hi be call god especially by a witness who expressly avers that there be no more god than one i mean paul who say though there be that be call god whether in heaven or in earth to u there be but one god of whom be all thing when we hear from the same mouth that god be manifest in the flesh that god hath purchase the church with hi own bloodwhy do we imagine a second god whom he by no mean acknowledges and there be no doubt that all the pious be of the same opinion thomas likewise by publicly confess him to be hi lord and god declare him to be the same true god whom he have always worship if we judge of hi divinity from the work which the scripture attribute to him it will thence appear with increase evidence for when he say that he have from the begin continually coperated with the father the jew stupid a they be about hi other declaration yet perceive that he assume to himself divine power and therefore a john inform u they seek the more to kill him because he notonly have break the sabbath but say also that god be hi father make himself equal with god how great then must be our stupidity if we perceive notthis passage to be a plain assertion of hi divinity to preside over the world by hi almighty providence and to govern all thing by the rod of hi own power which the apostle attribute to him belong exclusively to the creator and he participate with the father notonly in the government of the world but also in all other office which can notbe communicate to creatures the lord proclaims by the prophet i even i be he that blotteth out thy transgression for mine own sake accord to this declaration when the jew think that christ commit an injury against god by undertake to forgive sin he notonly assert in express term that this power belong to him but prove it by a miracle we see therefore that he hath notthe ministry but the power of remission of sin which the lord declare shall never be transfer from himself to another be it notthe prerogative of god alone to examine and penetrate the secret thought of the heart yet christ possess that power which be a proof of hi divinity but with what perspicuity of evidence do it appear in hi miracle though i grant that the prophet and apostle perform miracle similar and equal to hi yet there be a considerable difference in this respect that they in their ministry dispense the favour of god whereas hi miracle be perform by hi exertion of hi own power he sometimes indeed used prayer that he might glorify the father but in most instance we perceive the manifest display of hi own power and how should nothe be the true author of miracle who by hi own authority commit the dispensation of them to other for the evangelist relate that he give hi apostle power to raise the dead to heal the leprous to cast out devil c and they perform that ministry in such a manner a plainly to discover that the power proceed solely from christ in the name of jesus christ say peter arise and walk it be no wonder therefore that christ should bring forward hi miracle to convince the incredulity of the jew since be perform by hi own power they afford most ample evidence of hi divinity besides if out of god there be no salvation no righteousness no life but christ contain all these thing in himself it certainly demonstrate him to be god let it notbe object that life and salvation be infuse into him by god for he be notsay to have receive salvation but to be himself salvation and if no one be good but god alone how can he be a mere man who be i will notsay good and righteous but goodness and righteousness itself even from the beginning of the creation accord to the testimony of an evangelist in him be life and the life then exist a the light of men support by such proof therefore we venture to repose our faith and hope on him whereas we know that it be impious and sacrilegious for any man to place hi confidence in creature he say ye believe in god believe also in me and in this sense paul interpret two passage of isaiahwhosoever believeth on him shall notbe ashamed again there shall be a root of jesse that shall rise to reign over the gentile in him shall the gentile trust and why should we search for more testimony from scripture when this declaration occur so frequently he that believeth on me hath everlasting life the invocation arise from faith be also direct to him which nevertheless peculiarly belongs if any thing peculiarly belongs to the divine majesty for a prophet say whosoever shall call on the name of the lord jehovah shall be deliver and solomon the name of the lord be a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and be safe but the name of christ be invoke for salvation it follow therefore that he be jehovah moreover we have an example of such invocation in stephen when he say lord jesus receive my spirit and afterwards in the whole church a ananias testifies in the same book lord i have hear by many of this man how much evil he hath do to thy saintsthat call on thy name and to make it more clearly understood that all the ful of the godhead dwelleth bodily in christ the apostle confess that he have introduce among the corinthian no other doctrine than the knowledge of him and that this have be the only subject of hi preach what a remarkable and important consideration be it that the name of the son only be preach to u whereas god command u to glory in the knowledge of himself alone who can dare to assert that he be a mere creature the knowledge of whom be our only glory it must also be remark that the salutation prefix to the epistle of paul implore the same blessing from the son a from the father whence we learn notonly that those thing which our heavenly father bestows be obtain for u by hi intercession but that the son by a communion of power be himself the author of them this practical knowledge be unquestionably more certain and solid than any idle speculation for then the pious mind have the near view of the divine presence and almost touch it when it experience itself to be quicken illuminated save justified and sanctify wherefore the proof of the deity of the spirit must be derive principally from the same source there be no obscurity in the testimony of moses in the history of the creation that the spirit of god be expand on the abyss or chaos for it signify notonly that the beautiful state of the world which we now behold owes it preservation to the power of the spirit but that previously to it be thus adorn the spirit be engage in brood over the confused mass the declaration of isaiah bid defiance to all cavil and now the lord god and hi spirit hath send me for the holy spirit be unite in the exercise of supreme power in the mission of prophet which be a proof of hi divine majesty but the best confirmation a i have remark we shall derive from familiar experience for what the scripture ascribe to him and what we ourselves learn by the certain experience of piety be notat all applicable to any creature for it be he who be universally diffuse sustains and animate all thing in heaven and in earth and this very thing exclude him from the number of creature that he be circumscribe by no limit but transfuses through all hi own vigorous influence to inspire them with be life and motion this be clearly a work of deity again if regeneration to an incorruptible life be more important and excellent than any present life what must we think of him from whose power it proceed but the scripture teach in various place that he be the author of regeneration by a power notderive but properly hi own and not
