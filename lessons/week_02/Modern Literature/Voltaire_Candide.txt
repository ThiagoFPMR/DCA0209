have receive it from a jesuit who when a novice have it in a direct line from one of the companion of christopher columbus for my part i shall give it to nobody i be die oh pangloss cry candid what a strange genealogy be not the devil the original stock of it not at all reply this great man it be a thing unavoidable a necessary ingredient in the best of world for if columbus have not in an island of america catch this disease which contaminate the source of life frequently even hinders generation and which be evidently oppose to the great end of nature we should have neither chocolate nor cochineal we be also to observe that upon our continent this distemper be like religious controversy confine to a particular spot the turk the indian the persian the chinese the siamese the japanese know nothing of it but there be a sufficient reason for believe that they will know it in their turn in a few century in the meantime it have make marvellous progress among u especially in those great army compose of honest welldisciplined hireling who decide the destiny of state for we may safely affirm that when an army of thirty thousand men fight another of an equal number there be about twenty thousand of them pxd on each side well this be wonderful say candid but you must get cure ala how can i say pangloss i have not a farthing my friend and all over the globe there be no letting of blood

pangloss explain to him how everything be so constituted that it could not be good james be not of this opinion it be more likely say he mankind have a little corrupted nature for they be not bear wolf and they have become wolf god have give them neither cannon of fourandtwenty pounder nor bayonet and yet they have make cannon and bayonet to destroy one another into this account i might throw not only bankrupt but justice which seize on the effect of bankrupt to cheat the creditor all this be indispensable reply the oneeyed doctor for private misfortune make the general good so that the more private misfortune there be the great be the general good while he reason the sky darken the wind blow from the four quarter and the ship be assail by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of lisbon tempest shipwreck earthquake and what became of doctor pangloss candid and james the anabaptist half dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship produce onehalf of the passenger be not even sensible of the danger the other half shriek and pray the sheet be rent the mast break the vessel gap work who would no one heard no one command the anabaptist be upon deck bore a hand when a brutish sailor strike him roughly and lay him sprawl but with the violence of the blow he himself tumble head foremost overboard and stick upon a piece of the broken mast honest james run to hi assistance haul him up and from the effort he make be precipitate into the sea in sight of the sailor who leave him to perish without deign to look at him candid draw near and saw hi benefactor who rise above the water one moment and be then swallow up for ever he be just go to jump after him but be prevent by the philosopher pangloss who demonstrate to him that the bay of lisbon have be make on purpose for the anabaptist to be drown while he be prove this priori the ship founder all perish except pangloss candid and that brutal sailor who have drown the good anabaptist the villain swam safely to the shore while pangloss and candid be borne thither upon a plank as soon a they recover themselves a little they walk toward lisbon they have some money leave with which they hop to save themselves from starve after they have escape drown scarcely have they reach the city lament the death of their benefactor when they felt the earth tremble under their foot the sea swell and foam in the harbour and beat to piece the vessel rid at anchor whirlwind of fire and ash cover the street and public place house fell roof be flung upon the pavement and the pavement be scatter thirty thousand inhabitant of all age and sex be crush under the ruin the sailor whistling and swearing say there be booty to be gain here what can be the sufficient reason of this phenomenon say pangloss this be the last day cry candid the sailor run among the ruin face death to find money find it he take it get drunk and have sleep himself sober purchase the favour of the first goodnatured wench whom he meet on the ruin of the destroyed house and in the midst of the dying and the dead pangloss pull him by the sleeve my friend say he this be not right you sin against the universal reason you choose your time badly sblood and fury answer the other i be a sailor and bear at batavia four time have i trample upon the crucifix in four voyage to japan a fig for thy universal reason some fall stone have wound candid he lay stretch in the street cover with rubbish ala say he to pangloss get me a little wine and oil i be die this concussion of the earth be no new thing answer pangloss the city of lima in america experience the same convulsion last year the same cause the same effect there be certainly a train of sulphur under ground from lima to lisbon nothing more probable say candid but for the love of god a little oil and wine how probable reply the philosopher i maintain that the point be capable of be demonstrate candid faint away and pangloss fetch him some water from a neighbour fountain the following day they rummage among the ruin and find provision with which they repair their exhausted strength after this they join with other in relieve those inhabitant who have escape death some whom they have succour give them a good a dinner a they could in such disastrous circumstance true the repast be mournful and the company moisten their bread with tear but pangloss console them assure them that thing could not be otherwise for say he all that be be for the best if there be a volcano at lisbon it can not be elsewhere it be impossible that thing should be other than they be for everything be right a little man dress in black familiar of the inquisition who sit by him politely take up hi word and say apparently then sir you do not believe in original sin for if all be for the best there have then be neither fall nor punishment i humbly ask your excellency pardon answer pangloss still more politely for the fall and curse of man necessarily enter into the system of the best of world sir say the familiar you do not then believe in liberty your excellency will excuse me say pangloss liberty be consistent with absolute necessity for it be necessary we should be free for in short the determinate will pangloss be in the middle of hi sentence when the familiar beckon to hi footman who give him a glass of wine from porto or opporto how the portuguese made a beautiful autodaf to prevent any further earthquake and how candid wa publicly whipped after the earthquake have destroy threefourths of lisbon the sage of that country could think of no mean more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautiful autodaf for it have be decide by the university of coimbra that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire and

everything that have befall him since the moment of their separation cunegonde lift up her eye to heaven shed tear upon hearing of the death of the good anabaptist and of pangloss after which she speak a follow to candid who do not lose a word and devour her with hi eye the history of cunegonde i be in bed and fast asleep when it please god to send the bulgarian to our delightful castle of

the world be for the best agitated lose sometimes beside myself and sometimes ready to die of weakness my mind be fill with the massacre of my father mother and brother with the insolence of the ugly bulgarian soldier with the stab that he give me with my servitude under the bulgarian captain with my hideous don issachar with my abominable inquisitor with the execution of doctor pangloss with the

share with me in say this he draw a long poniard which he always carry about him and not imagine that hi adversary have any arm he throw himself upon candid but our honest westphalian have receive a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit of clothes he draw hi rapier despite hi gentleness and lay the israelite stone dead upon the cushion at cunegondes foot holy virgin cry she what will become of u a man kill in my apartment if the officer of justice come we be lose had not pangloss be hang say candid he would give u good counsel in this emergency for he be a profound

cruelly whip he be my rival and a i have now begin to kill i will kill away for there be no time to hesitate this reasoning be clear and instantaneous so that without give time to the inquisitor to recover from hi surprise he pierce him through and through and cast him beside the jew yet again say cunegonde now there be no mercy for u we be excommunicate our last hour have come how could you do it you naturally so gentle to slay a jew and a prelate in two minute my beautiful young lady respond candid when one be a lover jealous and whip by the inquisition one stop at nothing the old woman

my backside you would not talk in that manner but would suspend your judgment this speech have raise extreme curiosity in the mind of cunegonde and candid the old woman speak to them a follow history of the old woman i have not always blear eye and red eyelid neither do my nose always touch my chin nor be i always a servant i be the daughter of pope urban x and of the princess of palestrina until the age of fourteen i be bring up in a palace to which all the castle of your german baron would scarcely have serve for stable and one of my robe be worth more than all the magnificence of westphalia a i grow up i improve in beauty wit and every graceful accomplishment in the midst of pleasure hope and respectful homage already i inspire love my throat be form and such a throat white firm and shape like that of the venus of medici and what eye what eyelids what black eyebrows such flame dart from my dark pupil that they eclipse the scintillation of the starsas i be tell by the poet in our part of the world my wait woman when dress and undress me use to fall into an ecstasy whether they view me before or behind how glad would the gentleman have be to perform that office for them i be affiance to the most excellent prince of massa carara such a prince as handsome a myself sweettempered agreeable brilliantly witty and sparkle with love i love him a one love for the first timewith idolatry with transport the nuptials be prepare there be surprising pomp and magnificence there be ftes carousal continual opera bouffe and all italy compose sonnet in my praise though not one of them be passable i be just upon the point of reach the summit of bliss when an old marchioness who have be mistress to the prince my husband invite him to drink chocolate with her he die in less than two hour of most terrible convulsion but this be only a bagatelle my mother in despair and scarcely less afflicted than myself determine to absent herself for some time from so fatal a place she have a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of gaeta we embark on board a galley of the country which be gild like the great altar of st peter at rome a sallee corsair swoop down and board u our men defend themselves like the pope soldier they fling themselves upon their knee and throw down their arm begging of the corsair an absolution in articulo mortis instantly they be strip as bare a monkey my mother our maid of honour and myself be all serve in the same manner it be amaze with what expedition those gentry undress people but what surprise me most be that they thrust their finger into the part of our body which the generality of woman suffer no other instrument butpipes to enter it appear to me a very strange kind of ceremony but thus one judge of thing when one have not see the world i afterwards learn that it be to try whether we have conceal any diamond this be the practice establish from time immemorial among civilised nation that scour the sea i be inform that the very religious knight of malta never fail to make this search when they take any turkish prisoner of either sex it be a law of nation from which they never deviate i need not tell you how great a hardship it be for a young princess and her mother to be make slave and carry to morocco you may easily imagine all we have to suffer on board the pirate vessel my mother be still very handsome our maid of honour and even our wait woman have more charm than be to be find in all africa a for myself i be ravish be exquisite grace itself and i be a virgin i do not remain so long this flower which have be reserve for the handsome prince of massa carara be pluck by the corsair captain he be an abominable negro and yet believe that he do me a great deal of honour certainly the princess of palestrina and myself must have be very strong to go through all that we experience until our arrival at morocco but let u pass on these be such common thing a not to be worth mention morocco swam in blood when we arrive fifty son of the emperor muleyismael have each their adherent this produce fifty civil war of black against black and black against tawnies and tawnies against tawnies and mulatto against mulatto in short it be a continual carnage throughout the empire no sooner be we land than the black of a contrary faction to that of my captain attempt to rob him of hi booty next to jewel and gold we be the most valuable thing he have i be witness to such a battle a you have never see in your european climates the northern nation have not that heat in their blood nor that rag lust for woman so common in africa it seem that you european have only milk in your vein but it be vitriol it be fire which run in those of the inhabitant of mount atlas and the neighbouring country they fight with the fury of the lion tiger and serpent of the country to see who should have u a moor seize my mother by the right arm while my captain lieutenant hold her by the left a moorish soldier have hold of her by one leg and one of our corsair hold her by the other thus almost all our woman be draw in quarter by four men my captain conceal me behind him and with hi drawn scimitar cut and slash every one

do not despair say he to the disconsolate candid i understand a little of the jargon of these people i will speak to them be sure say candid to represent to them how frightfully inhuman it be to cook men and how very unchristian gentleman say cacambo you reckon you be today go to feast upon a jesuit it be all very well nothing be more unjust than thus to treat your enemy indeed the law of nature teach u to kill our neighbour and such be the practice all over the world if we do not accustom ourselves to eat them it be because we have good fare but you have not the same resource a we certainly it be much good to devour your enemy than to resign to the crow and rook the fruit of your victory but gentleman surely you would not choose to eat your friend you believe that you be go to spit a jesuit and he be your defender it be the enemy of your enemy that you be go to roast a for myself i be bear in your country this gentleman be my master and far from be a jesuit he have just kill one whose spoil he wear and thence come your mistake to convince you of the truth of what i say take hi habit and carry it to the first barrier of the jesuit kingdom and inform yourselves whether my master do not kill a jesuit officer it will not take you long and you can always eat u if you find that i have lie to you but i have tell you the truth you be too well acquaint with the principle of public law humanity and justice not to pardon u the oreillons find this speech very reasonable they depute two of their principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of the matter these execute their commission like men of sense and soon return with good news the oreillons untie their prisoner show them all sort of civility offer them girl give them refreshment and reconducted them to the confines of their territory proclaim with great joy he be no jesuit he be no jesuit candid could not help be surprise at the cause of hi deliverance what people say he what men what manner if i have not be so lucky a to run miss cunegondes brother through the body i should have be devour without redemption but after all pure nature be good since these people instead of feast upon my flesh have show me a thousand civility when then i be not a jesuit arrival of candid and hi valet at el dorado and what they saw there you see say cacambo to candid as soon a they have reach the frontier of the oreillons that this hemisphere be not well than the other take my word for it let u go back to europe by the short way how go back say candid and where shall we go to my own country the bulgarian and the abares be slay all to portugal there i shall be burn and if we abide here we be every moment in danger of be spit but how can i resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear cunegonde resides let u turn towards cayenne say cacambo there we shall find frenchman who wander all over the world they may assist u god will perhaps have pity on u it be not easy to get to cayenne they know vaguely in which direction to go but river precipice robber savage obstruct them all the way their horse die of fatigue their provision be consume they feed a whole month upon wild fruit and find themselves at last near a little river border with cocoa tree which sustain their life and their hope cacambo who be as good a counsellor a the old woman say to candid we be able to hold out no longer we have walk enough i see an empty canoe near the riverside let u fill it with cocoanut throw ourselves into it and go with the current a river always lead to some inhabit spot if we do not

will be receive a you deserve cacambo explain this whole discourse with great astonishment to candid who be a greatly astonish to hear it what sort of a country then be this say they to one another a country unknown to all the rest of the world and where nature be of a kind so different from ours it be probably the country where all be well for there absolutely must be one such place and whatever master pangloss might say i often find that thing go very ill in westphalia what they saw in the country of el dorado cacambo express hi curiosity to the landlord who make answer i be very ignorant but not the worse on that account however we have in this neighbourhood an old man retire from court who be the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom at once he take cacambo to the old man candid act now only a second character and accompany hi valet they enter a very plain house for the door be only of silver and the ceiling be only of gold but wrought in so elegant a taste a to vie with the rich the antechamber indeed be only encrust with ruby and emerald but the order in which everything be arrange make amends for this great simplicity the old man receive the stranger on hi sofa which be stuff with hummingbird feather and order hi servant to present them with liqueur in diamond goblet after which he satisfy their curiosity in the following term i be now one hundred and seventytwo year old and i learn of my late father master of the horse to the king the amazing revolution of peru of which he have be an eyewitness the kingdom we now inhabit be the ancient country of the inca who quit it very imprudently to conquer another part of the world and be at length destroy by the spaniard more wise by far be the prince of their family who remain in their native country and they ordain with the consent of the whole nation that none of the inhabitant should ever be permit to quit this little kingdom and this have preserve our innocence and happiness the spaniard have have a confused notion of this country and have call it el dorado and an englishman whose name be sir walter raleigh come very near it about a hundred year ago but be surround by inaccessible rock and precipice we have hitherto be shelter from the rapaciousness of european nation who have an inconceivable passion for the pebble and dirt of our land for the sake of which they would murder u to the last man the conversation be long it turn chiefly on their form of government their manner their woman their public entertainment and the art at length candid have always have a taste for metaphysics make cacambo ask whether there be any religion in that country the old man redden a little how then say he can you doubt it do you take u for ungrateful wretch cacambo humbly ask what be the religion in el dorado the old man redden again can there be two religion say he we have i believe the religion of all the world we worship god night and morning do you worship but one god say cacambo who still act a interpreter in represent candid doubt surely say the old man there be not two nor three nor four i must confess the people from your side of the world ask very extraordinary question candid be not yet tire of interrogate the good old man he want to know in what manner they pray to god in el dorado we do not pray to him say the worthy sage we have nothing to ask of him he have give u all we need and we return him thanks without cease candid have a curiosity to see the priest ask where they be the good old man smile my friend say he we be all priest the king and all the head of family sing solemn canticle of thanksgiving every morning accompany by five or six thousand musician what have you no monk who teach who dispute who govern who cabal and who burn people that be not of their opinion we must be mad indeed if that be the case say the old man here we be all of one opinion and we know not what you mean by monk during this whole discourse candid be in rapture and he say to himself this be vastly different from westphalia and the baron castle have our friend pangloss see el dorado he would no longer have say that the castle of thundertentronckh be the fine upon earth it be evident that one must travel after this long conversation the old man order a coach and six sheep to be get ready and twelve of hi domestic to conduct the traveller to court excuse me say he if my age deprive me of the honour of accompany you the king will receive you in a manner that can not displease you and no doubt you will make an allowance for the custom of the country if some thing should not be to your like candid and cacambo get into the coach the six sheep flew and in less than four hour they reach the king palace situate at the extremity of the capital the portal be two hundred and twenty foot high and one hundred wide but word be want to express the material of which it be build it be plain such material must have prodigious superiority over those pebble and sand which we call gold and precious stone twenty beautiful damsel of the king guard receive candid and cacambo a they alight from the coach conduct them to the bath and dress them in robes woven of the down of hummingbird after which the great crown officer of both sex lead them to the king apartment between two file of musician a thousand on each side when they draw near to the audience chamber cacambo ask one of the great officer in what way he should pay hi obeisance to hi majesty whether they should throw themselves upon their knee or on their stomach whether they should put their hand upon their head or behind their back whether they should lick the dust off the floor in a word what be the ceremony the custom say the great officer be to embrace the king and to kiss him on each cheek candid and cacambo throw themselves round hi majesty neck he receive them with all the goodness imaginable and politely invite them to supper while wait they be show the city and saw the public edifice raise as high a the cloud the market place ornament with a thousand columns the fountain of spring water those of rise water those of liqueur draw from sugarcane incessantly flow into the great square which be pave with a kind of precious stone which give off a delicious fragrancy like that of clove and cinnamon candid ask to see the court of justice the parliament they tell him they have none and that they be stranger to lawsuit he ask if they have any prison and they answer no but what surprise him most and give him the great pleasure be the palace of science where he saw a gallery two thousand foot long and fill with instrument employ in mathematics and physic after ramble about the city the whole afternoon and see but a thousandth part of it they be reconducted to the royal palace where candid sit down to table with hi majesty hi valet cacambo and several lady never be there a good entertainment and never be more wit show at a table than that which fell from hi majesty cacambo explain the king bonmots to candid and notwithstanding they be translate they still appear to be bonmots of all the thing that surprise candid this be not the least they spend a month in this hospitable place candid frequently say to cacambo i own my friend once more that the castle where i be bear be nothing in comparison with this but after all miss cunegonde be not here and you have without doubt some mistress in europe if we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest whereas if we return to our old world only with twelve sheep laden with the pebble of el dorado we shall be rich than all the king in europe we shall have no more inquisitor to fear and we may easily recover miss cunegonde this speech be agreeable to cacambo mankind be so fond of rove of make a figure in their own country and of boasting of what they have see in their travel that the two happy one resolve to be no longer so but to ask hi majesty leave to quit the country you be foolish say the king i be sensible that my kingdom be but a small place but when a person be comfortably settle in any part he should abide there i have not the right to detain stranger it be a tyranny which neither our manner nor our law permit all men be free go when you wish but the go will be very difficult it be impossible to ascend that rapid river on which you come a by a miracle and which run under vaulted rock the mountain which surround my kingdom be ten thousand foot high and as steep a wall they be each over ten league in breadth and there be no other way to descend them than by precipice however since you absolutely wish to depart i shall give order to my engineer to construct a machine that will convey you very safely when we have conduct you over the mountain no one can accompany you far for my subject have make a vow never to quit the kingdom and they be too wise to break it ask me besides anything that you please we desire nothing of your majesty say candid but a few sheep laden with provision pebble and the earth of this country the king laugh i can not conceive say he what pleasure you european find in our yellow clay but take as much a you like and great good may it do you at once he give direction that hi engineer should construct a machine to hoist up these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom three thousand good mathematician go to work it be ready in fifteen day and do not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that country they place candid and cacambo on the machine there be two great red sheep saddle and bridle to ride upon as soon a they be beyond the mountain twenty packsheep laden with provision thirty with present of the curiosity of the country and fifty with gold diamond and precious stone the king embrace the two wanderer very tenderly their departure with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep be hoist over the mountain be a splendid spectacle the mathematician take their leave after convey them to a place of safety and candid have no other desire no other aim than to present hi sheep to miss cunegonde now say he we be able to pay the governor of buenos ayr if miss cunegonde can be ransom let u journey towards cayenne let u embark and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase what happened to them at surinam and how candid got acquainted with martin our traveller spend the first day very agreeably they be delight with possess more treasure than all asia europe and africa could scrape together candid in hi rapture cut cunegondes name on the tree the second day two of their sheep plunge into a morass where they and their burden be lose two more died of fatigue a few day after seven or eight perish with hunger in a desert and other subsequently fell down precipice at length after travel a hundred day only two sheep remain said candid to cacambo my friend you see how perishable be the rich of this world there be nothing solid but virtue and the happiness of see cunegonde once more i grant all you say say cacambo but we have still two sheep remain with more treasure than the king of spain will ever have and i see a town which i take to be surinam belong to the dutch we be at the end of all our trouble and at the beginning of happiness a they draw near the town they saw a negro stretch upon the ground with only one moiety of hi clothes that be of hi blue linen drawers the poor man have lose hi left leg and hi right hand good god say candid in dutch what art thou do there friend in that shock condition i be wait for my master mynheer vanderdendur the famous merchant answer the negro be it mynheer vanderdendur say candid that treat thee thus yes sir say the negro it be the custom they give u a pair of linen drawer for our whole garment twice a year when we work at the sugarcane and the mill snatch hold of a finger they cut off the hand and when we attempt to run away they cut off the leg both case have happen to me this be the price at which you eat sugar in europe yet when my mother sell me for ten patagons on the coast of guinea she say to me my dear child bless our fetich adore them for ever they will make thee live happily thou hast the honour of be the slave of our lord the white which be make the fortune of thy father and mother ala i know not whether i have make their fortune this i know that they have not make mine dog monkey and parrot be a thousand time less wretched than i the dutch fetich who have convert me declare every sunday that we be all of u child of adamblacks as well a white i be not a genealogist but if these preacher tell truth we be all second cousin now you must agree that it be impossible to treat one relation in a more barbarous manner oh pangloss cry candid thou hadst not guess at this abomination it be the end i must at last renounce thy optimism what be this optimism say cacambo ala say candid it be the madness of maintain that everything be right when it be wrong look at the negro he shed tear and weep he enter surinam the first thing they inquire after be whether there be a vessel in the harbour which could be send to buenos ayr the person to whom they apply be a spanish seacaptain who offer to agree with them upon reasonable term he appoint to meet them at a publichouse whither candid and the faithful cacambo go with their two sheep and await hi come candid who have hi heart upon hi lip tell the spaniard all hi adventure and avow that he intend to elope with miss cunegonde then i will take good care not to carry you to buenos ayr say the seaman i should be hang and so would you the fair cunegonde be my lord favourite mistress this be a thunderclap for candid he weep for a long while at last he draw cacambo aside here my dear friend say he to him this thou must do we have each of u in hi pocket five or six million in diamond you be more clever than i you must go and bring miss cunegonde from buenos ayr if the governor make any difficulty give him a million if he will not relinquish her give him two a you have not kill an inquisitor they will have no suspicion of you ill get another ship and go and wait for you at venice thats a free country where there be no danger either from bulgarian abares jew or inquisitor cacambo applaud this wise resolution he despair at part from so good a master who have become hi intimate friend but the pleasure of serve him prevail over the pain of leave him they embrace with tear candid charge him not to forget the good old woman cacambo set out that very same day this cacambo be a very honest fellow candid stay some time longer in surinam wait for another captain to carry him and the two remain sheep to italy after he have hire domestic and purchase everything necessary for a long voyage mynheer vanderdendur captain of a large vessel come and offer hi service how much will you charge say he to this man to carry me straight to veniceme my servant my baggage and these two sheep the skipper ask ten thousand piastre candid do not hesitate oh oh say the prudent vanderdendur to himself this stranger give ten thousand piastre unhesitatingly he must be very rich return a little while after he let him know that upon second consideration he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand piastre well you shall have them say candid ay say the skipper to himself this man agree to pay twenty thousand piastre with as much ease a ten he go back to him again and declare that he could not carry him to venice for less than thirty thousand piastre then you shall have thirty thousand reply candid oh oh say the dutch skipper once more to himself thirty thousand piastre be a trifle to this man surely these sheep must be laden with an immense treasure let u say no more about it first of all let him pay down the thirty thousand piastre then we shall see candid sell two small diamonds the least of which be worth more than what the skipper ask for hi freight he pay him in advance the two sheep be put on board candid follow in a little boat to join the vessel in the road the skipper seize hi opportunity set sail and put out to sea the wind favour him candid dismay and stupefy soon lose sight of the vessel ala say he this be a trick worthy of the old world he put back overwhelmed with sorrow for indeed he have lose sufficient to make the fortune of twenty monarch he wait upon the dutch magistrate and in hi distress he knock over loudly at the door he enter and tell hi adventure raise hi voice with unnecessary vehemence the magistrate begin by fin him ten thousand piastre for make a noise then he listen patiently promise to examine into hi affair at the skipper return and order him to pay ten thousand piastre for the expense of the hearing this drive candid to despair he have indeed endure misfortune a thousand time worse the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper who have rob him rouse hi choler and flung him into a deep melancholy the villainy of mankind present itself before hi imagination in all it deformity and hi mind be fill with gloomy idea at length hearing that a french vessel be ready to set sail for bordeaux a he have no sheep laden with diamond to take along with him he hire a cabin at the usual price he make it know in the town that he would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastre to any honest man who would make the voyage with him upon condition that this man be the most dissatisfied with hi state and the most unfortunate in the whole province such a crowd of candidate present themselves that a fleet of ship could hardly have hold them candid be desirous of select from among the best mark out about onetwentieth of them who seem to be sociable men and who all pretend to merit hi preference he assemble them at hi inn and give them a supper on condition that each take an oath to relate hi history faithfully promise to choose him who appear to be most justly discontent with hi state and to bestow some present upon the rest they sit until four oclock in the morning candid in listen to all their adventure be remind of what the old woman have say to him in their voyage to buenos ayr and of her wager that there be not a person on board the ship but have meet with very great misfortune he dream of pangloss at every adventure tell to him this pangloss say he would be puzzle to demonstrate hi system i wish that he be here certainly if all thing be good it be in el dorado and not in the rest of the world at length he make choice of a poor man of letter who have work ten year for the bookseller of amsterdam he judge that there be not in the whole world a trade which could disgust one more this philosopher be an honest man but he have be rob by hi wife beat by hi son and abandon by hi daughter who get a portuguese to run away with her he have just be deprive of a small employment on which he subsist and he be persecute by the preacher of surinam who take him for a socinian we must allow that the other be at least as wretched a he but candid hop that the philosopher would entertain him during the voyage all the other candidate complain that candid have do them great injustice but he appease them by give one hundred piastre to each what happened at sea to candid and martin the old philosopher whose name be martin embark then with candid for bordeaux they have both see and suffer a great deal and if the vessel have sail from surinam to japan by the cape of good hope the subject of moral and natural evil would have enable them to entertain one another during the whole voyage candid however have one great advantage over martin in that he always hop to see miss cunegonde whereas martin have nothing at all to hope besides candid be possess of money and jewel and though he have lose one hundred large red sheep laden with the great treasure upon earth though the knavery of the dutch skipper still sit heavy upon hi mind yet when he reflect upon what he have still leave and when he mention the name of cunegonde especially towards the latter end of a repast he incline to pangloss doctrine but you mr martin say he to the philosopher what do you think of all this what be your idea on moral and natural evil sir answer martin our priest accuse me of be a socinian but the real fact be i be a manichean you jest say candid there be no longer manichean in the world i be one say martin i can not help it i know not how to think otherwise surely you must be possess by the devil say candid he be so deeply concern in the affair of this world answer martin that he may very well be in me as well a in everybody els but i own to you that when i cast an eye on this globe or rather on this little ball i can not help think that god have abandon it to some malignant be i except always el dorado i scarcely ever know a city that do not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city nor a family that do not wish to exterminate some other family everywhere the weak execrate the powerful before whom they cringe and the powerful beat them like sheep whose wool and flesh they sell a million regimented assassin from one extremity of europe to the other get their bread by disciplined depredation and murder for want of more honest employment even in those city which seem to enjoy peace and where the art flourish the inhabitant be devour by more envy care and uneasiness than be experience by a besieged town secret grief be more cruel than public calamity in a word i have see so much and experience so much that i be a manichean there be however some thing good say candid that may be say martin but i know them not in the middle of this dispute they hear the report of cannon it redouble every instant each take out hi glass they saw two ship in close fight about three mile off the wind bring both so near to the french vessel that our traveller have the pleasure of see the fight at their ease at length one let off a broadside so low and so truly aim that the other sank to the bottom candid and martin could plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sink vessel they raise their hand to heaven and uttered terrible outcry and the next moment be swallow up by the sea well say martin this be how men treat one another it be true say candid there be something diabolical in this affair while speak he saw he know not what of a shining red swimming close to the vessel they put out the longboat to see what it could be it be one of hi sheep candid be more rejoiced at the recovery of this one sheep than he have be grieve at the loss of the hundred laden with the large diamond of el dorado the french captain soon saw that the captain of the victorious vessel be a spaniard and that the other be a dutch pirate and the very same one who have rob candid the immense plunder which this villain have amass be bury with him in the sea and out of the whole only one sheep be save you see say candid to martin that crime be sometimes punish this rogue of a dutch skipper have meet with the fate he deserve yes say martin but why should the passenger be doom also to destruction god have punish the knave and the devil have drown the rest the french and spanish ship continue their course and candid continue hi conversation with martin they dispute fifteen successive day and on the last of those fifteen day they be a far advanced a on the first but however they chat they communicate idea they console each other candid caress hi sheep since i have find thee again say he i may likewise chance to find my cunegonde candid and martin reasoning draw near the coast of france at length they descry the coast of france were you ever in france mr martin say candid yes say martin i have be in several province in some onehalf of the people be fool in other they be too cunning in some they be weak and simple in other they affect to be witty in all the principal occupation be love the next be slander and the third be talk nonsense but mr martin have you see paris yes i have all these kind be find there it be a chaosa confuse multitude where everybody seek pleasure and scarcely any one find it at least a it appear to me i make a short stay there on my arrival i be rob of all i have by pickpocket at the fair of st germain i myself be take for a robber and be imprison for eight day after which i serve a corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for my return to holland on foot i know the whole scribbling rabble the party rabble the fanatic rabble it be say that there be very polite people in that city and i wish to believe it for my part i have no curiosity to see france say candid you may easily imagine that after spend a month at el dorado i can desire to behold nothing upon earth but miss cunegonde i go to await her at venice we shall pass through france on our way to italy will you bear me company with all my heart say martin it be say that venice be fit only for it own nobility but that stranger meet with a very good reception if they have a good deal of money i have none of it you have therefore i will follow you all over the world but do you believe say candid that the earth be originally a sea a we find it assert in that large book belonging to the captain i do not believe a word of it say martin any more than i do of the many raving which have be publish lately but for what end then have this world be form say candid to plague u to death answer martin are you not greatly surprised continue candid at the love which these two girl of the oreillons have for those monkey of which i have already tell you not at all say martin i do not see that that passion be strange i have see so many extraordinary thing that i have cease to be surprise do you believe say candid that men have always massacre each other a they do today that they have always be liars cheat traitor ingrates brigand idiots thief scoundrel glutton drunkard miser envious ambitious bloodyminded calumniators debauchee fanatic hypocrite and fool do you believe say martin that hawk have always eat pigeon when they have find them yes without doubt say candid well then say martin if hawk have always have the same character why should you imagine that men may have change theirs oh say candid there be a vast deal of difference for free will and reason thus they arrive at bordeaux what happened in france to candid and martin candid stay in bordeaux no long than be necessary for the selling of a few of the pebble of el dorado and for hire a good chaise to hold two passenger for he could not travel without hi philosopher martin he be only vexed at part with hi sheep which he leave to the bordeaux academy of science who set a a subject for that year prize to find why this sheep wool be red and the prize be award to a learned man of the north who demonstrate by a plus b minus c divide by z that the sheep must be red and die of the rot meanwhile all the traveller whom candid meet in the inn along hi route say to him we go to paris this general eagerness at length give him too a desire to see this capital and it be not so very great a dtour from the road to venice he enter paris by the suburb of st marceau and fancy that he be in the dirty village of westphalia scarcely be candid arrive at hi inn than he find himself attack by a slight illness cause by fatigue a he have a very large diamond on hi finger and the people of the inn have take notice of a prodigiously heavy box among hi baggage there be two physician to attend him though he have never send for them and two devotee who warm hi broth i remember martin say also to have be sick at paris in my first voyage i be very poor thus i have neither friend devotee nor doctor and i recover however what with physic and bleed candid illness become serious a parson of the neighborhood come with great meekness to ask for a bill for the other world payable to the bearer candid would do nothing for him but the devotee assure him it be the new fashion he answer that he be not a man of fashion martin wish to throw the priest out of the window the priest swore that they would not bury candid martin swear that he would bury the priest if he continue to be troublesome the quarrel grow heated martin take him by the shoulder and roughly turn him out of door which occasion great scandal and a lawsuit candid get well again and during hi convalescence he have very good company to sup with him they play high candid wonder why it be that the ace never come to him but martin be not at all astonish among those who do him the honour of the town be a little abb of perigord one of those busybody who be ever alert officious forward fawn and complaisant who watch for stranger in their passage through the capital tell them the scandalous history of the town and offer them pleasure at all price he first take candid and martin to la comdie where they play a new tragedy candid happen to be seat near some of the fashionable wit this do not prevent hi shed tear at the wellacted scene one of these critic at hi side say to him between the act your tear be misplace that be a shock actress the actor who play with her be yet bad and the play be still bad than the actor the author do not know a word of arabic yet the scene be in arabia moreover he be a man that do not believe in innate idea and i will bring you tomorrow twenty pamphlet write against him how many drama have you in france sir say candid to the abb five or six thousand what a number say candid how many good fifteen or sixteen reply the other what a number say martin candid be very pleased with an actress who play queen elizabeth in a somewhat insipid tragedy sometimes act that actress say he to martin please me much she have a likeness to miss cunegonde i should be very glad to wait upon her the perigordian abb offer to introduce him candid bring up in germany ask what be the etiquette and how they treat queen of england in france it be necessary to make distinction say the abb in the province one take them to the inn in paris one respect them when they be beautiful and throw them on the highway when they be dead queen on the highway say candid yes truly say martin the abb be right i be in paris when miss monime pass a the say be from this life to the other she be refuse what people call the honour of sepulturethat be to say of rot with all the beggar of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery she be inter all alone by her company at the corner of the rue de bourgogne which ought to trouble her much for she think nobly that be very uncivil say candid what would you have say martin these people be make thus imagine all contradiction all possible incompatibilitiesyou will find them in the government in the lawcourt in the church in the public show of this droll nation be it true that they always laugh in paris say candid yes say the abb but it mean nothing for they complain of everything with great fit of laughter they even do the most detestable thing while laugh who say candid be that great pig who speak so ill of the piece at which i weep and of the actor who give me so much pleasure he be a bad character answer the abb who gain hi livelihood by say evil of all play and of all book he hat whatever succeed a the eunuchs hate those who enjoy he be one of the serpent of literature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite he be a folliculaire what be a folliculaire say candid it be say the abb a pamphleteera frron thus candid martin and the perigordian converse on the staircase while watch every one go out after the performance although i be eager to see cunegonde again say candid i should like to sup with miss clairon for she appear to me admirable the abb be not the man to approach miss clairon who saw only good company she be engage for this evening he say but i shall have the honour to take you to the house of a lady of quality and there you will know paris a if you have live in it for year candid who be naturally curious let himself be take to this lady house at the end of the faubourg st honor the company be occupy in play faro a dozen melancholy punter hold each in hi hand a little pack of card a bad record of hi misfortune profound silence reign pallor be on the face of the punter anxiety on that of the banker and the hostess sit near the unpitying banker notice with lynxeyes all the double and other increased stake a each player dogseared hi card she make them turn down the edge again with severe but polite attention she show no vexation for fear of lose her customer the lady insist upon be call the marchioness of parolignac her daughter age fifteen be among the punter and notify with a covert glance the cheating of the poor people who try to repair the cruelty of fate the perigordian abb candid and martin enter no one rise no one salute them no one look at them all be profoundly occupy with their card the baroness of thundertentronckh be more polite say candid however the abb whisper to the marchioness who half rise honoured candid with a gracious smile and martin with a condescending nod she give a seat and a pack of card to candid who lose fifty thousand franc in two deal after which they sup very gaily and every one be astonish that candid be not move by hi loss the servant say among themselves in the language of servant some english lord be here this even the supper pass at first like most parisian supper in silence follow by a noise of word which could not be distinguish then with pleasantry of which most be insipid with false news with bad reason a little politics and much evil speaking they also discuss new book have you see say the perigordian abb the romance of sieur gauchat doctor of divinity yes answer one of the guest but i have not be able to finish it we have a crowd of silly writing but all together do not approach the impertinence of gauchat doctor of divinity i be so satiated with the great number of detestable book with which we be inundate that i be reduce to punt at faro and the mlanges of archdeacon trublet what do you say of that say the abb ah say the marchioness of parolignac the wearisome mortal how curiously he repeat to you all that the world know how heavily he discuss that which be not worth the trouble of lightly remark upon how without wit he appropriate the wit of other how he spoil what he steal how he disgust me but he will disgust me no longerit be enough to have read a few of the archdeacon page there be at table a wise man of taste who support the marchioness they speak afterwards of tragedy the lady ask why there be tragedy which be sometimes play and which could not be read the man of taste explain very well how a piece could have some interest and have almost no merit he prove in few word that it be not enough to introduce one or two of those situation which one find in all romance and which always seduce the spectator but that it be necessary to be new without be odd often sublime and always natural to know the human heart and to make it speak to be a great poet without allow any person in the piece to appear to be a poet to know language perfectlyto speak it with purity with continuous harmony and without rhythm ever take anything from sense whoever add he do not observe all these rule can produce one or two tragedy applaud at a theatre but he will never be count in the rank of good writer there be very few good tragedy some be idyll in dialogue well write and well rhymed other political reasoning which lull to sleep or amplification which repel other

little judged that the lady who act the part of cunegonde be a cheat that the perigordian abb be a knave who have impose upon the honest simplicity of candid and that the officer be another knave whom they might easily silence candid advise by martin and impatient to see the real cunegonde rather than expose himself before a court of justice propose to the officer to give him three small diamond

which have be commit in other year and other month by other poor devil who have hear nonsense speak the officer then explain what the abb meant ah the monster cry candid what horrors among a people

have become the most subservient of men put candid and hi attendant on board a vessel that be just ready to set sail for portsmouth in england this be not the way to venice but candid think he have make hi way out of hell and reckon that he would soon have an opportunity for resume hi journey candid and martin touched upon the coast of england and what they saw there ah pangloss pangloss ah martin martin ah my dear cunegonde what sort of a world be this say candid on board the dutch ship something very foolish and abominable say martin you know england are they a foolish there a in france it be another kind of folly say martin you know that these two nation be at war for a few acre of snow in canada and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than canada be worth to tell you exactly whether there be more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other be what my imperfect intelligence will not permit i only know in general that the people we be go to see be very atrabilious talk thus they arrive at portsmouth the coast be line with crowd of people whose eye be fix on a fine man kneel with hi eye bandage on board one of the men of war in the harbour four soldier stand opposite to this man each of them fire three ball at hi head with all the calmness in the world and the whole assembly go away very well satisfied what be all this say candid and what demon be it that exercise hi empire in this country he then ask who be that fine man who have be kill with so much ceremony they answer he be an admiral and why kill this admiral it be because he do not kill a sufficient number of men himself he give battle to a french admiral and it have be prove that he be not near enough to him but reply candid the french admiral be a far from the english admiral there be no doubt of it but in this country it be find good from time to time to kill one admiral to encourage the other candid be so shocked and bewilder by what he saw and hear that he would not set foot on shore and he make a bargain with the dutch skipper be he even to rob him like the surinam captain to conduct him without delay to venice the skipper be ready in two day they coast france they pass in sight of lisbon and candid tremble they pass through the strait and enter the mediterranean at last they land at venice god be praise say candid embrace martin it be here that i shall see again my beautiful cunegonde i trust cacambo a myself all be well all will be well all go as well a possible of paquette and friar girofle upon their arrival at venice candid go to search for cacambo at every inn and coffeehouse and among all the lady of pleasure but to no purpose he send every day to inquire on all the ship that come in but there be no news of cacambo what say he to martin i have have time to voyage from surinam to bordeaux to go from bordeaux to paris from paris to dieppe from dieppe to portsmouth to coast along portugal and spain to cross the whole mediterranean to spend some month and yet the beautiful cunegonde have not arrive instead of her i have only meet a parisian wench and a perigordian abb cunegonde be dead without doubt and there be nothing for me but to die ala how much good it would have be for me to have remain in the paradise of el dorado than to come back to this curse europe you be in the right my dear martin all be misery and illusion he fell into a deep melancholy and neither go to see the opera nor any of the other diversion of the carnival nay he be proof against the temptation of all the lady you be in truth very simple say martin to him if you imagine that a mongrel valet who have five or six million in hi pocket will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to venice if he find her he will keep her to himself if he do not find her he will get another i advise you to forget your valet cacambo and your mistress cunegonde martin be not console candid melancholy increase and martin continue to prove to him that there be very little virtue or happiness upon earth except perhaps in el dorado where nobody could gain admittance while they be dispute on this important subject and wait for cunegonde candid saw a young theatin friar in st mark piazza hold a girl on hi arm the theatin look fresh coloured plump and vigorous hi eye be sparkle hi air assure hi look lofty and hi step bold the girl be very pretty and sing she look amorously at her theatin and from time to time pinch hi fat cheek at least you will allow me say candid to martin that these two be happy hitherto i have meet with none but unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe except in el dorado but a to this pair i would venture to lay a wager that they be very happy i lay you they be not say martin we need only ask them to dine with u say candid and you will see whether i be mistaken immediately he accost them present hi compliment and invite them to hi inn to eat some macaroni with lombard partridge and caviare and to drink some montepulciano lachrym christi cyprus and samos wine the girl blush the theatin accept the invitation and she follow him cast her eye on candid with confusion and surprise and drop a few tear no sooner have she set foot in candid apartment than she cry out ah mr candid do not know paquette again candid have not view her a yet with attention hi thought be entirely take up with cunegonde but recollect her a she speak ala say he my poor child it be you who reduce doctor pangloss to the beautiful condition in which i saw him alas it be i sir indeed answer paquette i see that you have hear all i have be inform of the frightful disaster that befall the family of my lady baroness and the fair cunegonde i swear to you that my fate have be scarcely less sad i be very innocent when you know me a grey friar who be my confessor easily seduce me the consequence be terrible i be oblige to quit the castle some time after the baron have send you away with kick on the backside if a famous surgeon have not take compassion on me i should have die for some time i be this surgeon mistress merely out of gratitude hi wife who be mad with jealousy beat me every day unmercifully she be a fury the surgeon be one of the ugly of men and i the most wretched of woman to be continually beat for a man i do not love you know sir what a dangerous thing it be for an illnatured woman to be marry to a doctor incense at the behaviour of hi wife he one day give her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold that she die two hour after in most horrid convulsion the wife relation prosecute the husband he take flight and i be throw into jail my innocence would not have save me if i have not be goodlooking the judge set me free on condition that he succeed the surgeon i be soon supplant by a rival turn out of door quite destitute and oblige to continue this abominable trade which appear so pleasant to you men while to u woman it be the utmost abyss of misery i have come to exercise the profession at venice ah sir if you could only imagine what it be to be oblige to caress indifferently an old merchant a lawyer a monk a gondolier an abb to be expose to abuse and insult to be often reduce to borrow a petticoat only to go and have it raise by a disagreeable man to be rob by one of what one have earn from another to be subject to the extortion of the officer of justice and to have in prospect only a frightful old age a hospital and a dunghill you would conclude that i be one of the most unhappy creature in the world paquette thus open her heart to honest candid in the presence of martin who say to hi friend you see that already i have win half the wager friar girofle stay in the diningroom and drink a glass or two of wine while he be wait for dinner but say candid to paquette you look so gay and content when i meet you you sing and you behave so lovingly to the theatin that you seem to me as happy a you pretend to be now the reverse ah sir answer paquette this be one of the misery of the trade yesterday i be rob and beat by an officer yet today i must put on good humour to please a friar candid want no more convincing he own that martin be in the right they sit down to table with paquette and the theatin the repast be entertain and towards the end they converse with all confidence father say candid to the friar you appear to me to enjoy a state that all the world might envy the flower of health shine in your face your expression make plain your happiness you have a very pretty girl for your recreation and you seem well satisfy with your state a a theatin my faith sir say friar girofle i wish that all the theatins be at the bottom of the sea i have be tempt a hundred time to set fire to the convent and go and become a turk my parent force me at the age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit to increase the fortune of a cursed elder brother whom god confound jealousy discord and fury dwell in the convent it be true i have preach a few bad sermon that have bring me in a little money of which the prior stole half while the rest serve to maintain my girl but when i return at night to the monastery i be ready to dash my head against the wall of the dormitory and all my fellow be in the same case martin turn towards candid with hi usual coolness well say he have i not win the whole wager candid give two thousand piastre to paquette and one thousand to friar girofle ill answer for it say he that with this they will be happy i do not believe it at all say martin you will perhaps with these piastre only render them the more unhappy let that be a it may say candid but one thing console me i see that we often meet with those whom we expect never to see more so that perhaps a i have find my red sheep and paquette it may well be that i shall also find cunegonde i wish say martin she may one day make you very happy but i doubt it very much you be very hard of belief say candid i have live say martin you see those gondolier say candid be they not perpetually sing you do not see them say martin at home with their wife and brats the doge have hi trouble the gondolier have theirs it be true that all thing consider the life of a gondolier be preferable to that of a doge but i believe the difference to be so trifle that it be not worth the trouble of examine people talk say candid of the senator pococurante who live in that fine palace on the brenta where he entertain foreigner in the polite manner they pretend that this man have never felt any uneasiness i should be glad to see such a rarity say martin candid immediately send to ask the lord pococurante permission to wait upon him the next day the visit to lord pococurante a noble venetian candid and martin go in a gondola on the brenta and arrive at the palace of the noble signor pococurante the gardenlay out with taste be adorn with fine marble statues the palace be beautifully build the master of the house be a man of sixty and very rich he receive the two traveller with polite indifference which put candid a little out of countenance but be not at all disagreeable to martin first two pretty girls very neatly dress serve them with chocolate which be froth exceedingly well candid could not refrain from commend their beauty grace and address they be good enough creature say the senator i make them lie with me sometimes for i be very tired of the lady of the town of their coquetry of their jealousy of their quarrel of their humour of their pettiness of their pride of their folly and of the sonnet which one must make or have make for them but after all these two girl begin to weary me after breakfast candid walk into a long gallery be surprise by the beautiful picture he ask by what master be the two first they be by raphael say the senator i buy them at a great price out of vanity some year ago they be say to be the fine thing in italy but they do not please me at all the colour be too dark the figure be not sufficiently round nor in good relief the drapery in no way resemble stuff in a word whatever may be say i do not find there a true imitation of nature i only care for a picture when i think i see nature itself and there be none of this sort i have a great many picture but i prize them very little while they be wait for dinner pococurante order a concert candid find the music delicious this noise say the senator may amuse one for half an hour but if it be to last long it would grow tiresome to everybody though they durst not own it music today be only the art of execute difficult thing and that which be only difficult can not please long perhaps i should be fond of the opera if they have not find the secret of make of it a monster which shock me let who will go to see bad tragedy set to music where the scene be contrive for no other end than to introduce two or three song ridiculously out of place to show off an actresss voice let who will or who can die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quaver the rle of csar or of cato and strut awkwardly upon the stage for my part i have long since renounce those paltry entertainment which constitute the glory of modern italy and be purchase so dearly by sovereign candid dispute the point a little but with discretion martin be entirely of the senator opinion they sit down to table and after an excellent dinner they go into the library candid see a homer magnificently bind commend the virtuoso on hi good taste there say he be a book that be once the delight of the great pangloss the best philosopher in germany it be not mine answer pococurante coolly they use at one time to make me believe that i take a pleasure in read him but that continual repetition of battle so extremely like one another those god that be always active without do anything decisive that helen who be the cause of the war and who yet scarcely appear in the piece that troy so long besiege without be take all these together cause me great weariness i have sometimes ask learn men whether they be not as weary a i of that work those who be sincere have own to me that the poem make them fall asleep yet it be necessary to have it in their library a a monument of antiquity or like those rusty medal which be no long of use in commerce but your excellency do not think thus of virgil say candid i grant say the senator that the second fourth and sixth book of hi neid be excellent but a for hi pious neas hi strong cloanthus hi friend achates hi little ascanius hi silly king latinus hi bourgeois amata hi insipid lavinia i think there can be nothing more flat and disagreeable i prefer tasso a good deal or even the soporific tale of ariosto may i presume to ask you sir say candid whether you do not receive a great deal of pleasure from read horace there be maxim in this writer answer pococurante from which a man of the world may reap great benefit and be write in energetic verse they be more easily impress upon the memory but i care little for hi journey to brundusium and hi account of a bad dinner or of hi low quarrel between one rupilius whose word he say be full of poisonous filth and another whose language be imbue with vinegar i have read with much distaste hi indelicate verse against old woman and witch nor do i see any merit in tell hi friend mcenas that if he will but rank him in the choir of lyric poet hi lofty head shall touch the star fool admire everything in an author of reputation for my part i read only to please myself i like only that which serve my purpose candid have be educate never to judge for himself be much surprise at what he hear martin find there be a good deal of reason in pococurantes remark oh here be cicero say candid here be the great man whom i fancy you be never tire of read i never read him reply the venetian what be it to me whether he plead for rabirius or cluentius i try cause enough myself hi philosophical work seem to me good but when i find that he doubt of everything i conclude that i know as much a he and that i have no need of a guide to learn ignorance ha here be fourscore volume of the academy of science cry martin perhaps there be something valuable in this collection there might be say pococurante if only one of those rakers of rubbish have show how to make pin but in all these volume there be nothing but chimerical system and not a single useful thing and what dramatic work i see here say candid in italian spanish and french yes reply the senator there be three thousand and not three dozen of them good for anything a to those collection of sermon which altogether be not worth a single page of seneca and those huge volume of theology you may well imagine that neither i nor any one els ever open them martin saw some shelf fill with english book i have a notion say he that a republican must be greatly please with most of these book which be write with a spirit of freedom yes answer pococurante it be noble to write a one think this be the privilege of humanity in all our italy we write only what we do not think those who inhabit the country of the csars and the antoninus dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a dominican friar i should be please with the liberty which inspire the english genius if passion and party spirit do not corrupt all that be estimable in this precious liberty candid observe a milton ask whether he do not look upon this author a a great man who say pococurante that barbarian who write a long commentary in ten book of harsh verse on the first chapter of genesis that coarse imitator of the greek who disfigure the creation and who while moses represent the eternal produce the world by a word make the messiah take a great pair of compass from the armoury of heaven to circumscribe hi work how can i have any esteem for a writer who have spoil tasso hell and the devil who transform lucifer sometimes into a toad and other time into a pigmy who make him repeat the same thing a hundred time who make him dispute on theology who by a serious imitation of ariostos comic invention of firearm represent the devil cannonade in heaven neither i nor any man in italy could take pleasure in those melancholy extravagance and the marriage of sin and death and the snake bring forth by sin be enough to turn the stomach of any one with the least taste and hi long description of a pesthouse be good only for a gravedigger this obscure whimsical and disagreeable poem be despise upon it first publication and i only treat it now a it be treat in it own country by contemporary for the matter of that i say what i think and i care very little whether other think a i do candid be grieve at this speech for he have a respect for homer and be fond of milton ala say he softly to martin i be afraid that this man hold our german poet in very great contempt there would not be much harm in that say martin oh what a superior man say candid below hi breath what a great genius be this pococurante nothing can please him after their survey of the library they go down into the gardenwhere candid praise it several beauty i know of nothing in so bad a taste say the master all you see here be merely trifle after tomorrow i will have it plant with a nobler design well say candid to martin when they have take their leave you will agree that this be the happiest of mortal for he be above everything he possess but do you not see answered martin that he be disgust with all he possess plato observe a long while ago that those stomach be not the best that reject all sort of food but be there not a pleasure say candid in criticise everything in point out fault where other see nothing but beauty that be to say replied martin that there be some pleasure in have no pleasure well well say candid i find that i shall be the only happy man when i be bless with the sight of my dear cunegonde it be always well to hope say martin however the day and the week pass cacambo do not come and candid be so overwhelmed with grief that he do not even reflect that paquette and friar girofle do not return to thank him of a supper which candid and martin took with six stranger and who they were one evening that candid and martin be go to sit down to supper with some foreigner who lodge in the same inn a man whose complexion be as black a soot come behind candid and take him by the arm say get yourself ready to go along with u do not fail upon this he turn round and sawcacambo nothing but the sight of cunegonde could have astonish and delight him more he be on the point of go mad with joy he embrace hi dear friend cunegonde be here without doubt where be she take me to her that i may die of joy in her company cunegonde be not here say cacambo she be at constantinople oh heavens at constantinople but be she in china i would fly thither let u be off we shall set out after supper reply cacambo i can tell you nothing more i be a slave my master awaits me i must serve him at table speak not a word eat and then get ready candid distract between joy and grief delight at see hi faithful agent again astonish at find him a slave fill with the fresh hope of recover hi mistress hi heart palpitate hi understanding confuse sit down to table with martin who saw all these scene quite unconcerned and with six stranger who have come to spend the carnival at venice cacambo wait at table upon one of the stranger towards the end of the entertainment he draw near hi master and whisper in hi ear sire your majesty may start when you please the vessel be ready on say these word he go out the company in great surprise look at one another without speak a word when another domestic approach hi master and say to him sire your majesty chaise be at padua and the boat be ready the master give a nod and the servant go away the company all star at one another again and their surprise redouble a third valet come up to a third stranger say sire believe me your majesty ought not to stay here any long i be go to get everything ready and immediately he disappear candid and martin do not doubt that this be a masquerade of the carnival then a fourth domestic say to a fourth master your majesty may depart when you please say this he go away like the rest the fifth valet say the same thing to the fifth master but the sixth valet speak differently to the sixth stranger who sit near candid he say to him faith sire they will no longer give credit to your majesty nor to me and we may perhaps both of u be put in jail this very night therefore i will take care of myself adieu the servant be all go the six stranger with candid and martin remain in a profound silence at length candid break it gentleman say he this be a very good joke indeed but why should you all be king for me i own that neither martin nor i be a king cacambos master then gravely answer in italian i

five king listen to this speech with generous compassion each of them give twenty sequin to king theodore to buy him clothes and linen and candid make him a present of a diamond worth two thousand sequin who can this private person be say the five king to one another who be able to give and really have give a hundred time as much a any of u just a they rise from table in come four serene highness who have also be strip of their territory by the fortune of war and be come to spend the carnival at venice but candid pay no regard to these newcomer hi thought be entirely employ on hi voyage to constantinople in search of hi beloved cunegonde candid voyage to constantinople the faithful cacambo have already prevail upon the turkish skipper who be to conduct the sultan achmet to constantinople to receive candid and martin on hi ship they both embark after have make their obeisance to hi miserable highness you see say candid to martin on the way we sup with six dethroned king

martin yet once more pangloss be right all be for the best i wish it answer martin but say candid it be a very strange adventure we meet with at venice it have never before be see or hear that six dethrone king have sup together at a public inn it be not more extraordinary say martin than most of the thing that have happen to u it be a very common thing for king to be dethrone and a for the honour we have have of sup in their company it be a trifle not worth our attention no sooner have candid get on board the vessel than he fly to hi old valet and friend cacambo and tenderly embrace him well say he what news of cunegonde is she still a prodigy of beauty doe she love me still how be she thou hast doubtless buy her a palace at constantinople my dear master answer cacambo cunegonde wash

a day in hi exile but what be bad still be that she have lose her beauty and have become horribly ugly well handsome or ugly replied candid i be a man of honour and it be my duty to love her still but how come she to be reduce to so abject a state with the five or six million that you take to her ah say cacambo be i not to give two million to senor don fernando dibaraa y figueora y mascarenes y lampourdos y souza governor of buenos ayr for permit miss cunegonde to come away and do not a corsair bravely rob u of all the rest did not this corsair carry u to cape matapan to milo to nicaria to

sultan achmet the emperor ivan king charles edward or i how should i know answered martin i must see into your heart to be able to tell ah say candid if pangloss be here he could tell i know not say martin in what sort of scale your pangloss would weigh the misfortune of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrow all that i can presume to say be that there be million of people upon earth who have a hundred time more to complain of than king charles edward the emperor ivan or the sultan achmet that may well be say candid in a few day they reach the bosphorus and candid begin by pay a very

angry and see that i be a christian he call out for help they carry me before the cadi who order me a hundred lash on the sol of the foot and send me to the galley i be chain to the very same galley and the same bench a the young baron on board this galley there be four young men from marseille five neapolitan priest and two monk from corfu who tell u similar adventure happen daily the baron maintain that he have suffer great injustice than i and i insist that it be far more innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman bosom than to be find stark naked with an ichoglan we be continually dispute and receive twenty lash with a bull pizzle when the concatenation of universal event bring you to our galley and you be good enough to ransom u well my dear pangloss say candid to him when you have be hang dissect whipped and be tug at the oar do you always think that everything happens for the best i be still of my first opinion answer pangloss for i be a philosopher and i can not retract especially a leibnitz could never be wrong and besides the preestablished harmony be the fine thing in the world and so be hi plenum and materia subtilis how candid found cunegonde and the old woman again while candid the baron pangloss martin and cacambo be relate their several adventure be reason on the contingent or noncontingent event of the universe disputing on effect and cause on moral and physical evil on liberty and necessity and on the consolation a slave may feel even on a turkish galley they arrive at the house of the transylvanian prince on the bank of the propontis the first object which meet their sight be cunegonde and the old woman hang towel out to dry the baron pal at this sight the tender love candid see hi beautiful cunegonde embrown with bloodshot eye wither neck wrinkle cheek and rough red arm recoil three pace seize with horror and then advance out of good manner she embrace candid and her brother they embrace the old woman and candid ransom them both there be a small farm in the neighbourhood which the old woman propose to candid to make a shift with till the company could be provide for in a good manner cunegonde do not know she have grow ugly for nobody have tell her of it and she remind candid of hi promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her he therefore intimate to the baron that he intend marry hi sister i will not suffer say the baron such meanness on her part and such insolence on yours i will never be reproach with this scandalous thing my sister child would never be able to enter the church in germany no my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire cunegonde flung herself at hi foot and bath them with her tear still he be inflexible thou foolish fellow say candid i have deliver thee out of the galley i have pay thy ransom and thy sister also she be a scullion and be very ugly yet i be so condescending a to marry her and dost thou pretend to oppose the match i should kill thee again be i only to consult my anger thou mayest kill me again say the baron but thou shalt not marry my sister at least whilst i be live the conclusion at the bottom of hi heart candid have no wish to marry cunegonde but the extreme impertinence of the baron determine him to conclude the match and cunegonde press him so strongly that he could not go from hi word he consult pangloss martin and the faithful cacambo pangloss draw up an excellent memorial wherein he prove that the baron have no right over hi sister and that accord to all the law of the empire she might marry candid with her left hand martin be for throw the baron into the sea cacambo decide that it would be good to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley after which they think to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship this advice be well receive the old woman approve it they say not a word to hi sister the thing be execute for a little money and they have the double pleasure of entrap a jesuit and punish the pride of a german baron it be natural to imagine that after so many disaster candid marry and live with the philosopher pangloss the philosopher martin the prudent cacambo and the old woman have besides bring so many diamond from the country of the ancient inca must have lead a very happy life but he be so much impose upon by the jew that he have nothing leave except hi small farm hi wife become ugly every day more peevish and unsupportable the old woman be infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde cacambo who work in the gardenand take vegetable for sale to constantinople be fatigue with hard work and curse hi destiny pangloss be in despair at not shin in some german university for martin he be firmly persuade that he would be a badly off elsewhere and therefore bore thing patiently candid martin and pangloss sometimes dispute about moral and metaphysics they often saw pass under the window of their farm boat full of effendi pasha and cadis who be go into banishment to lemnos mitylene or erzeroum and they saw other cadis pasha and effendi come to supply the place of the exile and afterwards exile in their turn they saw head decently impale for presentation to the sublime porte such spectacle a these increase the number of their dissertation and when they do not dispute time hung so heavily upon their hand that one day the old woman venture to say to them i want to know which be bad to be ravish a hundred time by negro pirate to have a buttock cut off to run the gauntlet among the bulgarian to be whip and hang at an autodaf to be dissect to row in the galleysin short to go through all the misery we have undergone or to stay here and have nothing to do it be a great question say candid this discourse give rise to new reflection and martin especially conclude that man be bear to live either in a state of distract inquietude or of lethargic disgust candid do not quite agree to that but he affirm nothing pangloss own that he have always suffer horribly but a he have once assert that everything go wonderfully well he assert it still though he no longer believe it what help to confirm martin in hi detestable principle to stagger candid more than ever and to puzzle pangloss be that one day they saw paquette and friar girofle land at the farm in extreme misery they have soon squander their three thousand piastre part be reconcile quarrelled again be throw into gaol have escape and friar girofle have at length become turk paquette continue her trade wherever she go but make nothing of it i foresee say martin to candid that your present would soon be dissipate and only make them the more miserable you have roll in million of money you and cacambo and yet you be not happy than friar girofle and paquette ha say pangloss to paquette providence have then bring you amongst u again my poor child do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose an eye and an ear a you may see what a world be this and now this new adventure set them philosophise more than ever in the neighbourhood there live a very famous dervish who be esteem the best philosopher in all turkey and they go to consult him pangloss be the speaker master say he we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal a man be make with what meddlest thou say the dervish be it thy business but reverend father say candid there be horrible evil in this world what signify it say the dervish whether there be evil or good when hi highness send a ship to egypt do he trouble hi head whether the mouse on board be at their ease or not what then must we do say pangloss hold your tongue answer the dervish i be in hope say pangloss that i should reason with you a little about cause and effect about the best of possible world the origin of evil the nature of the soul and the preestablished harmony at these word the dervish shut the door in their face during this conversation the news be spread that two vizier and the mufti have be strangle at constantinople and that several of their friend have be impale this catastrophe make a great noise for some hour pangloss candid and martin return to the little farm saw a good old man take the fresh air at hi door under an orange bower pangloss who be as inquisitive a he be argumentative ask the old man what be the name of the strangled mufti i do not know answer the worthy man and i have not know the name of any mufti nor of any vizier i be entirely ignorant of the event you mention i presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affair die sometimes miserably and that they deserve it but i never trouble my head about what be transact at constantinople i content myself with send there for sale the fruit of the gardenwhich i cultivate have say these word he invite the stranger into hi house hi two son and two daughter present them with several sort of sherbet which they make themselves with kaimak enrich with the candiedpeel of citron with orange lemon pineapple pistachionuts and mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of batavia or the american island after which the two daughter of the honest mussulman perfume the stranger beard you must have a vast and magnificent estate say candid to the turk i have only twenty acre reply the old man i and my child cultivate them our labour preserve u from three great evilsweariness vice and want candid on hi way home make profound reflection on the old man conversation this honest turk say he to pangloss and martin seem to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six king with whom we have the honour of sup grandeur say pangloss be extremely dangerous accord to the testimony of philosopher for in short eglon king of moab be assassinate by ehud absalom be hang by hi hair and pierce with three dart king nadab the son of jeroboam be kill by baasa king ela by zimri ahaziah by jehu athaliah by jehoiada the king jehoiakim jeconiah and zedekiah be lead into captivity you know how perished crsus astyages darius dionysius of syracuse pyrrhus perseus hannibal jugurtha ariovistus csar pompey nero otho vitellius domitian richard ii of england edward ii henry vi richard iii mary stuart charles i the three henry of france the emperor henry iv you know i know also say candid that we must cultivate our gardenyou be right say pangloss for when man be first place in the gardenof eden he be put there ut operaretur eum that he might cultivate it which show that man be not bear to be idle let u work say martin without dispute it be the only way to render life tolerable the whole little society enter into this laudable design accord to their different ability their little plot of land produce plentiful crop cunegonde be indeed very ugly but she become an excellent pastry cook paquette work at embroidery the old woman look after the linen they be all not except friar girofle of some service or other for he make a good joiner and become a very honest man pangloss sometimes say to candid there be a concatenation of event in this best of all possible world for if you have not be kick out of a magnificent castle for love of miss cunegonde if you have not be put into the inquisition if you have not walk over america if you have not stab the baron if you have not lose all your sheep from the fine country of el dorado you would not be here eat preserve citron and pistachionuts all that be very well answered candid but let u cultivate our garden
