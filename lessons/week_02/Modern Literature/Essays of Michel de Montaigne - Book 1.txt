the most usual way of appease the indignation of such a we have any way offend when we see them in possession of the power of revenge and find that we absolutely lie at their mercy be by submission to move them to commiseration and pity and yet bravery constancy and resolution however quite contrary mean have sometimes serve to produce the same effect edward prince of wale the same who so long governed our guienne a personage whose condition and fortune have in them a great deal of the most notable and most considerable part of grandeur have be highly incense by the limousin and take their city by assault be not either by the cry of the people or the prayer and tear of the woman and child abandon to slaughter and prostrate at hi foot for mercy to be stay from prosecute hi revenge till penetrate far into the town he at last take notice of three french gentleman who with incredible bravery alone sustain the power of hi victorious army then it be that consideration and respect unto so remarkable a valour first stop the torrent of hi fury and that hi clemency begin with these three cavalier be afterwards extend to all the remain inhabitant of the city scanderbeg prince of epirus pursue one of hi soldier with purpose to kill him the soldier have in vain try by all the way of humility and supplication to appease him resolve a hi last refuge to face about and await him sword in hand which behaviour of hi give a sudden stop to hi captain fury who for see him assume so notable a resolution receive him into grace an example however that might suffer another interpretation with such a have not read of the prodigious force and valour of that prince the emperor conrad iii have besiege guelph duke of bavaria would not be prevail upon what mean and unmanly satisfaction soever be tender to him to condescend to milder condition than that the lady and gentlewoman only who be in the town with the duke might go out without violation of their honour on foot and with so much only a they could carry about them whereupon they out of magnanimity of heart presently contrive to carry out upon their shoulder their husband and child and the duke himself a sight at which the emperor be so pleased that ravish with the generosity of the action he weep for joy and immediately extinguish in hi heart the mortal and capital hatred he have conceive against this duke he from that time forward treat him and hi with all humanity the one and the other of these two way would with great facility work upon my nature for i have a marvellous propensity to mercy and mildness and to such a degree that i fancy of the two i should sooner surrender my anger to compassion than to esteem and yet pity be repute a vice amongst the stoic who will that we succour the afflict but not that we should be so affected with their suffering a to suffer with them i conceive these example not ill suit to the question in hand and the rather because therein we observe these great soul assault and try by these two several way to resist the one without relent and to be shake and subject by the other it may be true that to suffer a man heart to be totally subdue by compassion may be impute to facility effeminacy and overtenderness whence it come to pass that the weak nature a of woman child and the common sort of people be the most subject to it but after have resist and disdain the power of groan and tear to yield to the sole reverence of the sacred image of valour this can be no other than the effect of a strong and inflexible soul enamour of and honour masculine and obstinate courage nevertheless astonishment and admiration may in less generous mind beget a like effect witness the people of thebe who have put two of their general upon trial for their life for have continue in arm beyond the precise term of their commission very hardly pardon pelopidas who bow under the weight of so dangerous an accusation make no manner of defence for himself nor produce other argument than prayer and supplication whereas on the contrary epaminondas fall to recount magniloquently the exploit he have perform in their service and after a haughty and arrogant manner reproach them with ingratitude and injustice they have not the heart to proceed any further in hi trial but break up the court and depart the whole assembly highly commend the high courage of this personage dionysius the elder after have by a tedious siege and through exceed great difficulty take the city of reggio and in it the governor phyton a very gallant man who have make so obstinate a defence be resolve to make him a tragical example of hi revenge in order whereunto he first tell him that he have the day before cause hi son and all hi kindred to be drown to which phyton return no other answer but this that they be then by one day happy than he after which cause him to be strip and deliver him into the hand of the tormentor he be by them not only drag through the street of the town and most ignominiously and cruelly whip but moreover vilify with most bitter and contumelious language yet still he maintain hi courage entire all the way with a strong voice and undaunted countenance proclaim the honourable and glorious cause of hi death namely for that he would not deliver up hi country into the hand of a tyrant at the same time denounce against him a speedy chastisement from the offended god at which dionysius reading in hi soldier look that instead of be incense at the haughty language of this conquered enemy to the contempt of their captain and hi triumph they be not only strike with admiration of so rare a virtue but moreover incline to mutiny and be even ready to rescue the prisoner out of the hangman hand he cause the torturing to cease and afterwards privately cause him to be throw into the sea man in good earnest be a marvellous vain fickle and unstable subject and on whom it be very hard to form any certain and uniform judgment for pompey could pardon the whole city of the mamertines though furiously incense against it upon the single account of the virtue and magnanimity of one citizen zeno who take the fault of the public wholly upon himself neither entreat other favour but alone to undergo the punishment for all and yet syllas host have in the city of perugia manifest the same virtue obtain nothing by it either for himself or hi fellowcitizens and directly contrary to my first examples the brave of all men and who be repute so gracious to all those he overcame alexander have after many great difficulty force the city of gaza and enter find betis who command there and of whose valour in the time of this siege he have most marvellous manifest proof alone forsake by all hi soldier hi armour hack and hew to piece cover all over with blood and wound and yet still fight in the crowd of a number of macedonian who be lay on him on all side he say to him nettle at so dearbought a victory for in addition to the other damage he have two wound newly receive in hi own person thou shalt not die betis a thou dost intend be sure thou shall suffer all the torment that can be inflict on a captive to which menace the other return no other answer but only a fierce and disdainful look what say alexander observe hi haughty and obstinate silence be he too stiff to bend a knee be he too proud to utter one suppliant word truly i will conquer this silence and if i can not force a word from hi mouth i will at least extract a groan from hi heart and thereupon convert hi anger into fury presently command hi heel to be bore through cause him alive to be drag mangled and dismember at a cart tail be it that the height of courage be so natural and familiar to this conqueror that because he could not admire he respect it the less or be it that he conceive valour to be a virtue so peculiar to himself that hi pride could not without envy endure it in another or be it that the natural impetuosity of hi fury be incapable of opposition certainly have it be capable of moderation it be to be believe that in the sack and desolation of thebe to see so many valiant men lose and totally destitute of any further defence cruelly massacre before hi eye would have appease it where there be above six thousand put to the sword of whom not one be see to fly or hear to cry out for quarter but on the contrary every one running here and there to seek out and to provoke the victorious enemy to help them to an honourable end not one be see who however weaken with wound do not in hi last gasp yet endeavour to revenge himself and with all the arm of a brave despair to sweeten hi own death in the death of an enemy yet do their valour create no pity and the length of one day be not enough to satiate the thirst of the conqueror revenge but the slaughter continue to the last drop of blood that be capable of be shed and stop not till it meet with none but unarmed person old men woman and child of them to carry away to the number of thirty thousand slave no man living be more free from this passion than i who yet neither like it in myself nor admire it in other and yet generally the world a a settled thing be please to grace it with a particular esteem clothing therewith wisdom virtue and conscience foolish and sordid guise the italian have more fitly baptize by this name malignity for ti a quality always hurtful always idle and vain and a be cowardly mean and base it be by the stoic expressly and particularly forbidden to their sage but the story say that psammenitus king of egypt be defeat and take prisoner by cambyses king of persia see hi own daughter pas by him a prisoner and in a wretched habit with a bucket to draw water though hi friend about him be so concerned a to break out into tear and lamentation yet he himself remain unmoved without utter a word hi eye fix upon the ground and see moreover hi son immediately after lead to execution still maintain the same countenance till spy at last one of hi domestic and familiar friend drag away amongst the captive he fell to tear hi hair and beat hi breast with all the other extravagance of extreme sorrow a story that may very fitly be couple with another of the same kind of recent date of a prince of our own nation who be at trent and have news there bring him of the death of hi elder brother a brother on whom depend the whole support and honour of hi house and soon after of that of a young brother the second hope of hi family and have withstand these two assault with an exemplary resolution one of hi servant happen a few day after to die he suffer hi constancy to be overcome by this last accident and part with hi courage so abandon himself to sorrow and mourn that some thence be forward to conclude that he be only touch to the quick by this last stroke of fortune but in truth it be that be before brimful of grief the least addition overflow the bound of all patience which i think might also be say of the former example do not the story proceed to tell u that cambyses ask psammenitus why not be move at the calamity of hi son and daughter he should with so great impatience bear the misfortune of hi friend it be answer he because only this last affliction be to be manifest by tear the two first far exceed all manner of expression and peradventure something like this might be work in the fancy of the ancient painter who have in the sacrifice of iphigenia to represent the sorrow of the assistant proportion to the several degree of interest every one have in the death of this fair innocent virgin and have in the other figure lay out the utmost power of hi art when he come to that of her father he draw him with a veil over hi face meaning thereby that no kind of countenance be capable of express such a degree of sorrow which be also the reason why the poet feign the miserable mother niobe have first lose seven son and then afterwards a many daughter overwhelm with her loss to have be at last transform into a rock thereby to express that melancholic dumb and deaf stupefaction which benumb all our faculty when oppress with accident great than we be able to bear and indeed the violence and impression of an excessive grief must of necessity astonish the soul and wholly deprive her of her ordinary function a it happen to every one of u who upon any sudden alarm of very ill news find ourselves surprise stupefy and in a manner deprive of all power of motion so that the soul begin to vent itself in tear and lamentation seem to free and disengage itself from the sudden oppression and to have obtain some room to work itself out at great liberty in the war that ferdinand make upon the widow of king john of hungary about buda a manatarms be particularly take notice of by every one for hi singular gallant behaviour in a certain encounter and unknown highly commend and lament be leave dead upon the place but by none so much a by raisciac a german lord who be infinitely enamour of so rare a valour the body be bring off and the count with the common curiosity come to view it the armour be no sooner take off but he immediately know him to be hi own son a thing that add a second blow to the compassion of all the beholder only he without utter a word or turn away hi eye from the woeful object stand fixedly contemplate the body of hi son till the vehemency of sorrow have overcome hi vital spirit make him sink down stonedead to the ground say the innamoratos when they would represent an insupportable passion neither be it in the height and great fury of the fit that we be in a condition to pour out our complaint or our amorous persuasion the soul be at that time overburden and labour with profound thought and the body deject and languish with desire and thence it be that sometimes proceed those accidental impotency that so unseasonably surprise the lover and that frigidity which by the force of an immoderate ardour seize him even in the very lap of fruition for all passion that suffer themselves to be relish and digest be but moderate a surprise of unexpected joy do likewise often produce the same effect besides the example of the roman lady who die for joy to see her son safe return from the defeat of cannae and of sophocles and of dionysius the tyrant who die of joy and of thalna who die in corsica read news of the honour the roman senate have decree in hi favour we have moreover one in our time of pope leo x who upon news of the taking of milan a thing he have so ardently desire be rapt with so sudden an excess of joy that he immediately fell into a fever and die and for a more notable testimony of the imbecility of human nature it be record by the ancient that diodorus the dialectician die upon the spot out of an extreme passion of shame for not have be able in hi own school and in the presence of a great auditory to disengage himself from a nice argument that be propound to him i for my part be very little subject to these violent passion i be naturally of a stubborn apprehension which also by reason i every day harden and fortify such a accuse mankind of the folly of gap after future thing and advise u to make our benefit of those which be present and to set up our rest upon them a have no grasp upon that which be to come even less than that which we have upon what be past have hit upon the most universal of human error if that may be call an error to which nature herself have dispose u in order to the continuation of her own work prepossess u amongst several other with this deceive imagination a be more jealous of our action than afraid of our knowledge we be never present with but always beyond ourselves fear desire hope still push u on towards the future deprive u in the meantime of the sense and consideration of that which be to amuse u with the thought of what shall be even when we shall be no more we find this great precept often repeat in plato do thine own work and know thyself of which two part both the one and the other generally comprehend our whole duty and do each of them in like manner involve the other for who will do hi own work aright will find that hi first lesson be to know what he be and that which be proper to himself and who rightly understand himself will never mistake another man work for hi own but will love and improve himself above all other thing will refuse superfluous employment and reject all unprofitable thought and proposition a folly on the one side though it should enjoy all it desire would notwithstanding never be content so on the other wisdom acquiesce in the present be never dissatisfy with itself epicurus dispense hi sage from all foresight and care of the future amongst those law that relate to the dead i look upon that to be very sound by which the action of prince be to be examine after their decease they be equal with if not master of the law and therefore what justice could not inflict upon their person ti but reason should be execute upon their reputation and the estate of their successorsthings that we often value above life itself tis a custom of singular advantage to those country where it be in use and by all good prince to be desire who have reason to take it ill that the memory of the wicked should be use with the same reverence and respect with their own we owe subjection and obedience to all our king whether good or bad alike for that have respect unto their office but a to esteem and affection these be only due to their virtue let u grant to political government to endure them with patience however unworthy to conceal their vice and to assist them with our recommendation in their indifferent action whilst their authority stand in need of our support but the relation of prince and subject be once at an end there be no reason we should deny the expression of our real opinion to our own liberty and common justice and especially to interdict to good subject the glory of have reverently and faithfully serve a prince whose imperfection be to them so well know this be to deprive posterity of a useful example and such a out of respect to some private obligation unjustly espouse and vindicate the memory of a faulty prince do private right at the expense of public justice livy do very truly say that the language of men breed up in court be always full of vain ostentation and false testimony every one indifferently magnify hi own master and stretch hi commendation to the utmost extent of virtue and sovereign grandeur some may condemn the freedom of those two soldier who so roundly answered nero to hi beard the one be ask by him why he bore him illwill i love thee answer he whilst thou wert worthy of it but since thou art become a parricide an incendiary a player and a coachman i hate thee a thou dost deserve and the other why he should attempt to kill him because say he i could think of no other remedy against thy perpetual mischief but the public and universal testimony that be give of him after hi death and so will be to all posterity both of him and all other wicked prince like him of hi tyranny and abominable deportment who of a sound judgment can reprove them i be scandalise that in so sacred a government a that of the lacedaemonians there should be mix so hypocritical a ceremony at the interment of their king where all their confederate and neighbour and all sort and degree of men and woman as well a their slave cut and slash their forehead in token of sorrow repeat in their cry and lamentation that that king let him have be as wicked a the devil be the best that ever they have by this mean attribute to hi quality the praise that only belong to merit and that of right be due to supreme desert though lodge in the low and most inferior subject aristotle who will still have a hand in everything make a quaere upon the saying of solon that none can be say to be happy until he be dead whether then he who have live and die accord to hi heart desire if he have leave an ill repute behind him and that hi posterity be miserable can be say to be happy whilst we have life and motion we convey ourselves by fancy and preoccupation whither and to what we please but once out of be we have no more any manner of communication with that which be and it have therefore be well say by solon that man be never happy because never so till he be no more bertrand de guesclin die at the siege of the castle of rancon near unto puy in auvergne the besiege be afterwards upon surrender enjoin to lay down the key of the place upon the corpse of the dead general bartolommeo dalviano the venetian general happen to die in the service of the republic in brescia and hi corpse be to be carry through the territory of verona an enemys country most of the army be incline to demand safeconduct from the veronese but theodoro trivulzio oppose the motion rather choose to make hi way by force of arm and to run the hazard of a battle say it be by no mean fit that he who in hi life be never afraid of hi enemy should seem to apprehend them when he be dead in truth in affair of the same nature by the greek law he who make suit to an enemy for a body to give it burial renounce hi victory and have no more right to erect a trophy and he to whom such suit be make be repute victor by this mean it be that nicias lose the advantage he have visibly obtain over the corinthian and that agesilaus on the contrary assure that which he have before very doubtfully gain over the boeotian these thing might appear strange have it not be a general practice in all age not only to extend the concern of ourselves beyond this life but moreover to fancy that the favour of heaven do not only very often accompany u to the grave but have also even after life a concern for our ash of which there be so many ancient example to say nothing of those of our own observation that it be not necessary i should longer insist upon it edward i king of england have in the long war betwixt him and robert king of scotland have experience of how great importance hi own immediate presence be to the success of hi affair have ever be victorious in whatever he undertake in hi own person when he come to die bound hi son in a solemn oath that so soon a he should be dead he should boil hi body till the flesh part from the bone and bury the flesh reserve the bone to carry continually with him in hi army so often a he should be oblige to go against the scot a if destiny have inevitably attach victory even to hi remains john zisca the same who to vindication of wicliffes heresy trouble the bohemian state leave order that they should flay him after hi death and of hi skin make a drum to carry in the war against hi enemy fancy it would contribute to the continuation of the success he have always obtain in the war against them in like manner certain of the indian in their battle with the spaniard carry with them the bone of one of their captain in consideration of the victory they have formerly obtain under hi conduct and other people of the same new world carry about with them in their war the relic of valiant men who have die in battle to incite their courage and advance their fortune of which examples the first reserve nothing for the tomb but the reputation they have acquire by their former achievement but these attribute to them a certain present and active power the proceeding of captain bayard be of a good composition who find himself wound to death with an harquebus shot and be importune to retire out of the fight make answer that he would not begin at the last gasp to turn hi back to the enemy and accordingly still fight on till feel himself too faint and no longer able to sit on hi horse he command hi steward to set him down at the foot of a tree but so that he might die with hi face towards the enemy which he do i must yet add another example equally remarkable for the present consideration with any of the former the emperor maximilian greatgrandfather to the now king philip be a prince endow throughout with great and extraordinary quality and amongst the rest with a singular beauty of person but have withal a humour very contrary to that of other prince who for the despatch of their most important affair convert their closestool into a chair of state which be that he would never permit any of hi bedchamber how familiar soever to see him in that posture and would steal aside to make water as religiously a a virgin shy to discover to hi physician or any other whomsoever those part that we be accustom to conceal i myself who have so impudent a way of talk be nevertheless naturally so modest this way that unless at the importunity of necessity or pleasure i scarcely ever communicate to the sight of any either those part or action that custom order u to conceal wherein i suffer more constraint than i conceive be very well become a man especially of my profession but he nourish this modest humour to such a degree of superstition a to give express order in hi last will that they should put him on drawer so soon a he should be dead to which methinks he would have do well to have add that he should be blindfold too that put them on the charge that cyrus leave with hi child that neither they nor any other should either see or touch hi body after the soul be depart from it i attribute to some superstitious devotion of hi for both hi historian and himself amongst their great quality mark the whole course of their life with a singular respect and reverence to religion i be by no mean please with a story tell me by a man of very great quality of a relation of mine and one who have give a very good account of himself both in peace and war that come to die in a very old age of excessive pain of the stone he spend the last hour of hi life in an extraordinary solicitude about order the honour and ceremony of hi funeral press all the men of condition who come to see him to engage their word to attend him to hi grave importune this very prince who come to visit him at hi last gasp with a most earnest supplication that he would order hi family to be there and present before him several reason and example to prove that it be a respect due to a man of hi condition and seem to die content have obtain this promise and appoint the method and order of hi funeral parade i have seldom hear of so persistent a vanity another though contrary curiosity of which singularity also i do not want domestic example seem to be somewhat akin to this that a man shall cudgel hi brain at the last moment of hi life to contrive hi obsequies to so particular and unusual a parsimony a of one servant with a lantern i see this humour commend and the appointment of marcus emilius lepidus who forbid hi heir to bestow upon hi hearse even the common ceremony in use upon such occasion be it yet temperance and frugality to avoid expense and pleasure of which the use and knowledge be imperceptible to u see here an easy and cheap reformation if instruction be at all necessary in this case i should be of opinion that in this a in all other action of life each person should regulate the matter accord to hi fortune and the philosopher lycon prudently order hi friend to dispose of hi body where they should think most fit and a to hi funeral to order it neither too superfluous nor too mean for my part i should wholly refer the ordering of this ceremony to custom and shall when the time come accordingly leave it to their discretion to whose lot it shall fall to do me that last office and it be a holy saying of a saint which make socrates answer crito who at death ask him how he would be bury how you will say he if i be to concern myself beyond the present about this affair i should be most tempt a the great satisfaction of this kind to imitate those who in their lifetime entertain themselves with the ceremony and honour of their own obsequies beforehand and be please with behold their own dead countenance in marble happy be they who can gratify their sens by insensibility and live by their death i be ready to conceive an implacable hatred against all popular domination though i think it the most natural and equitable of all so oft a i call to mind the inhuman injustice of the people of athens who without remission or once vouchsafe to hear what they have to say for themselves put to death their brave captain newly return triumphant from a naval victory they have obtain over the lacedaemonians near the arginusian isle the most bloody and obstinate engagement that ever the greek fought at sea because after the victory they follow up the blow and pursue the advantage present to them by the rule of war rather than stay to gather up and bury their dead and the execution be yet render more odious by the behaviour of diomedon who be one of the condemn and a man of most eminent virtue political and military after have hear the sentence advance to speak no audience till then have be allow instead of lay before them hi own cause or the impiety of so cruel a sentence only express a solicitude for hi judge preservation beseech the god to convert this sentence to their good and pray that for neglect to fulfil the vow which he and hi companion have make with which he also acquaint them in acknowledgment of so glorious a success they might not draw down the indignation of the god upon them and so without more word go courageously to hi death fortune a few year after punish them in the same kind for chabrias captaingeneral of their naval force have get the good of pollis admiral of sparta at the isle of naxos totally lose the fruit of hi victory one of very great importance to their affair in order not to incur the danger of this example and so that he should not lose a few body of hi dead friend that be float in the sea give opportunity to a world of live enemy to sail away in safety who afterwards make them pay dear for this unseasonable superstition this other restore the sense of repose to a body without a soul a nature demonstrate to u that several dead thing retain yet an occult relation to life wine change it flavour and complexion in cellar accord to the change and season of the vine from whence it come and the flesh ofvenison alter it condition in the powderingtub and it taste accord to the law of the living flesh of it kind a it be say a gentleman of my country marvellously torment with the gout be importune by hi physician totally to abstain from all manner of salt meat be wont pleasantly to reply that in the extremity of hi fit he must need have something to quarrel with and that rail at and curse one while the bologna sausage and another the dry tongue and the ham be some mitigation to hi pain but in good earnest a the arm when it be advance to strike if it miss the blow and go by the wind it pain u and a also that to make a pleasant prospect the sight should not be lose and dilate in vague air but have some bound and object to limit and circumscribe it at a reasonable distance so it seem that the soul be transport and discompose turn it violence upon itself if not supply with something to oppose it and therefore always require an object at which to aim and whereon to act plutarch say of those who be delight with little dog and monkey that the amorous part that be in u for want of a legitimate object rather than lie idle do after that manner forge and create one false and frivolous and we see that the soul in it passion incline rather to deceive itself by create a false and fantastical a subject even contrary to it own belief than not to have something to work upon after this manner brute beast direct their fury to fall upon the stone or weapon that have hurt them and

fault to right or wrong that we may have something to quarrel with it be not those beautiful tress you tear nor be it the white bosom that in your anger you so unmercifully beat that with an unlucky bullet have slay your beloved brother quarrel with something els livy speaking of the roman army in spain say that for the loss of the two brother their great captain tis a common practice and the philosopher bion say pleasantly of the king who by hands pull hi hair off hi head for sorrow doe this man think that baldness be a remedy for grief who have not see peevish gamest chew and swallow the card and swallow the dice in revenge for the loss of their money xerxes whip the sea and write a challenge to mount athos cyrus employ a whole army several day at work to revenge himself of the river gyndas for the fright it have put him into in pass over it and caligula demolish a very beautiful palace for the pleasure hi mother have once enjoy there i remember there be a story current when i be a boy that one of our neighbouring king have receive a blow from the hand of god swore he would be revenge and in order to it make proclamation that for ten year to come no one should pray to him or so much a mention him throughout hi dominion or so far a hi authority go believe in him by which they mean to paint not so much the folly a the vainglory of the nation of which this tale be tell they be vice that always go together but in truth such action a these have in them still more of presumption than want of wit augustus caesar have be toss with a tempest at sea fell to defy neptune and in the pomp of the circensian game to be revenge depose hi statue from the place it have amongst the other deity wherein he be still less excusable than the former and less than he be afterwards when have lose a battle under quintilius varus in germany in rage and despair he go run hi head against the wall cry out o varus give me back my legion for these exceed all folly forasmuch a impiety be join therewith invade god himself or at least fortune a if she have ear that be subject to our battery like the thracian who when it thunder or lighten fall to shoot against heaven with titanian vengeance a if by flight of arrow they intend to bring god to reason though the ancient poet in plutarch tell u but we can never enough decry the disorderly sally of our mind quintus marcius the roman legate in the war against perseus king of macedon to gain time wherein to reinforce hi army set on foot some overture of accommodation with which the king be lull asleep conclude a truce for some day by this mean give hi enemy opportunity and leisure to recruit hi force which be afterwards the occasion of the king final ruin yet the elder senator mindful of their forefather manner condemn this proceeding a degenerate from their ancient practice which they say be to fight by valour and not by artifice surprise and nightencounters neither by pretended flight nor unexpected rally to overcome their enemy never make war till have first proclaim it and very often assign both the hour and place of battle out of this generous principle it be that they deliver up to pyrrhus hi treacherous physician and to the etrurians their disloyal schoolmaster this be indeed a procedure truly roman and nothing ally to the grecian subtlety nor to the punic cunning where it be repute a victory of less glory to overcome by force than by fraud deceit may serve for a need but he only confess himself overcome who know he be neither subdue by policy nor misadventure but by dint of valour man to man in a fair and just war it very well appear by the discourse of these good old senator that this fine sentence be not yet receive amongst them the achaian say polybius abhor all manner of doubled in war not repute it a victory unless where the courage of the enemy be fairly subdue say another in the kingdom of ternate amongst those nation which we so broadly call barbarian they have a custom never to commence war till it be first proclaim add withal an ample declaration of what mean they have to do it with with what and how many men what ammunition and what both offensive and defensive arm but also that be do if their enemy do not yield and come to an agreement they conceive it lawful to employ without reproach in their war any mean which may help them to conquer the ancient florentine be so far from seek to obtain any advantage over their enemy by surprise that they always give them a month warn before they draw their army into the field by the continual tolling of a bell they call martinella for what concern ourselves who be not so scrupulous in this affair and who attribute the honour of the war to him who have the profit of it and who after lysander say where the lion skin be too short we must eke it out with a bit from that of a fox the most usual occasion of surprise be derive from this practice and we hold that there be no moment wherein a chief ought to be more circumspect and to have hi eye so much at watch a those of parley and treaty of accommodation and it be therefore become a general rule amongst the martial men of these latter time that a governor of a place never ought in a time of siege to go out to parley it be for this that in our father day the seigneur de montmord and de lassigni defend mousson against the count of nassau be so highly censure but yet a to this it would be excusable in that governor who go out should notwithstanding do it in such manner that the safety and advantage should be on hi side a count guido di rangone do at reggio if we be to believe du bellay for guicciardini say it be he himself when the seigneur de lescut approach to parley who step so little away from hi fort that a disorder happen in the interim of parley not only monsieur de lescut and hi party who be advance with him find themselves by much the weak insomuch that alessandro trivulcio be there slain but he himself follow the count and rely upon hi honour to secure himself from the danger of the shot within the wall of the town eumenes be shut up in the city of nora by antigonus and by him importune to come out to speak with him a he send him word it be fit he should to a great man than himself and one who have now an advantage over him return this noble answer tell him say he that i shall never think any man great than myself whilst i have my sword in my hand and would not consent to come out to him till first accord to hi own demand antigonus have deliver him hi own nephew ptolomeus in hostage and yet some have do very well in go out in person to parley on the word of the assailant witness henry de vaux a cavalier of champagne who be besiege by the english in the castle of commercy and bartholomew de brunes who command at the leaguer have so sap the great part of the castle without that nothing remain but set fire to the prop to bury the besiege under the ruin he request the say henry to come out to speak with him for hi own good which he do with three more in company and hi ruin be make apparent to him he conceive himself singularly oblige to hi enemy to whose discretion he and hi garrison surrender themselves and fire be presently apply to the mine the prop no sooner begin to fail but the castle be immediately blow up from it foundation no one stone be leave upon another i could and do with great facility rely upon the faith of another but i should very unwillingly do it in such a case a it should thereby be judge that it be rather an effect of my despair and want of courage than voluntarily and out of confidence and security in the faith of him with whom i have to do i saw notwithstanding lately at mussidan a place not far from my house that those who be drive out thence by our army and other of their party highly complain of treachery for that during a treaty of accommodation and in the very interim that their deputy be treat they be surprise and cut to piece a thing that peradventure in another age might have have some colour of foul play but a i have just say the practice of arm in these day be quite another thing and there be now no confidence in an enemy excusable till the treaty be finally seal and even then the conqueror have enough to do to keep hi word so hazardous a thing it be to entrust the observation of the faith a man have engage to a town that surrender upon easy and favourable condition to the licence of a victorious army and to give the soldier free entrance into it in the heat of blood lucius aemilius regillus the roman praetor have lose hi time in attempt to take the city of phocaea by force by reason of the singular valour wherewith the inhabitant defend themselves condition at last to receive them a friend to the people of rome and to enter the town a into a confederate city without any manner of hostility of which he give them all assurance but have for the great pomp bring hi whole army in with him it be no more in hi power with all the endeavour he could use to restrain hi people so that avarice and revenge trample under foot both hi authority and all military discipline he there saw a considerable part of the city sack and ruin before hi face cleomenes be wont to say that what mischief soever a man could do hi enemy in time of war be above justice and nothing accountable to it in the sight of god and men and so have conclude a truce with those of argo for seven day the third night after he fell upon them when they be all bury in sleep and put them to the sword allege that there have no night be mention in the truce but the god punish this subtle perfidy in a time of parley also and while the citizen be rely upon their safety warrant the city of casilinum be take by surprise and that even in the age of the justest captain and the most perfect roman military discipline for it be not say that it be not lawful for u in time and place to make advantage of our enemy want of understanding as well a their want of courage and doubtless war have naturally many privilege that appear reasonable even to the prejudice of reason and therefore here the rule fail but i be astonish at the great liberty allow by xenophon in such case and that both by precept and by the example of several exploit of hi complete emperor an author of very great authority i confess in those affair a be in hi own person both a great captain and a philosopher of the first form of socrates disciple and yet i can not consent to such a measure of licence a he dispense in all thing and place monsieur daubigny besiege capua and after have direct a furious battery against it signor fabricio colonna governor of the town have from a bastion begin to parley and hi soldier in the meantime be a little more remiss in their guard our people enter the place at unawares and put them all to the sword and of late memory at yvoy signor juliano romero have play that part of a novice to go out to parley with the constable at hi return find hi place take but that we might not scape scotfree the marquess of pescara have lay siege to genoa where duke ottaviano fregosa command under our protection and the article betwixt them be so far advanced that it be look upon a a do thing and upon the point to be conclude the spaniard in the meantime have slip in make use of this treachery a an absolute victory and since at ligny in barrois where the count de brienne command the emperor have in hi own person beleaguer that place and bertheville the say count lieutenant go out to parley whilst he be capitulate the town be take but the philosopher chrysippus be of another opinion wherein i also concur for he be use to say that those who run a race ought to employ all the force they have in what they be about and to run as fast a they can but that it be by no mean fair in them to lay any hand upon their adversary to stop him nor to set a leg before him to throw him down and yet more generous be the answer of that great alexander to polypercon who be persuade him to take the advantage of the night obscurity to fall upon darius by no mean say be it be not for such a man a i be to steal a victory malo me fortuna poeniteatquam victoria pudeat ti a say that death discharge u of all our obligation i know some who have take it in another sense henry vii king of england article with don philip son to maximilian the emperor or to place him more honourably father to the emperor charles v that the say philip should deliver up the duke of suffolk of the white rose hi enemy who be flee into the low country into hi hand which philip accordingly do but upon condition nevertheless that henry should attempt nothing against the life of the say duke but come to die the king in hi last will command hi son to put him to death immediately after hi decease and lately in the tragedy that the duke of alva present to u in the person of the count horn and egmont at brussels there be very remarkable passage and one amongst the rest that count egmont upon the security of whose word and faith count horn have come and surrender himself to the duke of alva earnestly entreat that he might first mount the scaffold to the end that death might disengage him from the obligation he have pass to the other in which case methinks death do not acquit the former of hi promise and that the second be discharge from it without die we can not be bind beyond what we be able to perform by reason that effect and performance be not at all in our power and that indeed we be master of nothing but the will in which by necessity all the rule and whole duty of mankind be found and establish therefore count egmont conceive hi soul and will indebted to hi promise although he have not the power to make it good have doubtless be absolve of hi duty even though he have outlive the other but the king of england wilfully and premeditately break hi faith be no more to be excuse for defer the execution of hi infidelity till after hi death than the mason in herodotus who have inviolably during the time of hi life keep the secret of the treasure of the king of egypt hi master at hi death discover it to hi child i have take notice of several in my time who convict by their conscience of unjustly detain the good of another have endeavour to make amends by their will and after their decease but they have a good do nothing a either in take so much time in so press an affair or in go about to remedy a wrong with so little dissatisfaction or injury to themselves they owe over and above something of their own and by how much their payment be more strict and incommodious to themselves by so much be their restitution more just meritorious penitency require penalty but they yet do bad than these who reserve the animosity against their neighbour to the last gasp have conceal it during their life wherein they manifest little regard of their own honour irritate the party offend in their memory and less to their the power even out of to make their malice die with them but extend the life of their hatred even beyond their own unjust judge who defer judgment to a time wherein they can have no knowledge of the cause for my part i shall take care if i can that my death discover nothing that my life have not first and openly declare a we see some ground that have long lain idle and untilled when grow rich and fertile by rest to abound with and spend their virtue in the product of innumerable sort of weed and wild herb that be unprofitable and that to make them perform their true office we be to cultivate and prepare them for such seed a be proper for our service and a we see woman that without knowledge of man do sometimes of themselves bring forth inanimate and formless lump of flesh but that to cause a natural and perfect generation they be to be husband with another kind of seed even so it be with mind which if not apply to some certain study that may fix and restrain them run into a thousand extravagance eternally rove here and there in the vague expanse of the imagination in which wild agitation there be no folly nor idle fancy they do not light upon the soul that have no establish aim lose itself for a it be say when i lately retire to my own house with a resolution as much a possibly i could to avoid all manner of concern in affair and to spend in privacy and repose the little remainder of time i have to live i fancy i could not more oblige my mind than to suffer it at full leisure to entertain and divert itself which i now hop it might henceforth do a be by time become more settled and mature but i find that quite contrary it be like a horse that have break from hi rider who voluntarily run into a much more violent career than any horseman would put him to and creates me so many chimaera and fantastic monster one upon another without order or design that the good at leisure to contemplate their strangeness and absurdity i have begin to commit them to write hop in time to make it ashamed of itself there be not a man live whom it would so little become to speak from memory a myself for i have scarcely any at all and do not think that the world have another so marvellously treacherous a mine my other faculty be all sufficiently ordinary and mean but in this i think myself very rare and singular and deserve to be think famous besides the natural inconvenience i suffer by it for cert the necessary use of memory consider plato have reason when he call it a great and powerful goddess in my country when they would say a man have no sense they say such an one have no memory and when i complain of the defect of mine they do not believe me and reprove me a though i accuse myself for a fool not discern the difference betwixt memory and understanding which be to make matter still bad for me but they do me wrong for experience rather daily show u on the contrary that a strong memory be commonly couple with infirm judgment they do me moreover who be so perfect in nothing a in friendship a great wrong in this that they make the same word which accuse my infirmity represent me for an ungrateful person they bring my affection into question upon the account of my memory and from a natural imperfection make out a defect of conscience he have forget say one this request or that promise he no more remembers hi friend he have forget to say or do or conceal such and such a thing for my sake and truly i be apt enough to forget many thing but to neglect anything my friend have give me in charge i never do it and it should be enough methinks that i feel the misery and inconvenience of it without brand me with malice a vice so contrary to my humour however i derive these comfort from my infirmity first that it be an evil from which principally i have find reason to correct a bad that would easily enough have grow upon me namely ambition the defect be intolerable in those who take upon them public affair that like example in the progress of nature demonstrate to u she have fortify me in my other faculty proportion a she have leave me unfurnished in this i should otherwise have be apt implicitly to have repose my mind and judgment upon the bare report of other men without ever set them to work upon their own force have the invention and opinion of other be ever be present with me by the benefit of memory that by this mean i be not so talkative for the magazine of the memory be ever well furnish with matter than that of the invention had mine be faithful to me i have ere this deafen all my friend with my babble the subject themselves arouse and stir up the little faculty i have of handling and employ them heat and distend my discourse which be a pity a i have observe in several of my intimate friend who a their memory supply them with an entire and full view of thing begin their narrative so far back and crowd it with so many impertinent circumstance that though the story be good in itself they make a shift to spoil it and if otherwise you be either to curse the strength of their memory or the weakness of their judgment and it be a hard thing to close up a discourse and to cut it short when you have once start there be nothing wherein the force of a horse be so much see a in a round and sudden stop i see even those who be pertinent enough who would but can not stop short in their career for whilst they be seek out a handsome period to conclude with they go on at random straggle about upon impertinent triviality a men stagger upon weak leg but above all old men who retain the memory of thing past and forget how often they have tell them be dangerous company and i have know story from the mouth of a man of very great quality otherwise very pleasant in themselves become very wearisome by be repeat a hundred time over and over again to the same people secondly that by this mean i the less remember the injury i have receive insomuch that a the ancient say i should have a register of injury or a prompter a darius who that he might not forget the offence he have receive from those of athens so oft a he sit down to dinner ordered one of hi page three time to repeat in hi ear sir remember the athenian and then again the place which i revisit and the book i read over again still smile upon me with a fresh novelty it be not without good reason say that he who have not a good memory should never take upon him the trade of lie i know very well that the grammarian distinguish betwixt an untruth and a lie and say that to tell an untruth be to tell a thing that be false but that we ourselves believe to be true and that the definition of the word to lie in latin from which our french be take be to tell a thing which we know in our conscience to be untrue and it be of this last sort of liar only that i now speak now these do either wholly contrive and invent the untruths they utter or so alter and disguise a true story that it end in a lie when they disguise and often alter the same story accord to their own fancy ti very hard for them at one time or another to escape be trap by reason that the real truth of the thing have first take possession of the memory and be there lodge impress by the medium of knowledge and science it will be difficult that it should not represent itself to the imagination and shoulder out falsehood which can not there have so sure and settled footing a the other and the circumstance of the first true knowledge evermore run in their mind will be apt to make them forget those that be illegitimate and only forge by their own fancy in what they wholly invent forasmuch a there be no contrary impression to jostle their invention there seem to be less danger of tripping and yet even this by reason it be a vain body and without any hold be very apt to escape the memory if it be not well assure of which i have very pleasant experience at the expense of such a profess only to form and accommodate their speech to the affair they have in hand or to humour of the great folk to whom they be speak for the circumstance to which these men stick not to enslave their faith and conscience be subject to several change their language must vary accordingly whence it happen that of the same thing they tell one man that it be this and another that it be that give it several colour which men if they once come to confer note and find out the cheat what become of this fine art to which may be add that they must of necessity very often ridiculously trap themselves for what memory can be sufficient to retain so many different shape a they have forge upon one and the same subject i have know many in my time very ambitious of the repute of this fine wit but they do not see that if they have the reputation of it the effect can no longer be in plain truth lying be an accursed vice we be not men nor have other tie upon one another but by our word if we do but discover the horror and gravity of it we should pursue it with fire and sword and more justly than other crime i see that parent commonly and with indiscretion enough correct their child for little innocent fault and torment them for wanton trick that have neither impression nor consequence whereas in my opinion lie only and which be of something a low form obstinacy be the fault which be to be severely whip out of them both in their infancy and in their progress otherwise they grow up and increase with them and after a tongue have once get the knack of lie ti not to be imagine how impossible it be to reclaim it whence it come to pass that we see some who be otherwise very honest men so subject and enslave to this vice i have an honest lad to my tailor whom i never know guilty of one truth no not when it have be to hi advantage if falsehood have like truth but one face only we should be upon good term for we should then take for certain the contrary to what the liar say but the reverse of truth have a hundred thousand form and a field indefinite without bound or limit the pythagorean make good to be certain and finite and evil infinite and uncertain there be a thousand way to miss the white there be only one to hit it for my own part i have this vice in so great horror that i be not sure i could prevail with my conscience to secure myself from the most manifest and extreme danger by an impudent and solemn lie an ancient father say that a dog we know be well company than a man whose language we do not understand and how much less sociable be false speak than silence king francis i vaunt that he have by this mean nonplus francesco taverna ambassador of francesco sforza duke of milan a man very famous for hi science in talk in those day this gentleman have be send to excuse hi master to hi majesty about a thing of very great consequence which be this the king still to maintain some intelligence with italy out of which he have lately be drive and particularly with the duchy of milan have think it convenient to have a gentleman on hi behalf to be with that duke an ambassador in effect but in outward appearance a private person who pretend to reside there upon hi own particular affair for the duke much more depending upon the emperor especially at a time when he be in a treaty of marriage with hi niece daughter to the king of denmark who be now dowager of lorraine could not manifest any practice and conference with u without hi great interest for this commission one merveille a milanese gentleman and an equerry to the king be think very fit be accordingly despatch thither with private credential and instruction a ambassador and with other letter of recommendation to the duke about hi own private concern the good to mask and colour the business and be so long in that court that the emperor at last have some inkling of hi real employment there which be the occasion of what follow after a we suppose which be that under pretence of some murder hi trial be in two day despatch and hi head in the night strike off in prison messire francesco be come and prepare with a long counterfeit history of the affair for the king have apply himself to all the prince of christendom as well a to the duke himself to demand satisfaction have hi audience at the morning council where after he have for the support of hi cause lay open several plausible justification of the fact that hi master have never look upon this merveille for other than a private gentleman and hi own subject who be there only in order to hi own business neither have he ever live under any other aspect absolutely disown that he have ever hear he be one of the king household or that hi majesty so much a knew him so far be he from take him for an ambassador the king in hi turn press him with several objection and demand and challenge him on all side trip him up at last by ask why then the execution be perform by night and a it be by stealth at which the poor confound ambassador the more handsomely to disengage himself make answer that the duke would have be very loth out of respect to hi majesty that such an execution should have be perform by day any one may guess if he be not well rat when he come home for have so grossly trip in the presence of a prince of so delicate a nostril a king francis pope julius ii have send an ambassador to the king of england to animate him against king francis the ambassador have have hi audience and the king before he would give an answer insist upon the difficulty he should find in set on foot so great a preparation a would be necessary to attack so potent a king and urge some reason to that effect the ambassador very unseasonably reply that he have also himself consider the same difficulty and have represent them to the pope from which say of hi so directly opposite to the thing propound and the business he come about which be immediately to incite him to war the king of england first derive the argument which he afterward find to be true that this ambassador in hi own mind be on the side of the french of which have advertise hi master hi estate at hi return home be confiscate and he himself very narrowly escape the losing of hi head so we see in the gift of eloquence wherein some have such a facility and promptness and that which we call a present wit so easy that they be ever ready upon all occasion and never to be surprise and other more heavy and slow never venture to utter anything but what they have long premeditate and take great care and pain to fit and prepare now a we teach young lady those sport and exercise which be most proper to set out the grace and beauty of those part wherein their chiefest ornament and perfection lie so it should be in these two advantage of eloquence to which the lawyer and preacher of our age seem principally to pretend if i be worthy to advise the slow speaker methinks should be more proper for the pulpit and the other for the bar and that because the employment of the first do naturally allow him all the leisure he can desire to prepare himself and besides hi career be perform in an even and unintermitted line without stop or interruption whereas the pleader business and interest compels him to enter the list upon all occasion and the unexpected objection and reply of hi adverse party jostle him out of hi course and put him upon the instant to pump for new and extempore answer and defence yet at the interview betwixt pope clement and king francis at marseille it happen quite contrary that monsieur poyet a man breed up all hi life at the bar and in the high repute for eloquence have the charge of make the harangue to the pope commit to him and have so long meditate on it beforehand a so they say to have bring it ready make along with him from paris the very day it be to have be pronounce the pope fear something might be say that might give offence to the other prince ambassador who be there attend on him send to acquaint the king with the argument which he conceive most suiting to the time and place but by chance quite another thing to that monsieur de poyet have take so much pain about so that the fine speech he have prepare be of no use and he be upon the instant to contrive another which find himself unable to do cardinal du bellay be constrain to perform that office the pleader part be doubtless much hard than that of the preacher and yet in my opinion we see more passable lawyer than preacher at all event in france it should seem that the nature of wit be to have it operation prompt and sudden and that of judgment to have it more deliberate and more slow but he who remain totally silent for want of leisure to prepare himself to speak well and he also whom leisure do noways benefit to good speak be equally unhappy ti say of severus cassius that he speak best extempore that he stand more obliged to fortune than to hi own diligence that it be an advantage to him to be interrupt in speaking and that hi adversary be afraid to nettle him l hi anger should redouble hi eloquence i know experimentally the disposition of nature so impatient of tedious and elaborate premeditation that if it do not go frankly and gaily to work it can perform nothing to purpose we say of some composition that they stink of oil and of the lamp by reason of a certain rough harshness that laborious handle imprint upon those where it have be employ but besides this the solicitude of do well and a certain striving and contending of a mind too far strained and overbent upon it undertaking break and hinders itself like water that by force of it own pressing violence and abundance can not find a ready issue through the neck of a bottle or a narrow sluice in this condition of nature of which i be now speak there be this also that it would not be disorder and stimulate with such passion a the fury of cassius for such a motion would be too violent and rude it would not be jostle but solicit it would be rouse and heat by unexpected sudden and accidental occasion if it be leave to itself it flag and languish agitation only give it grace and vigour i be always worst in my own possession and when wholly at my own disposition accident have more title to anything that come from me than i occasion company and even the very rising and fall of my own voice extract more from my fancy than i can find when i sound and employ it by myself by which mean the thing i say be good than those i write if either be to be prefer where neither be worth anything this also befall me that i do not find myself where i seek myself and i light upon thing more by chance than by any inquisition of my own judgment i perhaps sometimes hit upon something when i write that seem quaint and sprightly to me though it will appear dull and heavy to anotherbut let u leave these fine compliment every one talk thus of himself accord to hi talent but when i come to speak i be already so lost that i know not what i be about to say and in such case a stranger often find it out before me if i should make erasure so often a this inconvenience befall me i should make clean work occasion will at some other time lay it a visible to me a the light and make me wonder what i should stick at for what concern oracles it be certain that a good while before the come of jesus christ they have begin to lose their credit for we see that cicero trouble to find out the cause of their decay and he have these word but a to the other prognostic calculate from the anatomy of beast at sacrifice to which purpose plato do in part attribute the natural constitution of the intestine of the beast themselves the scraping of poultry the flight of bird clap of thunder the overflowing of river and other of the like nature upon which antiquity found most of their public and private enterprise our religion have totally abolish them and although there yet remain amongst u some practice of divination from the star from spirit from the shape and complexion of men from dream and the like a notable example of the wild curiosity of our nature to grasp at and anticipate future thing a if we have not enough to do to digest the present yet be they of much less authority now than heretofore which make so much more remarkable the example of francesco marquis of saluzzo who be lieutenant to king francis i in hi ultramontane army infinitely favour and esteem in our court and oblige to the king bounty for the marquis itself which have be forfeit by hi brother and a to the rest have no manner of provocation give him to do it and even hi own affection oppose any such disloyalty suffer himself to be so terrified a it be confidently report with the fine prognostic that be spread abroad everywhere in favour of the emperor charles v and to our disadvantage especially in italy where these foolish prophecy be so far believe that at rome great sum of money be venture out upon return of great when the prognostic come to pass so certain they make themselves of our ruin that have often bewail to those of hi acquaintance who be most intimate with him the mischief that he saw would inevitably fall upon the crown of france and the friend he have in that court he revolt and turn to the other side to hi own misfortune nevertheless what constellation soever govern at that time but he carry himself in this affair like a man agitate by diver passion for have both town and force in hi hand the enemys army under antonio de leyva close by him and we not at all suspect hi design it have be in hi power to have do more than he do for we lose no men by this infidelity of hi nor any town but fossano only and that after a long siege and a brave defence and those who take this sentence in a contrary sense interpret it amiss much more wisely pacuvius the so celebrated art of divination amongst the tuscan take it beginning thus a labourer strike deep with hi cutter into the earth saw the demigod tages ascend with an infantine aspect but endue with a mature and senile wisdom upon the rumour of which all the people run to see the sight by whom hi word and science contain the principle and mean to attain to this art be record and keep for many age a birth suitable to it progress i for my part should sooner regulate my affair by the chance of a die than by such idle and vain dream and indeed in all republic a good share of the government have ever be refer to chance plato in the civil regimen that he model accord to hi own fancy leave to it the decision of several thing of very great importance and will amongst other thing that marriage should be appoint by lot attribute so great importance to this accidental choice a to ordain that the child beget in such wedlock be bring up in the country and those begotten in any other be thrust out a spurious and base yet so that if any of those exile notwithstanding should peradventure in grow up give any good hope of himself he might be recall a also that such a have be retain should be exile in case they give little expectation of themselves in their early growth i see some who be mightily give to study and comment upon their almanac and produce them to u a an authority when anything have fall out pat and for that matter it be hardly possible but that these allege authority sometimes stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lie i think never the good of them for some such accidental hit there would be more certainty in it if there be a rule and a truth of always lie besides nobody record their flimflam and false prognostic forasmuch a they be infinite and common but if they chop upon one truth that carry a mighty report a be rare incredible and prodigious so diogenes surnamed the atheist answer him in samothrace who show him in the temple the several offering and story in painting of those who have escape shipwreck say to him look you who think the god have no care of human thing what do you say to so many person preserve from death by their especial favour why i say answer he that their picture be not here who be cast away who be by much the great number cicero observe that of all the philosopher who have acknowledge a deity xenophanes the colophonian only have endeavour to eradicate all manner of divination which make it the less a wonder if we have now and then see some of our prince sometimes to their own cost rely too much upon these vanity i have give anything with my own eye to see those two great marvel the book of joachim the calabrian abbot which foretell all the future pope their name and quality and that of the emperor leo which prophesy all the emperor and patriarch of greece this i have be an eyewitness of that in public confusion men astonish at their fortune have abandon their own reason superstitiously to seek out in the star the ancient cause and menace of the present mishap and in my time have be so strangely successful in it a to make me believe that this be an amusement of sharp and volatile wit those who have be verse in this knack of unfold and untying riddle be capable in any sort of write to find out what they desire but above all that which give them the great room to play in be the obscure ambiguous and fantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting where their author deliver nothing of clear sense but shroud all in riddle to the end that posterity may interpret and apply it accord to it own fancy socrates demon might perhaps be no other but a certain impulsion of the will which obtrude itself upon him without the advice or consent of hi judgment and in a soul so enlighten a hi be and so prepared by a continual exercise of wisdomand virtue ti to be suppose those inclination of hi though sudden and undigested be very important and worthy to be follow every one find in himself some image of such agitation of a prompt vehement and fortuitous opinion and i may well allow them some authority who attribute so little to our prudence and who also myself have have some weak in reason but violent in persuasion and dissuasion which be most frequent with socrates by which i have suffer myself to be carry away so fortunately and so much to my own advantage that they might have be judge to have have something in them of a divine inspiration the law of resolution and constancy do not imply that we ought not as much a in u lie to decline and secure ourselves from the mischief and inconvenience that threaten u nor consequently that we shall not fear l they should surprise u on the contrary all decent and honest way and mean of secure ourselves from harm be not only permit but moreover commendable and the business of constancy chiefly be bravely to stand to and stoutly to suffer those inconvenience which be not possibly to be avoid so that there be no supple motion of body nor any movement in the handling of arm how irregular or ungraceful soever that we need condemn if they serve to protect u from the blow that be make against u several very warlike nation have make use of a retreating and fly way of fight a a thing of singular advantage and by so do have make their back more dangerous to their enemy than their face of which kind of fight the turk still retain something in their practice of arm and socrates in plato laugh at laches who have define fortitude to be a standing firm in the rank against the enemy what say he would it then be a reputed cowardice to overcome them by give ground urge at the same time the authority of homer who commend in aeneas the science of flight and whereas laches consider good of it admit the practice a to the scythian and in general all cavalry whatever he again attack him with the example of the lacedaemonian foota nation of all other the most obstinate in maintain their groundwho in the battle of plataea not be able to break into the persian phalanx bethink themselves to disperse and retire that by the enemy suppose they flee they might break and disunite that vast body of men in the pursuit and by that stratagem obtain the victory a for the scythian ti say of them that when darius go hi expedition to subdue them he send by a herald highly to reproach their king that he always retire before him and decline a battle to which idanthyrses for that be hi name return answer that it be not for fear of him or of any man living that he do so but that it be the way of marching in practice with hi nation who have neither tilled field city nor house to defend or to fear the enemy should make any advantage of but that if he have such a stomach to fight let him but come to view their ancient place of sepulture and there he should have hi fill nevertheless a to cannonshot when a body of men be draw up in the face of a train of artillery a the occasion of war often require it be unhandsome to quit their post to avoid the danger forasmuch a by reason of it violence and swiftness we account it inevitable and many a one by duck step aside and such other motion of fear have be at all event sufficiently laugh at by hi companion and yet in the expedition that the emperor charles v make against u into provence the marquis de guast go to reconnoitre the city of arles and advance out of the cover of a windmill under favour of which he have make hi approach be perceive by the seigneur de bonneval and the seneschal of agenois who be walk upon the theatre aux ayenes who have show him to the sieur de villiers commissary of the artillery he point a culverin so admirably well and level it so exactly right against him that have not the marquis seeing fire give to it slip aside it be certainly conclude the shot have take him full in the body and in like manner some year before lorenzo de medici duke of urbino and father to the queenmother lay siege to mondolfo a place in the territory of the vicariat in italy see the cannoneer give fire to a piece that point directly against him it be well for him that he duck for otherwise the shot that only raze the top of hi head have doubtless hit him full in the breast to say truth i do not think that these evasion be perform upon the account of judgment for how can any man live judge of high or low aim on so sudden an occasion and it be much more easy to believe that fortune favour their apprehension and that it might be as well at another time to make them face the danger a to seek to avoid it for my own part i confess i can not forbear start when the rattle of a harquebus thunder in my ear on a sudden and in a place where i be not to expect it which i have also observe in other braver fellows than i neither do the stoic pretend that the soul of their philosopher need be proof against the first vision and fantasy that surprise him but a to a natural subjection consent that he should tremble at the terrible noise of thunder or the sudden clatter of some fall ruin and be affright even to paleness and convulsion and so in other passion provide hi judgment remain sound and entire and that the seat of hi reason suffer no concussion nor alteration and that he yield no consent to hi fright and discomposure to him who be not a philosopher a fright be the same thing in the first part of it but quite another thing in the second for the impression of passion do not remain superficially in him but penetrate far even to the very seat of reason infecting and corrupt it so that he judge accord to hi fear and conform hi behaviour to it in this verse you may see the true state of the wise stoic learnedly and plainly express the peripatetic sage do not exempt himself totally from perturbation of mind but he moderate them there be no subject so frivolous that do not merit a place in this rhapsody accord to our common rule of civility it would be a notable affront to an equal and much more to a superior to fail be at home when he have give you notice he will come to visit you nay queen margaret of navarre further add that it would be a rudeness in a gentleman to go out a we so often do to meet any that be come to see him let him be of what high condition soever and that it be more respectful and more civil to stay at home to receive him if only upon the account of miss him by the way and that it be enough to receive him at the door and to wait upon him for my part who as much a i can endeavour to reduce the ceremony of my house i very often forget both the one and the other of these vain office if peradventure some one may take offence at this i cant help it it be much good to offend him once than myself every day for it would be a perpetual slavery to what end do we avoid the servile attendance of court if we bring the same trouble home to our own private house it be also a common rule in all assembly that those of less quality be to be first upon the place by reason that it be more due to the good sort to make other wait and expect them nevertheless at the interview betwixt pope clement and king francis at marseille the king after he have take order for the necessary preparation for hi reception and entertainment withdraw out of the town and give the pope two or three day respite for hi entry and to repose and refresh himself before he come to him and in like manner at the assignation of the pope and the emperor at bologna the emperor give the pope opportunity to come thither first and come himself after for which the reason give be this that at all the interview of such prince the great ought to be first at the appointed place especially before the other in whose territory the interview be appoint to be intimate thereby a kind of deference to the other it appear proper for the less to seek out and to apply themselves to the great and not the great to them not every country only but every city and every society have it particular form of civility there be care enough to this take in my education and i have live in good company enough to know the formality of our own nation and be able to give lesson in it i love to follow them but not to be so servilely tie to their observation that my whole life should be enslave to ceremony of which there be some so troublesome that provide a man omit them out of discretion and not for want of breed it will be every whit a handsome i have see some people rude by be overcivil and troublesome in their courtesy still these excess except the knowledge of courtesy and good manner be a very necessary study it be like grace and beauty that which beget like and an inclination to love one another at the first sight and in the very beginning of acquaintance and consequently that which first open the door and intromit u to instruct ourselves by the example of other and to give example ourselves if we have any worth take notice of and communicate valour have it bound as well a other virtue which once transgress the next step be into the territory of vice so that by have too large a proportion of this heroic virtue unless a man be very perfect in it limit which upon the confines be very hard to discern he may very easily unawares run into temerity obstinacy and folly from this consideration it be that we have derive the custom in time of war to punish even with death those who be obstinate to defend a place that by the rule of war be not tenable otherwise men would be so confident upon the hope of impunity that not a henroost but would resist and seek to stop an army the constable monsieur de montmorenci have at the siege of pavia be order to pass the ticino and to take up hi quarter in the faubourg st antonio be hinder by a tower at the end of the bridge which be so obstinate a to endure a battery hang every man he find within it for their labour and again accompany the dauphin in hi expedition beyond the alp and take the castle of villano by assault and all within it be put to the sword by the fury of the soldier the governor and hi ensign only except he cause them both to be truss up for the same reason a also do the captain martin du bellay then governor of turin with the governor of san buono in the same country all hi people have be cut to piece at the taking of the place but forasmuch a the strength or weakness of a fortress be always measure by the estimate and counterpoise of the force that attack it for a man might reasonably enough despise two culverin that would be a madman to abide a battery of thirty piece of cannonwhere also the greatness of the prince who be master of the field hi reputation and the respect that be due unto him be also put into the balance there be danger that the balance be press too much in that direction and it may happen that a man be possess with so great an opinion of himself and hi power that think it unreasonable any place should dare to shut it gate against him he put all to the sword where he meet with any opposition whilst hi fortune continue a be plain in the fierce and arrogant form of summon town and denounce war savour so much of barbarian pride and insolence in use amongst the oriental prince and which their successor to this day do yet retain and practise and in that part of the world where the portuguese subdue the indian they find some state where it be a universal and inviolable law amongst them that every enemy overcome by the king in person or by hi lieutenant be out of composition so above all both of ransom and mercy a man should take heed if he can of fall into the hand of a judge who be an enemy and victorious i once heard of a prince and a great captain have a narration give him a he sit at table of the proceeding against monsieur de vervins who be sentence to death for have surrender boulogne to the english openly maintain that a soldier could not justly be put to death for want of courage and in truth ti reason that a man should make a great difference betwixt fault that merely proceed from infirmity and those that be visibly the effect of treachery and malice for in the last we act against the rule of reason that nature have imprint in u whereas in the former it seem a if we might produce the same nature who leave u in such a state of imperfection and weakness of courage for our justification insomuch that many have think we be not fairly questionable for anything but what we commit against our conscience and it be partly upon this rule that those ground their opinion who disapprove of capital or sanguinary punishment inflict upon heretic and misbeliever and theirs also who advocate or a judge be not accountable for have from mere ignorance fail in hi administration but a to cowardice it be certain that the most usual way of chastise it be by ignominy and and it be suppose that this practice bring into use by the legislator charondas and that before hi time the law of greece punish those with death who flee from a battle whereas he ordain only that they be for three day expose in the public dress in woman attire hop yet for some service from them have awaken their courage by this open shame it appear also that the roman law do anciently punish those with death who have run away for ammianus marcellinus say that the emperor julian command ten of hi soldier who have turn their back in an encounter against the parthian to be first degrade and afterward put to death accord say he to the ancient law and yet elsewhere for the like offence he only condemn other to remain amongst the prisoner under the baggage ensign the severe punishment the people of rome inflict upon those who flee from the battle of cannae and those who run away with aeneius fulvius at hi defeat do not extend to death and yet methinks ti to be fear l disgrace should make such delinquent desperate and not only faint friend but enemy of late memory the seigneur de frauget lieutenant to the mareschal de chatillons company have by the mareschal de chabannes be put in government of fuentarabia in the place of monsieur de lude and have surrender it to the spaniard he be for that condemn to be degrade from all nobility and both himself and hi posterity declare ignoble taxable and for ever incapable of bear arm which severe sentence be afterwards accordingly execute at lyon and since that all the gentleman who be in guise when the count of nassau enter into it undergo the same punishment a several other have do since for the like offence notwithstanding in case of such a manifest ignorance or cowardice a exceeds all ordinary example ti but reason to take it for a sufficient proof of treachery and malice and for such to be punish i observe in my travel this custom ever to learn something from the information of those with whom i confer which be the best school of all other and to put my company upon those subject they be the best able to speak of for it often fall out that on the contrary every one will rather choose to be prate of another man province than hi own thinking it so much new reputation acquire witness the jeer archidamus put upon pertander that he have quit the glory of be an excellent physician to gain the repute of a very bad poet and do but observe how large and ample caesar be to make u understand hi invention of building bridge and contrive engine of war and how succinct and reserve in comparison where he speak of the office of hi profession hi own valour and military conduct hi exploit sufficiently prove him a great captain and that he know well enough but he would be think an excellent engineer to boot a quality something different and not necessary to be expect in him the elder dionysius be a very great captain a it befit hi fortune he should be but he take very great pain to get a particular reputation by poetry and yet he be never cut out for a poet a man of the legal profession be not long since bring to see a study furnish with all sort of book both of hi own and all other faculty take no occasion at all to entertain himself with any of them but fell very rudely and magisterially to descant upon a barricade place on the wind stair before the study door a thing that a hundred captain and common soldier see every day without take any notice or offence by this course a man shall never improve himself nor arrive at any perfection in anything he must therefore make it hi business always to put the architect the painter the statuary every mechanic artisan upon discourse of their own capacity and to this purpose in read history which be everybodys subject i use to consider what kind of men be the author if they be person that profess nothing but mere letter i in and from them principally observe and learn style and language if physician i the rather incline to credit what they report of the temperature of the air of the health and complexion of prince of wound and disease if lawyer we be from them to take notice of the controversy of right and wrong the establishment of law and civil government and the like if divine the affair of the church ecclesiastical censure marriage and dispensation if courtier manner and ceremony if soldier the thing that properly belong to their trade and principally the account of the action and enterprise wherein they be personally engage if ambassador we be to observe negotiation intelligence and practice and the manner how they be to be carry on and this be the reason why which perhaps i should have lightly pass over in another i dwell upon and maturely consider one passage in the history write by monsieur de langey a man of very great judgment in thing of that nature after have give a narrative of the fine oration charles v have make in the consistory at rome and in the presence of the bishop of macon and monsieur du velly our ambassador there wherein he have mixed several injurious expression to the dishonour of our nation and amongst the rest that if hi captain and soldier be not men of another kind of fidelity resolution and sufficiency in the knowledge of arm than those of the king he would immediately go with a rope about hi neck and sue to him for mercy and it should seem the emperor have really this or a very little good opinion of our military men for he afterwards twice or thrice in hi life say the very same thing a also that he challenge the king to fight him in hi shirt with rapier and poignard in a boat the say sieur de langey pursue hi history add that the forenamed ambassador send a despatch to the king of these thing conceal the great part and particularly the last two passage at which i could not but wonder that it should be in the power of an ambassador to dispense with anything which he ought to signify to hi master especially of so great importance a this come from the mouth of such a person and spoken in so great an assembly and i should rather conceive it have be the servant duty faithfully to have represent to him the whole thing a it pass to the end that the liberty of select dispose judging and concluding might have remain in him for either to conceal or to disguise the truth for fear he should take it otherwise than he ought to do and lest it should prompt him to some extravagant resolution and in the meantime to leave him ignorant of hi affair should seem methinks rather to belong to him who be to give the law than to him who be only to receive it to him who be in supreme command and not to him who ought to look upon himself a inferior not only in authority but also in prudence and good counsel i for my part would not be so serve in my little concern we so willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever and be so ready to usurp upon dominion every one do so naturally aspire to liberty and power that no utility whatever derive from the wit or valour of those he employ ought to be so dear to a superior a a downright and sincere obedience to obey more upon the account of understand than of subjection be to corrupt the office of command insomuch that p crassus the same whom the roman repute five time happy at the time when he be consul in asia have send to a greek engineer to cause the great of two mast of ship that he have take notice of at athens to be bring to him to be employ about some engine of battery he have a design to make the other presume upon hi own science and sufficiency in those affair think fit to do otherwise than direct and to bring the le which accord to the rule of art be really more proper for the use to which it be design but crassus though he give ear to hi reason with great patience would not however take them how sound or convincing soever for current pay but cause him to be well whip for hi pain value the interest of discipline much more than that of the work in hand notwithstanding we may on the other side consider that so precise and implicit an obedience a this be only due to positive and limited command the employment of ambassador be never so confined many thing in their management of affair be wholly refer to the absolute sovereignty of their own conduct they do not simply execute but also to their own discretion and wisdom form and model their master pleasure i have in my time know men of command check for have rather obey the express word of the king letter than the necessity of the affair they have in hand men of understand do yet to this day condemn the custom of the king of persia to give their lieutenant and agent so little rein that upon the least arising difficulty they must fain have recourse to their further command this delay in so vast an extent of dominion have often very much prejudice their affair and crassus write to a man whose profession it be best to understand those thing and preacquainting him to what use this mast be design do he not seem to consult hi advice and in a manner invite him to interpose hi good judgment i be not so good a naturalist a they call it a to discern by what secret spring fear have it motion in u but be this a it may tis a strange passion and such a one that the physician say there be no other whatever that sooner dethrone our judgment from it proper seat which be so true that i myself have see very many become frantic through fear and even in those of the best settled temper it be most certain that it beget a terrible astonishment and confusion during the fit i omit the vulgar sort to whom it one while represent their greatgrandsires rise out of their graf in their shroud another while werewolves nightmare and chimaera but even amongst soldier a sort of men over whom of all other it ought to have the least power how often have it convert flock of sheep into armed squadron reed and bullrush into pike and lance friend into enemy and the french white cross into the red cross of spain when monsieur de bourbon take romein 1527an ensign who be upon guard at borgo san pietro be seize with such a fright upon the first alarm that he throw himself out at a breach with hi colour upon hi shoulder and run directly upon the enemy thinking he have retreat toward the inward defence of the city and with much ado see monsieur de bourbon people who think it have be a sally upon them draw up to receive him at last come to himself and saw hi error and then face about he retreat full speed through the same breach by which he have go out but not till he have first blindly advance above three hundred pace into the open field it do not however fall out so well with captain giulios ensign at the time when st paul be take from u by the comte de bures and monsieur de reu for he be so astonish with fear a to throw himself colour and all out of a porthole be immediately cut to piece by the enemy and in the same siege it be a very memorable fear that so seize contract and freeze up the heart of a gentleman that he sink down stonedead in the breach without any manner of wound or hurt at all the like madness do sometimes push on a whole multitude for in one of the encounter that germanicus have with the german two great party be so amaze with fear that they run two opposite way the one to the same place from which the other have flee sometimes it add wing to the heel a in the two first sometimes it nail them to the ground and fetter them from move a we read of the emperor theophilus who in a battle he lose against the agarenes be so astonished and stupefy that he have no power to fly till such time a manuel one of the principal commander of hi army have jog and shake him so a to rouse him out of hi trance say to him sir if you will not follow me i will kill you for it be well you should lose your life than by be take lose your empire but fear do then manifest it utmost power when it throw u upon a valiant despair have before deprived u of all sense both of duty and honour in the first pitched battle the roman lose against hannibal under the consul sempronius a body of ten thousand foot that have take fright see no other escape for their cowardice go and throw themselves headlong upon the great battalion of the enemy which with marvellous force and fury they charge through and through and rout with a very great slaughter of the carthaginian thus purchase an ignominious flight at the same price they might have gain a glorious victory the thing in the world i be most afraid of be fear that passion alone in the trouble of it exceed all other accident what affliction could be great or more just than that of pompey friend who in hi ship be spectator of that horrible murder yet so it be that the fear of the egyptian vessel they saw come to board them possess them with so great alarm that it be observe they think of nothing but call upon the mariner to make haste and by force of oar to escape away till be arrive at tyre and deliver from fear they have leisure to turn their thought to the loss of their captain and to give vent to those tear and lamentation that the other more potent passion have till then suspend such a have be well rub in some skirmish may yet all wound and bloody a they be be bring on again the next day to charge but such a have once conceive a good sound fear of the enemy will never be make so much a to look him in the face such a be in immediate fear of a lose their estate of banishment or of slavery live in perpetual anguish and lose all appetite and repose whereas such a be actually poor slave or exile ofttimes live as merrily a other folk and the many people who impatient of the perpetual alarm of fear have hang or drown themselves or dash themselves to piece give u sufficiently to understand that fear be more importunate and insupportable than death itself the greek acknowledge another kind of fear differ from any we have speak of yet that surprise u without any visible cause by an impulse from heaven so that whole nation and whole army have be strike with it such a one be that which bring so wonderful a desolation upon carthage where nothing be to be hear but affrighted voice and outcry where the inhabitant be see to sally out of their house a to an alarm and there to charge wound and kill one another a if they have be enemy come to surprise their city all thing be in disorder and fury till with prayer and sacrifice they have appease their god and this be that they call panic terror the very child know the story of king croesus to this purpose who be take prisoner by cyrus and by him condemn to die a he be go to execution cry out o solon solon which be presently report to cyrus and he send to inquire of him what it mean croesus give him to understand that he now find the teaching solon have formerly give him true to hi cost which be that men however fortune may smile upon them could never be say to be happy till they have be see to pass over the last day of their life by reason of the uncertainty and mutability of human thing which upon very light and trivial occasion be subject to be totally change into a quite contrary condition and so it be that agesilaus make answer to one who be say what a happy young man the king of persia be to come so young to so mighty a kingdom ti true say he but neither be priam unhappy at hi year in a short time king of macedon successor to that mighty alexander become joiner and scrivener at rome a tyrant of sicily a pedant at corinth a conqueror of onehalf of the world and general of so many army a miserable suppliant to the rascally officer of a king of egypt so much do the prolongation of five or six month of life cost the great pompey and in our father day ludovico sforza the tenth duke of milan whom all italy have so long truckled under be see to die a wretched prisoner at loch but not till he have live ten year in captivity which be the bad part of hi fortune the fair of all queen widow to the great king in europe do she not come to die by the hand of an executioner unworthy and barbarous cruelty and a thousand more example there be of the same kind for it seem that a storm and tempest have a malice against the proud and overtowering height of our lofty building there be also spirit above that be envious of the greatness here below and it should seem also that fortune sometimes lie in wait to surprise the last hour of our life to show the power she have in a moment to overthrow what she be so many year in building make u cry out with laberius and in this sense this good advice of solon may reasonably be take but he be a philosopher with which sort of men the favour and disgrace of fortune stand for nothing either to the make a man happy or unhappy and with whom grandeur and power be accident of a quality almost indifferent i be apt to think that he have some further aim and that hi meaning be that the very felicity of life itself which depend upon the tranquillity and contentment of a welldescended spirit and the resolution and assurance of a wellordered soul ought never to be attribute to any man till he have first be see to play the last and doubtless the hard act of hi part there may be disguise and dissimulation in all the rest where these fine philosophical discourse be only put on and where accident not touch u to the quick give u leisure to maintain the same gravity of aspect but in this last scene of death there be no more counterfeiting we must speak out plain and discover what there be of good and clean in the bottom of the pot wherefore at this last all the other action of our life ought to be try and sift ti the masterday tis the day that be judge of all the rest ti the day say one of the ancient that must be judge of all my foregoing year to death do i refer the assay of the fruit of all my study we shall then see whether my discourse come only from my mouth or from my heart i have see many by their death give a good or an ill repute to their whole life scipio the fatherinlaw of pompey in die well remove the ill opinion that till then every one have conceive of him epaminondas be ask which of the three he have in great esteem chabrias iphicrates or himself you must first see u die say he before that question can be resolve and in truth he would infinitely wrong that man who would weigh him without the honour and grandeur of hi end god have order all thing a it have best please him but i have in my time see three of the most execrable person that ever i know in all manner of abominable living and the most infamous to boot who all die a very regular death and in all circumstance compose even to perfection there be brave and fortunate death i have see death cut the thread of the progress of a prodigious advancement and in the height and flower of it increase of a certain person with so glorious an end that in my opinion hi ambitious and generous design have nothing in them so high and great a their interruption he arrive without complete hi course at the place to which hi ambition aim with great glory than he could either have hop or desire anticipating by hi fall the name and power to which he aspire in perfect hi career in the judgment i make of another man life i always observe how he carry himself at hi death and the principal concern i have for my own be that i may die wellthat be patiently and tranquilly cicero say that to study philosophy be nothing but to prepare one self to die the reason of which be because study and contemplation do in some sort withdraw from u our soul and employ it separately from the body which be a kind of apprenticeshipand a resemblance of death or els because all the wisdom and reasoning in the world do in the end conclude in this point to teach u not to fear to die and to say the truth either our reason mock u or it ought to have no other aim but our contentment only nor to endeavour anything but in sum to make u live well and a the holy scripture say at our ease all the opinion of the world agree in this that pleasure be our end though we make use of diver mean to attain it they would otherwise be reject at the first motion for who would give ear to him that should propose affliction and misery for hi end the controversy and dispute of the philosophical sect upon this point be merely verbal there be more in them of opposition and obstinacy than be consistent with so sacred a profession but whatsoever personage a man take upon himself to perform he ever mix hi own part with it let the philosopher say what they will the thing at which we all aim even in virtue be pleasure it amuse me to rattle in ear this word which they so nauseate to and if it signify some supreme pleasure and contentment it be more due to the assistance of virtue than to any other assistance whatever this pleasure for be more gay more sinewy more robust and more manly be only the more seriously voluptuous and we ought give it the name of pleasure a that which be more favourable gentle and natural and not that from which we have denominate it the other and mean pleasure if it could deserve this fair name it ought to be by way of competition and not of privilege i find it less exempt from traverse and inconvenience than virtue itself and besides that the enjoyment be more momentary fluid and frail it have it watching fast and labour it sweat and it blood and moreover have particular to itself so many several sort of sharp and wounding passion and so dull a satiety attend it a equal it to the severe penance and we mistake if we think that these incommodities serve it for a spur and a seasoning to it sweetness a in nature one contrary be quicken by another or say when we come to virtue that like consequence and difficulty overwhelm and render it austere and inaccessible whereas much more aptly than in voluptuousness they ennoble sharpen and heighten the perfect and divine pleasure they procure u he render himself unworthy of it who will counterpoise it cost with it fruit and neither understand the bless nor how to use it those who preach to u that the quest of it be craggy difficult and painful but it fruition pleasant what do they mean by that but to tell u that it be always unpleasing for what human mean will ever attain it enjoyment the most perfect have be fain to content themselves to aspire unto it and to approach it only without ever possess it but they be deceive see that of all the pleasure we know the very pursuit be pleasant the attempt ever relish of the quality of the thing to which it be direct for it be a good part of and consubstantial with the effect the felicity and beatitude that glitter in virtue shine throughout all her appurtenance and avenue even to the first entry and utmost limit now of all the benefit that virtue confers upon u the contempt of death be one of the great a the mean that accommodate human life with a soft and easy tranquillity and give u a pure and pleasant taste of living without which all other pleasure would be extinct which be the reason why all the rule centre and concur in this one article and although they all in like manner with common accord teach u also to despise pain poverty and the other accident to which human life be subject it be not nevertheless with the same solicitude a well by reason these accident be not of so great necessity the great part of mankind passing over their whole life without ever know what poverty be and some without sorrow or sickness a xenophilus the musician who live a hundred and six year in a perfect and continual health a also because at the bad death can whenever we please cut short and put an end to all other inconvenience but a to death it be inevitable and consequently if it fright u tis a perpetual torment for which there be no sort of consolation there be no way by which it may not reach u we may continually turn our head this way and that as in a suspected country our court of justice often send back condemn criminal to be execute upon the place where the crime be commit but carry them to fine house by the way prepare for them the best entertainment you can do you think they can relish it and that the fatal end of their journey be continually before their eye would not alter and deprave their palate from taste these regalios the end of our race be death ti the necessary object of our aim which if it fright u how be it possible to advance a step without a fit of ague the remedy the vulgar use be not to think ont but from what brutish stupidity can they derive so gross a blindness they must bridle the as by the tail ti no wonder if he be often trap in the pitfall they affright people with the very mention of death and many cross themselves a it be the name of the devil and because the make a man will be in reference to die not a man will be persuade to take a pen in hand to that purpose till the physician have pass sentence upon and totally give him over and then betwixt and terror god know in how fit a condition of understand he be to do it the roman by reason that this poor syllable death sound so harshly to their ear and seem so ominous find out a way to soften and spin it out by a periphrasis and instead of pronounce such a one be dead say such a one have live or such a one have cease to live for provided there be any mention of life in the case though past it carry yet some sound of consolation and from them it be that we have borrow our expression the late monsieur such and such a one peradventure a the saying be the term we have live be worth our money i be bear betwixt eleven and twelve oclock in the forenoon the last day of february 1533 accord to our computation begin the year the 1st of january and it be now but just fifteen day since i be complete nineandthirty year old i make account to live at least a many more in the meantime to trouble a man self with the thought of a thing so far off be folly but what young and old die upon the same term no one depart out of life otherwise than if he have but just before enter into it neither be any man so old and decrepit who have heard of methuselah do not think he have yet twenty good year to come fool that thou art who have assure unto thee the term of life thou dependest upon physician tale rather consult effect and experience accord to the common course of thing ti long since that thou hast live by extraordinary favour thou hast already outlive the ordinary term of life and that it be so reckon up thy acquaintance how many more have die before they arrive at thy age than have attain unto it and of those who have ennoble their life by their renown take but an account and i dare lay a wager thou wilt find more who have die before than after fiveandthirty year of age it be full both of reason and piety too to take example by the humanity of jesus christ himself now he end hi life at threeandthirty year the great man that be no more than a man alexander die also at the same age how many several way have death to surprise u to omit fever and pleurisy who would ever have imagine that a duke of brittany should be press to death in a crowd a that duke be at the entry of pope clement my neighbour into lyon hast thou not see one of our king kill at a tilting and do not one of hi ancestor die by jostle of a hog aeschylus threaten with the fall of a house be to much purpose circumspect to avoid that danger see that he be knock on the head by a tortoise fall out of an eagles talon in the air another be choke with a grapestone an emperor kill with the scratch of a comb in comb hi head aemilius lepidus with a stumble at hi own threshold and aufidius with a jostle against the door a he enter the councilchamber and betwixt the very thigh of woman cornelius gallus the proctor tigillinus captain of the watch at rome ludovico son of guido di gonzaga marquis of mantua and of bad example speusippus a platonic philosopher and one of our pope the poor judge bebius give adjournment in a case for eight day but he himself meanwhile be condemn by death and hi own stay of life expire whilst caius julius the physician be anoint the eye of a patient death close hi own and if i may bring in an example of my own blood a brother of mine captain st martin a young man threeandtwenty year old who have already give sufficient testimony of hi valour play a match at tennis receive a blow of a ball a little above hi right ear which a it give no manner of sign of wound or contusion he take no notice of it nor so much a sat down to repose himself but nevertheless die within five or six hour after of an apoplexy occasion by that blow these so frequent and common example pass every day before our eye how be it possible a man should disengage himself from the thought of death or avoid fancying that it have u every moment by the throat what matter be it you will say which way it come to pass provide a man do not terrify himself with the expectation for my part i be of this mind and if a man could by any mean avoid it though by creep under a calf skin i be one that should not be ashamed of the shift all i aim at be to pass my time at my ease and the recreation that will most contribute to it i take hold of as little glorious and exemplary a you will but tis folly to think of do anything that way they go they come they gallop and dance and not a word of death all this be very fine but withal when it come either to themselves their wife their child or friend surprise them at unawares and unprepared then what torment what outcry what madness and despair did you ever see anything so subdue so change and so confound a man must therefore make more early provision for it and this brutish negligence could it possibly lodge in the brain of any man of sense which i think utterly impossible sell u it merchandise too dear were it an enemy that could be avoid i would then advise to borrow arm even of cowardice itself but see it be not and that it will catch you as well fly and play the poltroon a stand tot like an honest man and see that no temper of arm be of proof to secure u let u learn bravely to stand our ground and fight him and to begin to deprive him of the great advantage he have over u let u take a way quite contrary to the common course let u disarm him of hi novelty and strangeness let u converse and be familiar with him and have nothing so frequent in our thought a death upon all occasion represent him to our imagination in hi every shape at the stumbling of a horse at the fall of a tile at the least prick with a pin let u presently consider and say to ourselves well and what if it have be death itself and thereupon let u encourage and fortify ourselves let u evermore amidst our jollity and feasting set the remembrance of our frail condition before our eye never suffer ourselves to be so far transport with our delight but that we have some interval of reflect upon and consider how many several way this jollity of ours tends to death and with how many danger it threaten it the egyptian be wont to do after this manner who in the height of their feasting and mirth cause a dried skeleton of a man to be bring into the room to serve for a memento to their guest where death wait for u be uncertain let u look for him everywhere the premeditation of death be the premeditation of liberty he who have learn to die have unlearn to serve there be nothing evil in life for him who rightly comprehend that the privation of life be no evil to know how to die delivers u from all subjection and constraint paulus emilius answer him whom the miserable king of macedon hi prisoner send to entreat him that he would not lead him in hi triumph let him make that request to himself in truth in all thing if nature do not help a little it be very hard for art and industry to perform anything to purpose i be in my own nature not melancholic but meditative and there be nothing i have more continually entertain myself withal than imagination of death even in the most wanton time of my age in the company of lady and at game some have perhaps think me possess with some jealousy or the uncertainty of some hope whilst i be entertain myself with the remembrance of some one surprise a few day before with a burn fever of which he die return from an entertainment like this with hi head full of idle fancy of love and jollity a mine be then and that for aught i know the samedestiny be attend me yet do not this thought wrinkle my forehead any more than any other it be impossible but we must feel a sting in such imagination a these at first but with often turn and return them in one mind they at last become so familiar a to be no trouble at all otherwise i for my part should be in a perpetual fright and frenzy for never man be so distrustful of hi life never man so uncertain a to it duration neither health which i have hitherto ever enjoy very strong and vigorous and very seldom interrupt do prolong nor sickness contract my hope every minute methinks i be escape and it eternally run in my mind that what may be do tomorrow may be do today hazard and danger do in truth little or nothing hasten our end and if we consider how many thousand more remain and hang over our head besides the accident that immediately threaten u we shall find that the sound and the sick those that be abroad at sea and those that sit by the fire those who be engage in battle and those who sit idle at home be the one a near it a the other for anything i have to do before i die the long leisure would appear too short be it but an hour business i have to do a friend of mine the other day turn over my tablet find therein a memorandum of something i would have do after my decease whereupon i tell him a it be really true that though i be no more than a leagues distance only from my own house and merry and well yet when that thing come into my head i make haste to write it down there because i be not certain to live till i come home a a man that be eternally brood over my own thought and confine them to my own particular concern i be at all hour a well prepared a i be ever like to be and death whenever he shall come can bring nothing along with him i do not expect long before we should always as near a we can be boot and spur and ready to go and above all thing take care at that time to have no business with any one but one self for we shall there find work enough to do without any need of addition one man complain more than of death that he be thereby prevent of a glorious victory another that he must die before he have marry hi daughter or educate hi child a third seem only troubled that he must lose the society of hi wife a fourth the conversation of hi son a the principal comfort and concern of hi be for my part i be thanks be to god at this instant in such a condition that i be ready to dislodge whenever it shall please him without regret for anything whatsoever i disengage myself throughout from all worldly relation my leave be soon take of all but myself never do any one prepare to bid adieu to the world more absolutely and unreservedly and to shake hand with all manner of interest in it than i expect to do the dead death be the best and the builder a man must design nothing that will require so much time to the finishing or at least with no such passionate desire to see it bring to perfection we be bear to action i would always have a man to be do and as much a in him lie to extend and spin out the office of life and then let death take me plant my cabbage indifferent to him and still less of my garden not be finish i saw one die who at hi last gasp complain of nothing so much a that destiny be about to cut the thread of a chronicle he be then compile when he be go no far than the fifteenth or sixteenth of our king we be to discharge ourselves from these vulgar and hurtful humour to this purpose it be that men first appoint the place of sepulture adjoin the church and in the most frequented place of the city to accustom say lycurgus the common people woman and child that they should not be startle at the sight of a corpse and to the end that the continual spectacle of bone graf and funeral obsequies should put u in mind of our frail condition and a the egyptian after their feast be wont to present the company with a great image of death by one that cry out to them drink and be merry for such shalt thou be when thou art dead so it be my custom to have death not only in my imagination but continually in my mouth neither be there anything of which i be so inquisitive and delight to inform myself a the manner of men death their word look and bear nor any place in history i be so intent upon and it be manifest enough by my crowding in example of this kind that i have a particular fancy for that subject if i be a writer of book i would compile a register with a comment of the various death of men he who should teach men to die would at the same time teach them to live dicarchus make one to which he give that title but it be design for another and less profitable end peradventure some one may object that the pain and terror of die so infinitely exceed all manner of imagination that the best fencer will be quite out of hi play when it come to the push let them say what they will to premeditate be doubtless a very great advantage and besides be it nothing to go so far at least without disturbance or alteration moreover nature herself assist and encourage u if the death be sudden and violent we have not leisure to fear if otherwise i perceive that a i engage far in my disease i naturally enter into a certain loathing and disdain of life i find i have much more ado to digest this resolution of die when i be well in health than when languishing of a fever and by how much i have less to do with the commodity of life by reason that i begin to lose the use and pleasure of them by so much i look upon death with less terror which make me hope that the further i remove from the first and the nearer i approach to the latter i shall the more easily exchange the one for the other and a i have experience in other occurrence that a caesar say thing often appear great to u at distance than near at hand i have find that be well i have have malady in much great horror than when really afflict with them the vigour wherein i now be the cheerfulness and delight wherein i now live make the contrary estate appear in so great a disproportion to my present condition that by imagination i magnify those inconvenience by onehalf and apprehend them to be much more troublesome than i find them really to be when they lie the most heavy upon me i hope to find death the same let u but observe in the ordinary change and declination we daily suffer how nature deprive u of the light and sense of our bodily decay what remain to an old man of the vigour of hi youth and good day caesar to an old weatherbeaten soldier of hi guard who come to ask him leave that he might kill himself take notice of hi withered body and decrepit motion pleasantly answer thou fancy then that thou art yet alive should a man fall into this condition on the sudden i do not think humanity capable of endure such a change but nature lead u by the hand an easy and a it be an insensible pace step by step conduct u to that miserable state and by that mean make it familiar to u so that we be insensible of the stroke when our youth die in u though it be really a hard death than the final dissolution of a languish body than the death of old age forasmuch a the fall be not so great from an uneasy be to none at all a it be from a sprightly and flourish be to one that be troublesome and painful the body bent and bow have less force to support a burden and it be the same with the soul and therefore it be that we be to raise her up firm and erect against the power of this adversary for a it be impossible she should ever be at rest whilst she stand in fear of it so if she once can assure herself she may boast which be a thing a it be surpass human condition that it be impossible that disquiet anxiety or fear or any other disturbance should inhabit or have any place in her she be then become sovereign of all her lust and passion mistress of necessity shame poverty and all the other injury of fortune let u therefore a many of u a can get this advantage tis the true and sovereign liberty here on earth that fortify u wherewithal to defy violence and injustice and to contemn prison and chain our very religion itself have no surer human foundation than the contempt of death not only the argument of reason invite u to itfor why should we fear to lose a thing which be lose can not be lament but also see we be threaten by so many sort of death be it not infinitely worse eternally to fear them all than once to undergo one of them and what matter it when it shall happen since it be inevitable to him that tell socrates the thirty tyrant have sentence thee to death and nature them say he what a ridiculous thing it be to trouble ourselves about take the only step that be to deliver u from all trouble a our birth bring u the birth of all thing so in our death be the death of all thing include and therefore to lament that we shall not be alive a hundred year hence be the same folly a to be sorry we be not alive a hundred year ago death be the beginning of another life so do we weep and so much it cost u to enter into this and so do we put off our former veil in enter into it nothing can be a grievance that be but once be it reasonable so long to fear a thing that will so soon be despatch long life and short be by death make all one for there be no long nor short to thing that be no more aristotle tell u that there be certain little beast upon the bank of the river hypanis that never live above a day they which die at eight of the clock in the morning die in their youth and those that die at five in the evening in their decrepitude which of u would not laugh to see this moment of continuance put into the consideration of weal or woe the most and the least of ours in comparison with eternity or yet with the duration of mountain river star tree and even of some animal be no less ridiculous but nature compels u to it go out of this world say she a you enter into it the same pas you make from death to life without passion or fear the same after the same manner repeat from life to death your death be a part of the order of the universe ti a part of the life of the world shall i exchange for you this beautiful contexture of thing ti the condition of your creation death be a part of you and whilst you endeavour to evade it you evade yourselves this very be of yours that you now enjoy be equally divide betwixt life and death the day of your birth be one day advance towards the grave all the whole time you live you purloin from life and live at the expense of life itself the perpetual work of your life be but to lay the foundation of death you be in death whilst you be in life because you still be after death when you be no more alive or if you have rather have it so you be dead after life but die all the while you live and death handle the die much more rudely than the dead and more sensibly and essentially if you have make your profit of life you have have enough of it go your way satisfied if you have not know how to make the best use of it if it be unprofitable to you what need you care to lose it to what end would you desire long to keep it life in itself be neither good nor evil it be the scene of good or evil a you make it and if you have live a day you have see all one day be equal and like to all other day there be no other light no other shade this very sun this moon these very star this very order and disposition of thing be the same your ancestor enjoy and that shall also entertain your posterity and come the bad that can come the distribution and variety of all the act of my comedy be perform in a year if you have observe the revolution of my four season they comprehend the infancy the youth the virility and the old age of the world the year have play hi part and know no other art but to begin again it will always be the same thing i be not prepared to create for you any new recreation give place to other a other have give place to you equality be the soul of equity who can complain of be comprehend in the same destiny wherein all be involve besides live as long a you can you shall by that nothing shorten the space you be to be dead ti all to no purpose you shall be every whit a long in the condition you so much fear a if you have die at nurse and yet i will place you in such a condition a you shall have no reason to be displease nor shall you so much a wish for the life you be so concerned about death be less to be fear than nothing if there could be anything less than nothing neither can it any way concern you whether you be live or dead living by reason that you be still in be dead because you be no more moreover no one die before hi hour the time you leave behind be no more yours than that be lapse and go before you come into the world nor do it any more concern you wherever your life end it be all there the utility of living consist not in the length of day but in the use of time a man may have live long and yet live but a little make use of time while it be present with you it depend upon your will and not upon the number of day to have a sufficient length of life be it possible you can imagine never to arrive at the place towards which you be continually go and yet there be no journey but hath it end and if company will make it more pleasant or more easy to you do not all the world go the selfsame way doe not all the world dance the same brawl that you do be there anything that do not grow old as well a you a thousand men a thousand animals a thousand other creature die at the same moment that you die to what end should you endeavour to draw back if there be no possibility to evade it you have see example enough of those who have be well pleased to die a thereby deliver from heavy misery but have you ever find any who have be dissatisfy with die it must therefore need be very foolish to condemn a thing you have neither experiment in your own person nor by that of any other why dost thou complain of me and of destiny do we do thee any wrong be it for thee to govern u or for u to govern thee though peradventure thy age may not be accomplish yet thy life be a man of low stature be as much a man a a giant neither men nor their life be measure by the ell chiron refuse to be immortal when he be acquaint with the condition under which he be to enjoy it by the god of time itself and it duration hi father saturn do but seriously consider how much more insupportable and painful an immortal life would be to man than what i have already give him if you have not death you would eternally curse me for have deprive you of it i have mix a little bitterness with it to the end that see of what convenience it be you might not too greedily and indiscreetly seek and embrace it and that you might be so establish in this moderation a neither to nauseate life nor have any antipathy for die which i have decree you shall once do i have temper the one and the other betwixt pleasure and pain it be i that teach thales the most eminent of your sage that to live and to die be indifferent which make him very wisely answer him why then he do not die because say he it be indifferent water earth air and fire and the other part of this creation of mine be no more instrument of thy life than they be of thy death why dost thou fear thy last day it contribute no more to thy dissolution than every one of the rest the last step be not the cause of lassitude it do not confess it every day travel towards death the last only arrive at it these be the good lesson our mother nature teach i have often consider with myself whence it should proceed that in war the image of death whether we look upon it in ourselves or in other should without comparison appear less dreadful than at home in our own house for if it be not so it would be an army of doctor and whine milksop and that be still in all place the same there should be notwithstanding much more assurance in peasant and the meaner sort of people than in other of good quality i believe in truth that it be those terrible ceremony and preparation wherewith we set it out that more terrify u than the thing itself a new quite contrary way of live the cry of mother wife and child the visit of astounded and afflicted friend the attendance of pale and blubbering servant a dark room set round with burn taper our bed environ with physician and divine in sum nothing but ghostliness and horror round about u we seem dead and bury already child be afraid even of those they be best acquaint with when disguise in a visor and so tis with u the visor must be remove as well from thing a from person that be take away we shall find nothing underneath but the very same death that a mean servant or a poor chambermaid die a day or two ago without any manner of apprehension happy be the death that deprive u of leisure for prepare such ceremonial i be one of those who be most sensible of the power of imagination every one be jostle by it but some be overthrow by it it have a very piercing impression upon me and i make it my business to avoid want force to resist it i could live by the sole help of healthful and jolly company the very sight of anothers pain materially pain me and i often usurp the sensation of another person a perpetual cough in another tickle my lung and throat i more unwillingly visit the sick in whom by love and duty i be interested than those i care not for to whom i less look i take possession of the disease i be concern at and take it to myself i do not at all wonder that fancy should give fever and sometimes kill such a allow it too much scope and be too willing to entertain it simon thomas be a great physician of hi time i remember that happen one day at toulouse to meet him at a rich old fellow house who be trouble with weak lung and discourse with the patient about the method of hi cure he tell him that one thing which would be very conducive to it be to give me such occasion to be please with hi company that i might come often to see him by which mean and by fix hi eye upon the freshness of my complexion and hi imagination upon the sprightliness and vigour that glow in my youth and possess all hi sens with the flourishing age wherein i then be hi habit of body might peradventure be amend but he forget to say that mine at the same time might be make bad gallus vibius so much bent hi mind to find out the essence and motion of madness that in the end he himself go out of hi wit and to such a degree that he could never after recover hi judgment and might brag that he be become a fool by too much wisdom some there be who through fear anticipate the hangman and there be the man whose eye be unbound to have hi pardon read to him be find stark dead upon the scaffold by the stroke of imagination we start tremble turn pale and blush a we be variously move by imagination and be abed feel our body agitate with it power to that degree a even sometimes to expire and boil youth when fast asleep grows so warm with fancy a in a dream to satisfy amorous desire although it be no new thing to see horn grow in a night on the forehead of one that have none when he go to bed notwithstanding what befell cippus king of italy be memorable who have one day be a very delighted spectator of a bullfight and have all the night dream that he have horn on hi head do by the force of imagination really cause them to grow there passion give to the son of croesus the voice which nature have deny him and antiochus fell into a fever inflame with the beauty of stratonice too deeply imprint in hi soul pliny pretend to have see lucius cossitius who from a woman be turn into a man upon her very weddingday pontanus and other report the like metamorphosis to have happen in these latter day in italy and through the vehement desire of him and hi mother myself passing by vitry le francois saw a man the bishop of soissons have in confirmation call germain whom all the inhabitant of the place have know to be a girl till twoandtwenty year of age call mary he be at the time of my be there very full of beard old and not marry he tell u that by strain himself in a leap hi male organ come out and the girl of that place have to this day a song wherein they advise one another not to take too great stride for fear of be turn into men a mary germain be it be no wonder if this sort of accident frequently happen for if imagination have any power in such thing it be so continually and vigorously bent upon this subject that to the end it may not so often relapse into the same thought and violence of desire it be good once for all to give these young wench the thing they long for some attribute the scar of king dagobert and of st francis to the force of imagination it be say that by it body will sometimes be remove from their place and celsus tell u of a priest whose soul would be ravish into such an ecstasy that the body would for a long time remain without sense or respiration st augustine make mention of another who upon the hearing of any lamentable or doleful cry would presently fall into a swoon and be so far out of himself that it be in vain to call bawl in hi ear pinch or burn him till he voluntarily come to himself and then he would say that he have hear voice a it be afar off and do feel when they pinch and burn him and to prove that this be no obstinate dissimulation in defiance of hi sense of feel it be manifest that all the while he have neither pulse nor breathing ti very probable that vision enchantment and all extraordinary effect of that nature derive their credit principally from the power of imagination work and make it chief impression upon vulgar and more easy soul whose belief be so strangely impose upon a to think they see what they do not see i be not satisfied whether those pleasant ligature with which this age of ours be so occupied that there be almost no other talk be not mere voluntary impression of apprehension and fear for i know by experience in the case of a particular friend of mine one for whom i can be as responsible a for myself and a man that can not possibly fall under any manner of suspicion of insufficiency and a little of be enchant who have hear a companion of hi make a relation of an unusual frigidity that surprise him at a very unseasonable time be afterwards himself engage upon the same account the horror of the former story on a sudden so strangely possess hi imagination that he run the same fortune the other have do and from that time forward the scurvy remembrance of hi disaster run in hi mind and tyrannise over him he be subject to relapse into the same misfortune he find some remedy however for this fancy in another fancy by himself frankly confess and declare beforehand to the party with whom he be to have to do this subjection of hi by which mean the agitation of hi soul be in some sort appease and know that now some such misbehaviour be expect from him the restraint upon hi faculty grow less and afterwards at such time a he be in no such apprehension when set about the act hi thought be then disengage and free and hi body in it true and natural estate he be at leisure to cause the part to be handle and communicate to the knowledge of the other party he be totally free from that vexatious infirmity after a man have once do a woman right he be never after in danger of misbehave himself with that person unless upon the account of some excusable weakness neither be this disaster to be fear but in adventure where the soul be overextend with desire or respect and especially where the opportunity be of an unforeseen and pressing nature in those case there be no mean for a man to defend himself from such a surprise a shall put him altogether out of sort i have know some who have secure themselves from this mischance by come half sate elsewhere purposely to abate the ardour of the fury and other who be grow old find themselves less impotent by be less able and one who find an advantage in be assure by a friend of hi that he have a countercharm of enchantment that would secure him from this disgrace the story itself be not much amiss and therefore you shall have it a count of a very great family and with whom i be very intimate be marry to a fair lady who have formerly be court by one who be at the wed all hi friend be in very great fear but especially an old lady hi kinswoman who have the ordering of the solemnity and in whose house it be keep suspect hi rival would offer foul play by these sorcery which fear she communicate to me i bid her rely upon me i have by chance about me a certain flat plate of gold whereon be grave some celestial figure suppose good against sunstroke or pain in the head be apply to the suture where that it might the good remain firm it be sew to a ribbon to be tie under the chin a foppery cousingerman to this of which i be speak jaques pelletier who live in my house have present this to me for a singular rarity i have a fancy to make some use of this knack and therefore privately tell the count that he might possibly run the same fortune other bridegroom have sometimes do especially some one be in the house who no doubt would be glad to do him such a courtesy but let him boldly go to bed for i would do him the office of a friend and if need be would not spare a miracle it be in my power to do provide he would engage to me upon hi honour to keep it to himself and only when they come to bring him hi caudle if matter have not go well with him to give me such a sign and leave the rest to me now he have have hi ear so battered and hi mind so prepossessed with the eternal tattle of this business that when he come tot he do really find himself tie with the trouble of hi imagination and accordingly at the time appoint give me the sign whereupon i whisper him in the ear that he should rise under pretence of put u out of the room and after a jesting manner pull my nightgown from my shoulderswe be of much about the same height throw it over hi own and there keep it till he have perform what i have appoint him to do which be that when we be all go out of the chamber he should withdraw to make water should three time repeat such and such word and as often do such and such action that at every of the three time he should tie the ribbon i put into hi hand about hi middle and be sure to place the medal that be fasten to it the figure in such a posture exactly upon hi rein which be do and have the last of the three time so well girt and fast tie the ribbon that it could neither untie nor slip from it place let him confidently return to hi business and withal not forget to spread my gown upon the bed so that it might be sure to cover them both these ape trick be the main of the effect our fancy be so far seduce a to believe that such strange mean must of necessity proceed from some abstruse science their very inanity give them weight and reverence and certain it be that my figure approve themselves more venereal than solar more active than prohibitive twas a sudden whimsey mixed with a little curiosity that make me do a thing so contrary to my nature for i be an enemy to all subtle and counterfeit action and abominate all manner of trickery though it be for sport and to an advantage for though the action may not be vicious in itself it mode be vicious amasis king of egypt have marry laodice a very beautiful greek virgin though note for hi ability elsewhere find himself quite another man with hi wife and could by no mean enjoy her at which he be so enraged that he threaten to kill her suspect her to be a witch a ti usual in thing that consist in fancy she put him upon devotion and have accordingly make hi vow to venus he find himself divinely restore the very first night after hi oblation and sacrifice now woman be to blame to entertain u with that disdainful coy and angry countenance which extinguish our vigour a it kindle our desire which make the daughterinlaw of pythagoras say that the woman who go to bed to a man must put off her modesty with her petticoat and put it on again with the same the soul of the assailant be disturb with many several alarm readily lose the power of performance and whoever the imagination have once put this trick upon and confound with the shame of it and she never do it but at the first acquaintance by reason men be then more ardent and eager and also at this first account a man give of himself he be much more timorous of miscarry have make an ill begin he enter into such fever and despite at the accident a be apt to remain and continue with him upon follow occasion married people have all their time before them ought never to compel or so much a to offer at the feat if they do not find themselves quite ready and it be less unseemly to fail of handselling the nuptial sheet when a man perceive himself full of agitation and trembling and to await another opportunity at more private and more composed leisure than to make himself perpetually miserable for have misbehave himself and be baffle at the first assault till possession be take a man that know himself subject to this infirmity should leisurely and by degree make several little trial and light offer without obstinately attempt at once to force an absolute conquest over hi own mutinous and indisposed faculty such a know their member to be naturally obedient need take no other care but only to counterplot their fantasy the indocile liberty of this member be very remarkable so importunately unruly in it tumidity and impatience when we do not require it and so unseasonably disobedient when we stand most in need of it so imperiously contest in authority with the will and with so much haughty obstinacy deny all solicitation both of hand and mind and yet though hi rebellion be so universally complain of and that proof be thence deduce to condemn him if he have nevertheless fee me to plead hi cause i should peradventure bring the rest of hi fellowmembers into suspicion of complot this mischief against him out of pure envy at the importance and pleasure especial to hi employment and to have by confederacy arm the whole world against him by malevolently charge him alone with their common offence for let any one consider whether there be any one part of our body that do not often refuse to perform it office at the precept of the will and that do not often exercise it function in defiance of her command they have every one of them passion of their own that rouse and awaken stupefy and benumb them without our leave or consent how often do the involuntary motion of the countenance discover our inward thought and betray our most private secret to the bystander the same cause that animate this member do also without our knowledge animate the lung pulse and heart the sight of a pleasing object imperceptibly diffuse a flame through all our part with a feverish motion be there nothing but these vein and muscle that swell and flag without the consent not only of the will but even of our knowledge also we do not command our hair to stand on end nor our skin to shiver either with fear or desire the hand often convey themselves to part to which we do not direct them the tongue will be interdict and the voice congeal when we know not how to help it when we have nothing to eat and would willingly forbid it the appetite do not for all that forbear to stir up the part that be subject to it no more nor less than the other appetite we be speak of and in like manner a unseasonably leaf u when it think fit the vessel that serve to discharge the belly have their own proper dilatation and compression without and beyond our concurrence as well a those which be destine to purge the rein and that which to justify the prerogative of the will st augustine urge of have see a man who could command hi rear to discharge as often together a he please vives hi commentator yet further fortifies with another example in hi timeof one that could break wind in tune but these case do not suppose any more pure obedience in that part for be anything commonly more tumultuary or indiscreet to which let me add that i myself know one so rude and ungoverned a for forty year together make hi master vent with one continued and unintermitted outburst and ti like will do so till he die of it and i could heartily wish that i only know by read how often a man belly by the denial of one single puff bring him to the very door of an exceed painful death and that the emperor who give liberty to let fly in all place have at the same time give u power to do it but for our will in whose behalf we prefer this accusation with how much great probability may we reproach herself with mutiny and sedition for her irregularity and disobedience doe she always will what we would have her to do doe she not often will what we forbid her to will and that to our manifest prejudice do she suffer herself more than any of the rest to be govern and direct by the result of our reason to conclude i should move in the behalf of the gentleman my client it might be consider that in this fact hi cause be inseparably and indistinctly conjoin with an accessory yet he only be call in question and that by argument and accusation which can not be charge upon the other whose business indeed it be sometimes inopportunely to invite but never to refuse and invite moreover after a tacit and quiet manner and therefore be the malice and injustice of hi accuser most manifestly apparent but be it how it will protest against the proceeding of the advocate and judge nature will in the meantime proceed after her own way who have do but well have she endow this member with some particular privilege the author of the sole immortal work of mortal a divine work accord to socrates and love the desire of immortality and himself an immortal demon some one perhaps by such an effect of imagination may have have the good luck to leave behind him here the scrofula which hi companion who have come after have carry with him into spain and ti for this reason you may see why men in such case require a mind prepare for the thing that be to be do why do the physician posse before hand their patient credulity with so many false promise of cure if not to the end that the effect of imagination may supply the imposture of their decoction they know very well that a great master of their trade have give it under hi hand that he have know some with whom the very sight of physic would work all which conceits come now into my head by the remembrance of a story be tell me by a domestic apothecary of my father a blunt swiss a nation not much addict to vanity and lying of a merchant he have long know at toulouse who be a valetudinary and much afflict with the stone have often occasion to take clyster of which he cause several sort to be prescribe him by the physician acccording to the accident of hi disease which be bring him and none of the usual form a feeling if it be not too hot and the like be omit he lay down the syringe advance and all ceremony perform injection alone except after which the apothecary be go and the patient accommodate a if he have really receive a clyster he find the same operation and effect that those do who have take one indeed and if at any time the physician do not find the operation sufficient he would usually give him two or three more dos after the same manner and the fellow swear that to save charge for he pay a if he have really take them this sick man wife have sometimes make trial of warm water only the effect discover the cheat and find these would do no good be fain to return to the old way a woman fancy she have swallow a pin in a piece of bread cry and lament a though she have an intolerable pain in her throat where she think she felt it stick but an ingenious fellow that be bring to her see no outward tumour nor alteration suppose it to be only a conceit take at some crust of bread that have hurt her a it go down cause her to vomit and unseen throw a crooked pin into the basin which the woman no sooner saw but believe she have cast it up she presently find herself ease of her pain i myself know a gentleman who have treat a large company at hi house three or four day after brag in jest for there be no such thing that he have make them eat of a baked cat at which a young gentlewoman who have be at the feast take such a horror that fall into a violent vomiting and fever there be no possible mean to save her even brute beast be subject to the force of imagination as well a we witness dog who die of grief for the loss of their master and bark and tremble and start in their sleep so horse will kick and whinny in their sleep now all this may be attribute to the close affinity and relation betwixt the soul and the body intercommunicate their fortune but ti quite another thing when the imagination work not only upon one own particular body but upon that of other also and a an infected body communicate it malady to those that approach or live near it a we see in the plague the smallpox and sore eye that run through whole family and city so the imagination be vehemently agitate dart out infection capable of offend the foreign object the ancient have an opinion of certain woman of scythia that be animate and enrage against any one they kill him only with their look tortoise and ostrich hatch their egg with only look on them which infers that their eye have in them some ejaculative virtue and the eye of witch be say to be assailant and hurtful magician be no very good authority with me but we experimentally see that woman impart the mark of their fancy to the child they carry in the womb witness her that be bring to bed of a moor and there be present to charles the emperor and king of bohemia a girl from about pisa all over rough and cover with hair whom her mother say to be so conceive by reason of a picture of st john the baptist that hung within the curtain of her bed it be the same with beast witness jacob sheep and the hare and partridge that the snow turn white upon the mountain there be at my house a little while ago a cat see watch a bird upon the top of a tree these for some time mutually fix their eye one upon another the bird at last let herself fall dead into the cat claw either dazzle by the force of it own imagination or draw by some attractive power of the cat such a be addict to the pleasure of the field have i make no question hear the story of the falconer who have earnestly fix hi eye upon a kite in the air lay a wager that he would bring her down with the sole power of hi sight and do so a it be say for the tale i borrow i charge upon the conscience of those from whom i have them the discourse be my own and find themselves upon the proof of reason not of experience to which every one have liberty to add hi own example and who have none let him not forbear the number and variety of accident consider to believe that there be plenty of them if i do not apply them well let some other do it for me and also in the subject of which i treat our manner and motion testimony and instance how fabulous soever provide they be possible serve as well a the true whether they have really happen or no at rome or paris to john or peter ti still within the verge of human capacity which serve me to good use i see and make my advantage of it as well in shadow a in substance and amongst the various reading thereof in history i cull out the most rare and memorable to fit my own turn there be author whose only end and design it be to give an account of thing that have happen mine if i could arrive unto it should be to deliver of what may happen there be a just liberty allow in the school of suppose similitude when they have none at hand i do not however make any use of that privilege and a to that matter in superstitious religion surpass all historical authority in the example which i here bring in of what i have hear read do or say i have forbid myself to dare to alter even the most light and indifferent circumstance my conscience do not falsify one tittle what my ignorance may do i can not say and this it be that make me sometimes doubt in my own mind whether a divine or a philosopher and such men of exact and tender prudence and conscience be fit to write history for how can they stake their reputation upon a popular faith how be responsible for the opinion of men they do not know and with what assurance deliver their conjecture for current pay of action perform before their own eye wherein several person be actor they would be unwilling to give evidence upon oath before a judge and there be no man so familiarly know to them for whose intention they would become absolute caution for my part i think it less hazardous to write of thing past than present by how much the writer be only to give an account of thing every one know he must of necessity borrow upon trust i be solicit to write the affair of my own time by some who fancy i look upon them with an eye less blind with passion than another and have a clear insight into them by reason of the free access fortune have give me to the head of various faction but they do not consider that to purchase the glory of sallust i would not give myself the trouble sworn enemy a i be to obligation assiduity or perseverance that there be nothing so contrary to my style a a continued narrative i so often interrupt and cut myself short in my writing for want of breath i have neither composition nor explanation worth anything and be ignorant beyond a child of the phrase and even the very word proper to express the most common thing and for that reason it be that i have undertake to say only what i can say and have accommodate my subject to my strength should i take one to be my guide peradventure i should not be able to keep pace with him and in the freedom of my liberty might deliver judgment which upon good thought and accord to reason would be illegitimate and punishable plutarch would say of what he have deliver to u that it be the work of other that hi example be all and everywhere exactly true that they be useful to posterity and be present with a lustre that will light u the way to virtue be hi own work it be not of so dangerous consequence a in a medicinal drug whether an old story be so or so demades the athenian condemn one of hi city whose trade it be to sell the necessary for funeral ceremony upon pretence that he demand unreasonable profit and that that profit could not accrue to him but by the death of a great number of people a judgment that appear to be ill ground forasmuch a no profit whatever can possibly be make but at the expense of another and that by the same rule he should condemn all gain of what kind soever the merchant only thrive by the debauchery of youth the husband man by the dearness of grain the architect by the ruin of building lawyer and officer of justice by the suit and contention of men nay even the honour and office of divine be derive from our death and vices a physician take no pleasure in the health even of hi friend say the ancient greek comic writer nor a soldier in the peace of hi country and so of the rest and which be yet bad let every one but dive into hi own bosom and he will find hi private wish spring and hi secret hope grow up at anothers expense upon which consideration it come into my head that nature do not in this swerve from her general polity for physician hold that the birth nourishment and increase of every thing be the dissolution and corruption of another he seem to me to have have a right and true apprehension of the power of custom who first invent the story of a countrywoman who have accustom herself to play with and carry a young calf in her arm and daily continue to do so a it grow up obtain this by custom that when grow to be a great ox she be still able to bear it for in truth custom be a violent and treacherous schoolmistress she by little and little slily and unperceived slip in the foot of her authority but have by this gentle and humble beginning with the benefit of time fix and establish it she then unmask a furious and tyrannic countenance against which we have no more the courage or the power so much a to lift up our eye we see her at every turn force and violate the rule of nature i refer to her plato cave in hi republic and the physician who so often submit the reason of their art to her authority a the story of that king who by custom bring hi stomach to that pas a to live by poison and the maid that albertus report to have live upon spider in that new world of the indie there be find great nation and in very differ climate who be of the same diet make provision of them and feed them for their table a also they do grasshopper mice lizard and bat and in a time of scarcity of such delicacy a toad be sell for six crown all which they cook and dish up with several sauce there be also other find to whom our diet and the flesh we eat be venomous and mortal these strange example will not appear so strange if we consider what we have ordinary experience of how much custom stupefy our sens we need not go to what be report of the people about the cataract of the nile and what philosopher believe of the music of the sphere that the body of those circle be solid and smooth and come to touch and rub upon one another can not fail of create a marvellous harmony the change and cadence of which cause the revolution and dance of the star but that the hearing sense of all creature here below be universally like that of the egyptian deafen and stupefy with the continual noise can not how great soever perceive it smith millers pewter forgemen and armourer could never be able to live in the perpetual noise of their own trade do it strike their ear with the same violence that it do ours my perfumed doublet gratifies my own scent at first but after i have wear it three day together tis only please to the bystander this be yet more strange that custom notwithstanding long intermission and interval should yet have the power to unite and establish the effect of it impression upon our sens a be manifest in such a live near unto steeple and the frequent noise of the bell i myself lie at home in a tower where every morning and even a very great bell ring out the ave maria the noise shake my very tower and at first seem insupportable to me but i be so used to it that i hear it without any manner of offence and often without awake at it plato reprehend a boy for play at nut thou reprovest me say the boy for a very little thing custom reply plato be no little thing i find that our great vice derive their first propensity from our most tender infancy and that our principal education depend upon the nurse mother be mightily pleased to see a child writhe off the neck of a chicken or to please itself with hurt a dog or a cat and such wise father there be in the world who look upon it a a notable mark of a martial spirit when they hear a son miscall or see him domineer over a poor peasant or a lackey that dare not reply nor turn again and a great sign of wit when they see him cheat and overreach hi playfellow by some malicious treachery and deceit yet these be the true seed and root of cruelty tyranny and treason they bud and put out there and afterwards shoot up vigorously and grow to prodigious bulk cultivate by custom and it be a very dangerous mistake to excuse these vile inclination upon the tenderness of their age and the triviality of the subject first it be nature that speak whose declaration be then more sincere and inward thought more undisguised a it be more weak and young secondly the deformity of cozenage do not consist nor depend upon the difference betwixt crown and pin but i rather hold it more just to conclude thus why should he not cozen in crown since he do it in pin than a they do who say they only play for pin they would not do it if it be for money child should carefully be instruct to abhor vice for their own contexture and the natural deformity of those vice ought so to be represent to them that they may not only avoid them in their action but especially so to abominate them in their heart that the very thought should be hateful to them with what mask soever they may be disguise i know very well for what concern myself that from have be bring up in my childhood to a plain and straightforward way of deal and from have have an aversion to all manner of juggling and foul play in my childish sport and recreation and indeed it be to be note that the play of child be not perform in play but be to be judge in them a their most serious action there be no game so small wherein from my own bosom naturally and without study or endeavour i have not an extreme aversion from deceit i shuffle and cut and make as much clatter with the card and keep a strict account for farthing a it be for double pistol when win or lose against my wife and daughter ti indifferent to me a when i play in good earnest with other for round sum at all time and in all place my own eye be sufficient to look to my finger i be not so narrowly watch by any other neither be there any i have more respect to i saw the other day at my own house a little fellow a native of nantes bear without arm who have so well taught hi foot to perform the service hi hand should have do him that truly these have half forget their natural office and indeed the fellow call them hi hand with them he cut anything charge and discharge a pistol thread a needle sews writes put off hi hat comb hi head play at card and dice and all this with as much dexterity a any other could do who have more and more proper limb to assist him the money i give himfor he gain hi living by shew these featshe take in hi foot a we do in our hand i have see another who be yet a boy flourish a twohanded sword and if i may so say handle a halberd with the mere motion of hi neck and shoulder for want of hand toss them into the air and catch them again dart a dagger and crack a whip as well a any coachman in france but the effect of custom be much more manifest in the strange impression she imprint in our mind where she meet with less resistance what have she not the power to impose upon our judgment and belief is there any so fantastic opinion omit the gross imposture of religion with which we see so many great nation and so many understand men so strangely besotted for this be beyond the reach of human reason any error be more excusable in such a be not endue through the divine bounty with an extraordinary illumination from above but of other opinion be there any so extravagant that she have not plant and establish for law in those part of the world upon which she have be please to exercise her power and therefore that ancient exclamation be exceed just i do believe that no so absurd or ridiculous fancy can enter into human imagination that do not meet with some example of public practice and that consequently our reason do not grind and back up there be people amongst whom it be the fashion to turn their back upon him they salute and never look upon the man they intend to honour there be a place where whenever the king spit the great lady of hi court put out their hand to receive it and another nation where the most eminent person about him stoop to take up hi ordure in a linen cloth let u here steal room to insert a story a french gentleman be always wont to blow hi nose with hi finger a thing very much against our fashion and he justify himself for so do and he be a man famous for pleasant repartee he ask me what privilege this filthy excrement have that we must carry about u a fine handkerchief to receive it and which be more afterwards to lap it carefully up and carry it all day about in our pocket which he say could not but be much more nauseous and offensive than to see it thrown away a we do all other evacuation i find that what he say be not altogether without reason and by be frequently in hi company that slovenly action of hi be at last grown familiar to me which nevertheless we make a face at when we hear it report of another country miracle appear to be so accord to our ignorance of nature and not accord to the essence of nature the continually be accustom to anything blind the eye of our judgment barbarian be no more a wonder to u than we be to them nor with any more reason a every one would confess if after have travel over those remote example men could settle themselves to reflect upon and rightly to confer them with their own human reason be a tincture almost equally infuse into all our opinion and manner of what form soever they be infinite in matter infinite in diversity but i return to my subject there be people where hi wife and child except no one speak to the king but through a tube in one and the same nation the virgin discover those part that modesty should persuade them to hide and the married woman carefully cover and conceal them to which this custom in another place have some relation where chastity but in marriage be of no esteem for unmarried woman may prostitute themselves to as many a they please and be get with child may lawfully take physic in the sight of every one to destroy their fruit and in another place if a tradesman marry all of the same condition who be invite to the wed lie with the bride before him and the great number of them there be the great be her honour and the opinion of her ability and strength if an officer marry tis the same the same with a labourer or one of mean condition but then it belong to the lord of the place to perform that office and yet a severe loyalty during marriage be afterward strictly enjoin there be place where brothel of young men be keep for the pleasure of woman where the wife go to war as well a the husband and not only share in the danger of battle but moreover in the honour of command other where they wear ring not only through their nose lips cheek and on their toe but also weighty gimmals of gold thrust through their pap and buttock where in eat they wipe their finger upon their thigh genitories and the sol of their foot where child be exclude and brother and nephew only inherit and elsewhere nephews only save in the succession of the prince where for the regulation of community in good and estates observe in the country certain sovereign magistrate have commit to them the universal charge and overseeing of the agriculture and distribution of the fruit accord to the necessity of every one where they lament the death of child and feast at the decease of old men where they lie ten or twelve in a bed men and their wife together where woman whose husband come to violent end may marry again and other not where the condition of woman be looked upon with such contempt that they kill all the native female and buy wife of their neighbour to supply their use where husband may repudiate their wife without show any cause but wife can not part from their husband for what cause soever where husband may sell their wife in case of sterility where they boil the body of their dead and afterward pound them to a pulp which they mix with their wine and drink it where the most coveted sepulture be to be eat by dog and elsewhere by bird where they believe the soul of the blessed live in all manner of liberty in delightful field furnish with all sort of delicacy and that it be these soul repeat the word we utter which we call echo where they fight in the water and shoot their arrow with the most mortal aim swimming where for a sign of subjection they lift up their shoulder and hang down their head where they put off their shoe when they enter the king palace where the eunuch who take charge of the sacred woman have moreover their lip and nose cut off that they may not be love where the priest put out their own eye to be well acquaint with their demon and the good to receive their oracle where every one make to himself a deity of what he like best the hunter of a lion or a fox the fisher of some fish idol of every human action or passion in which place the sun the moon and the earth be the principal deity and the form of take an oath be to touch the earth look up to heaven where both flesh and fish be eaten raw where the great oath they take be to swear by the name of some dead person of reputation lay their hand upon hi tomb where the newyears gift the king send every year to the prince hi vassal be fire which be bring all the old fire be put out and the neighbouring people be bind to fetch of the new every one for themselves upon pain of high treason where when the king to betake himself wholly to devotion retires from hi administration which often fall out hi next successor be oblige to do the same and the right of the kingdom devolve to the third in succession where they vary the form of government accord to the seem necessity of affair depose the king when they think good substitute certain elder to govern in hi stead and sometimes transfer it into the hand of the commonality where men and woman be both circumcised and also baptize where the soldier who in one or several engagement have be so fortunate a to present seven of the enemy head to the king be make noble where they live in that rare and unsociable opinion of the mortality of the soul where the woman be deliver without pain or fear where the woman wear copper legging upon both leg and if a louse bite them be bind in magnanimity to bite them again and dare not marry till first they have make their king a tender of their virginity if he please to accept it where the ordinary way of salutation be by put a finger down to the earth and then point it up toward heaven where men carry burden upon their head and woman on their shoulder where the woman make water standing and the men squat where they send their blood in token of friendship and offer incense to the men they would honour like god where not only to the fourth but in any other remote degree kindred be not permit to marry where the child be four year at nurse and often twelve in which place also it be account mortal to give the child suck the first day after it be bear where the correction of the male child be peculiarly design to the father and to the mother of the girl the punishment be to hang them by the heel in the smoke where they circumcise the woman where they eat all sort of herb without other scruple than of the badness of the smell where all thing be open the fine house furnish in the rich manner without door windows trunk or chest to lock a thief be there punish double what they be in other place where they crack louse with their teeth like monkey and abhor to see them kill with one nail where in all their life they neither cut their hair nor pare their nail and in another place pare those of the right hand only let the left grow for ornament and bravery where they suffer the hair on the right side to grow as long a it will and shave the other and in the neighbouring provinces some let their hair grow long before and some behind shave close the rest where parent let out their child and husband their wife to their guest to hire where a man may get hi own mother with child and father make use of their own daughter or son without scandal where at their solemn feast they interchangeably lend their child to one another without any consideration of nearness of blood in one place men fee upon human flesh in another ti repute a pious office for a man to kill hi father at a certain age elsewhere the father dispose of their child whilst yet in their mother wombs some to be preserve and carefully bring up and other to be abandon or make away elsewhere the old husband lend their wife to young men and in another place they be in common without offence in one place particularly the woman take it for a mark of honour to have as many gay fringe tassel at the bottom of their garment a they have lie with several men moreover have not custom make a republic of woman separately by themselves have it not put arm into their hand and make them raise army and fight battle and do she not by her own precept instruct the most ignorant vulgar and make them perfect in thing which all the philosophy in the world could never beat into the head of the wise men for we know entire nation where death be not only despised but entertain with the great triumph where child of seven year old suffer themselves to be whip to death without change countenance where rich be in such contempt that the mean citizen would not have deign to stoop to take up a purse of crown and we know region very fruitful in all manner of provision where notwithstanding the most ordinary diet and that they be most pleased with be only bread cress and water did not custom moreover work that miracle in chios that in seven hundred year it be never know that ever maid or wife commit any act to the prejudice of her honour to conclude there be nothing in my opinion that she do not or may not do and therefore with very good reason it be that pindar call her the ruler of the world he that be see to beat hi father and reprove for so do make answer that it be the custom of their family that in like manner hi father have beat hi grandfather hi grandfather hi greatgrandfather and this say he point to hi son when he come to my age shall beat me and the father whom the son drag and haul along the street command him to stop at a certain door for he himself he say have drag hi father no farther that be the utmost limit of the hereditary outrage the son use to practise upon the father in their family it be as much by custom a infirmity say aristotle that woman tear their hair bite their nail and eat coal and earth and more by custom than nature that men abuse themselves with one another the law of conscience which we pretend to be derive from nature proceed from custom every one have an inward veneration for the opinion and manner approve and receive amongst hi own people can not without very great reluctance depart from them nor apply himself to them without applause in time past when those of crete would curse any one they pray the god to engage him in some ill custom but the principal effect of it power be so to seize and ensnare u that it be hardly in u to disengage ourselves from it gripe or so to come to ourselves a to consider of and to weigh the thing it enjoin to say the truth by reason that we suck it in with our milk and that the face of the world present itself in this posture to our first sight it seem a if we be bear upon condition to follow on this track and the common fancy that we find in repute everywhere about u and infuse into our mind with the seed of our father appear to be the most universal and genuine from whence it come to pass that whatever be off the hinge of custom be believe to be also off the hinge of reason how unreasonably for the most part god know if a we who study ourselves have learn to do every one who hear a good sentence would immediately consider how it do in any way touch hi own private concern every one would find that it be not so much a good saying a a severe lash to the ordinary stupidity of hi own judgment but men receive the precept and admonition of truth a direct to the common sort and never to themselves and instead of apply them to their own manner do only very ignorantly and unprofitably commit them to memory but let u return to the empire of custom such people a have be breed up to liberty and subject to no other dominion but the authority of their own will look upon all other form of government a monstrous and contrary to nature those who be inure to monarchy do the same and what opportunity soever fortune present them with to change even then when with the great difficulty they have disengage themselves from one master that be troublesome and grievous to them they presently run with the same difficulty to create another be unable to take into hatred subjection itself ti by the mediation of custom that every one be content with the place where he be plant by nature and the highlander of scotland no more pant after touraine than the scythian after thessaly darius ask certain greek what they would take to assume the custom of the indian of eat the dead body of their father for that be their use believing they could not give them a good nor more noble sepulture than to bury them in their own body they make answer that nothing in the world should hire them to do it but have also try to persuade the indian to leave their custom and after the greek manner to burn the body of their father they conceive a still great horror at the motion every one do the same for use veil from u the true aspect of thing take upon me once to justify something in use amongst u and that be receive with absolute authority for a great many league round about u and not content a men commonly do to establish it only by force of law and example but inquire still far into it origin i find the foundation so weak that i who make it my business to confirm other be very near be dissatisfy myself ti by this receipt that plato undertake to cure the unnatural and preposterous love of hi time a one which he esteem of sovereign virtue namely that the public opinion condemn them that the poet and all other sort of writer relate horrible story of them a recipe by virtue of which the most beautiful daughter no more allure their father lust nor brother of the fine shape and fashion their sister desire the very fable of thyestes oedipus and macareus have with the harmony of their song infuse this wholesome opinion and belief into the tender brain of child chastity be in truth a great and shin virtue and of which the utility be sufficiently know but to treat of it and to set it off in it true value accord to nature be as hard a ti easy to do so accord to custom law and precepts the fundamental and universal reason be of very obscure and difficult research and our master either lightly pass them over or not dare so much a to touch them precipitate themselves into the liberty and protection of custom there puff themselves out and triumph to their heart content such a will not suffer themselves to be withdraw from this original source do yet commit a great error and subject themselves to wild opinion witness chrysippus who in so many of hi writing have strew the little account he make of incestuous conjunction commit with how near relation soever whoever would disengage himself from this violent prejudice of custom would find several thing receive with absolute and undoubting opinion that have no other support than the hoary head and rivelled face of ancient usage but the mask take off and thing be refer to the decision of truth and reason he will find hi judgment a it be altogether overthrown and yet restore to a much more sure estate for example i shall ask him what can be more strange than to see a people oblige to obey law they never understand bound in all their domestic affair a marriage donation will sale and purchase to rule they can not possibly know be neither write nor publish in their own language and of which they be of necessity to purchase both the interpretation and the use not accord to the ingenious opinion of isocrates who counsel hi king to make the traffic and negotiation of hi subject free frank and of profit to them and their quarrel and dispute burdensome and laden with heavy imposition and penalty but by a prodigious opinion to make sale of reason itself and to give to law a course of merchandise i think myself oblige to fortune that a our historian report it be a gascon gentleman a countryman of mine who first oppose charlemagne when he attempt to impose upon u latin and imperial law what can be more savage than to see a nation where by lawful custom the office of a judge be buy and sell where judgment be pay for with ready money and where justice may legitimately be deny to him that have not wherewithal to pay a merchandise in so great repute a in a government to create a fourth estate of wrangle lawyer to add to the three ancient one of the church nobility and people which fourth estate have the law in their own hand and sovereign power over men life and fortune make another body separate from nobility whence it come to pass that there be double law those of honour and those of justice in many thing altogether opposite one to another the noble a rigorously condemn a lie take a the other do a lie revenge by the law of arm he shall be degrade from all nobility and honour who put up with an affront and by the civil law he who vindicate hi reputation by revenge incurs a capital punishment he who apply himself to the law for reparation of an offence do to hi honour disgrace himself and he who do not be censure and punish by the law yet of these two so different thing both of them refer to one head the one have the charge of peace the other of war those have the profit these the honour those the wisdom these the virtue those the word these the action those justice these valour those reason these force those the long robe these the shortdivided betwixt them for what concern indifferent thing a clothes who be there seek to bring them back to their true use which be the bodys service and convenience and upon which their original grace and fitness depend for the most fantastic in my opinion that can be imagine i will instance amongst other our flat cap that long tail of velvet that hang down from our woman head with it partycoloured trapping and that vain and futile model of a member we can not in modesty so much a name which nevertheless we make show and parade of in public these consideration notwithstanding will not prevail upon any understanding man to decline the common mode but on the contrary methinks all singular and particular fashion be rather mark of folly and vain affectation than of sound reason and that a wise man within ought to withdraw and retire hi soul from the crowd and there keep it at liberty and in power to judge freely of thing but a to external absolutely to follow and conform himself to the fashion of the time public society have nothing to do with our thought but the rest a our action our labour our fortune and our life we be to lend and abandon them to it service and to the common opinion a do that good and great socrates who refuse to preserve hi life by a disobedience to the magistrate though a very wicked and unjust one for it be the rule of rule the general law of law that every one observe those of the place wherein he live and now to another point it be a very great doubt whether any so manifest benefit can accrue from the alteration of a law receive let it be what it will a there be danger and inconvenience in alter it forasmuch a government be a structure compose of diver part and member join and unite together with so strict connection that it be impossible to stir so much a one brick or stone but the whole body will be sensible of it the legislator of the thurians ordain that whosoever would go about either to abolish an old law or to establish a new should present himself with a halter about hi neck to the people to the end that if the innovation he would introduce should not be approve by every one he might immediately be hang and he of the lacedaemonians employ hi life to obtain from hi citizen a faithful promise that none of hi law should be violate the ephoros who so rudely cut the two string that phrynis have add to music never stand to examine whether that addition make well harmony or that by it mean the instrument be more full and complete it be enough for him to condemn the invention that it be a novelty and an alteration of the old fashion which also be the meaning of the old rusty sword carry before the magistracy of marseille for my own part i have a great aversion from a novelty what face or what pretence soever it may carry along with it and have reason have be an eyewitness of the great evil it have produce for those which for so many year have lie so heavy upon u it be not wholly accountable but one may say with colour enough that it have accidentally produce and beget the mischief and ruin that have since happen both without and against it it principally we be to accuse for these disorder they who give the first shock to a state be almost naturally the first overwhelm in it ruin the fruit of public commotion be seldom enjoy by him who be the first motor he beat and disturb the water for anothers net the unity and contexture of this monarchy of this grand edifice have be rip and tear in her old age by this thing call innovation have since lay open a rent and give sufficient admittance to such injury the royal majesty with great difficulty decline from the summit to the middle then it fall and tumble headlong from the middle to the bottom but if the inventor do the great mischief the imitator be more vicious to follow example of which they have felt and punish both the horror and the offence and if there can be any degree of honour in illdoing these last must yield to the other the glory of contriving and the courage of make the first attempt all sort of new disorder easily draw from this primitive and everflowing fountain example and precedent to trouble and discompose our government we read in our very law make for the remedy of this first evil the beginning and pretence of all sort of wicked enterprise and that befall u which thucydides say of the civil war of hi time that in favour of public vice they give them new and more plausible name for their excuse sweetening and disguise their true title which must be do forsooth to reform our conscience and belief but the best pretence for innovation be of very dangerous consequence and freely to speak my thought it argue a strange selflove and great presumption to be so fond of one own opinion that a public peace must be overthrow to establish them and to introduce so many inevitable mischief and so dreadful a corruption of manner a a civil war and the mutation of state consequent to it always bring in their train and to introduce them in a thing of so high concern into the bowel of one own country can there be bad husbandry than to set up so many certain and know vice against error that be only contested and disputable and be there any bad sort of vice than those commit against a man own conscience and the natural light of hi own reason the senate upon the dispute betwixt it and the people about the administration of their religion be bold enough to return this evasion for current pay accord to what the oracle answer to those of delphos who fear to be invade by the persian in the median war inquire of apollo how they should dispose of the holy treasure of hi temple whether they should hide or remove it to some other place he return them answer that they should stir nothing from thence and only take care of themselves for he be sufficient to look to what belong to him the christian religion have all the mark of the utmost utility and justice but none more manifest than the severe injunction it lay indifferently upon all to yield absolute obedience to the civil magistrate and to maintain and defend the law of which what a wonderful example have the divine wisdom leave u that to establish the salvation of mankind and to conduct hi glorious victory over death and sin would do it after no other way but at the mercy of our ordinary form of justice subject the progress and issue of so high and so salutiferous an effect to the blindness and injustice of our custom and observance sacrifice the innocent blood of so many of hi elect and so long a loss of so many year to the maturing of this inestimable fruit there be a vast difference betwixt the case of one who follow the form and law of hi country and of another who will undertake to regulate and change them of whom the first pleads simplicity obedience and example for hi excuse who whatever he shall do it can not be impute to malice ti at the bad but misfortune besides what isocrates say that defect be nearer ally to moderation than excess the other be a much more ruffling gamester for whosoever shall take upon him to choose and alter usurp the authority of judging and should look well about him and make it hi business to discern clearly the defect of what he would abolish and the virtue of what he be about to introduce this so vulgar consideration be that which settle me in my station and keep even my most extravagant and ungoverned youth under the rein so a not to burden my shoulder with so great a weight a to render myself responsible for a science of that importance and in this to dare what in my good and more mature judgment i durst not do in the most easy and indifferent thing i have be instruct in and wherein the temerity of judging be of no consequence at all it seem to me very unjust to go about to subject public and establish custom and institution to the weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy for private reason have but a private jurisdiction and to attempt that upon the divine which no government will endure a man should do upon the civil law with which though human reason have much more commerce than with the other yet be they sovereignly judge by their own proper judge and the extreme sufficiency serve only to expound and set forth the law and custom receive and neither to wrest it nor to introduce anything of innovation if sometimes the divine providence have go beyond the rule to which it have necessarily bind and oblige u men it be not to give u any dispensation to do the same those be masterstroke of the divine hand which we be not to imitate but to admire and extraordinary example mark of express and particular purpose of the nature of miracle present before u for manifestation of it almightiness equally above both our rule and force which it would be folly and impiety to attempt to represent and imitate and that we ought not to follow but to contemplate with the great reverence act of hi personage and not for u cotta very opportunely declare god know in the present quarrel of our civil war where there be a hundred article to dash out and to put in great and very considerable how many there be who can truly boast they have exactly and perfectly weigh and understand the ground and reason of the one and the other party ti a number if they make any number that would be able to give u very little disturbance but what become of all the rest under what ensigns do they march in what quarter do they lie theirs have the same effect with other weak and illapplied medicine they have only set the humour they would purge more violently in work stir and exasperate by the conflict and leave them still behind the potion be too weak to purge but strong enough to weaken u so that it do not work but we keep it still in our body and reap nothing from the operation but intestine gripe and dolour so it be nevertheless that fortune still reserve her authority in defiance of whatever we be able to do or say sometimes present u with a necessity so urgent that ti requisite the law should a little yield and give way and when one oppose the increase of an innovation that thus intrude itself by violence to keep a man self in so do in all place and in all thing within bound and rule against those who have the power and to whom all thing be lawful that may in any way serve to advance their design who have no other law nor rule but what serve best to their own purpose ti a dangerous obligation and an intolerable inequality forasmuch a the ordinary discipline of a healthful state do not provide against these extraordinary accident it presuppose a body that support itself in it principal member and office and a common consent to it obedience and observation a legitimate proceeding be cold heavy and constrained and not fit to make head against a headstrong and unbridled proceeding ti know to be to this day cast in the dish of those two great men octavius and cato in the two civil war of sylla and caesar that they would rather suffer their country to undergo the last extremity than relieve their fellowcitizens at the expense of it law or be guilty of any innovation for in truth in these last necessity where there be no other remedy it would peradventure be more discreetly do to stoop and yield a little to receive the blow than by oppose without possibility of do good to give occasion to violence to trample all under foot and good to make the law do what they can when they can not do what they would after this manner do he who suspend them for fourandtwenty hour and he who for once shift a day in the calendar and that other who of the month of june make a second of may the lacedaemonians themselves who be so religious observer of the law of their country be straiten by one of their own edict by which it be expressly forbidden to choose the same man twice to be admiral and on the other side their affair necessarily require that lysander should again take upon him that command they make one aratus admiral ti true but withal lysander go general of the navy and by the same subtlety one of their ambassador be send to the athenian to obtain the revocation of some decree and pericles remonstrate to him that it be forbidden to take away the tablet wherein a law have once be engross he advise him to turn it only that be not forbid and plutarch commend philopoemen that be bear to command he know how to do it not only accord to the law but also to overrule even the law themselves when the public necessity so required jacques amiot grand almoner of france one day relate to me this story much to the honour of a prince of ours and ours he be upon several very good account though originally of foreign extraction that in the time of our first commotion at the siege of rouen this prince have be advertise by the queenmother of a conspiracy against hi life and in her letter particular notice be give him of the person who be to execute the business who be a gentleman of anjou or of maine and who to this effect ordinarily frequent this prince house discover not a syllable of this intelligence to any one whatever but go the next day to the st catherine mount from which our battery play against the town for it be during the time of the siege and have in company with him the say lord almoner and another bishop he saw this gentleman who have be denote to him and presently send for him to whom be come before him see him already pale and tremble with the conscience of hi guilt he thus say monsieur such an one you guess what i have to say to you your countenance discovers it tis in vain to disguise your practice for i be so well inform of your business that it will but make bad for you to go about to conceal or deny it you know very well such and such passage which be the most secret circumstance of hi conspiracy and therefore be sure a you tender your own life to confess to me the whole truth of the design the poor man see himself thus trap and convict for the whole business have be discover to the queen by one of the accomplice be in such a take he know not what to do but fold hi hand to beg and sue for mercy he throw himself at hi prince foot who take him up proceed to say come sir tell me have i at any time do you offence or have i through private hatred or malice offend any kinsman or friend of yours it be not above three week that i have know you what inducement then could move you to attempt my death to which the gentleman with a trembling voice reply that it be no particular grudge he have to hi person but the general interest and concern of hi party and that he have be put upon it by some who have persuade him it would be a meritorious act by any mean to extirpate so great and so powerful an enemy of their religion well say the prince i will now let you see how much more charitable the religion be that i maintain than that which you profess yours have counsel you to kill me without hear me speak and without ever have give you any cause of offence and mine command me to forgive you convict a you be by your own confession of a design to kill me without reason get you go let me see you no more and if you be wise choose henceforward honester men for your counsellor in your design the emperor augustus be in gaul have certain information of a conspiracy l cinna be contrive against him he therefore resolve to make him an example and to that end send to summon hi friend to meet the next morning in counsel but the night between he pass in great unquiet of mind consider that he be about to put to death a young man of an illustrious family and nephew to the great pompey and this make him break out into several passionate complainings what then say he be it possible that i be to live in perpetual anxiety and alarm and suffer my wouldbe assassin meantime to walk abroad at liberty shall he go unpunished after have conspire against my life a life that i have hitherto defend in so many civil war in so many battle by land and by sea and after have settle the universal peace of the whole world shall this man be pardon who have conspire not only to murder but to sacrifice mefor the conspiracy be to kill him at sacrifice after which remain for some time silent he begin again in louder tone and exclaim against himself say why liv thou if it be for the good of so many that thou shouldst die must there be no end of thy revenge and cruelty be thy life of so great value that so many mischief must be do to preserve it hi wife livia see him in this perplexity will you take a woman counsel say she do a the physician do who when the ordinary recipe will do no good make trial of the contrary by severity you have hitherto prevail nothing lepidus have follow salvidienus murena lepidus caepio murena egnatius caepio begin now and try how sweetness and clemency will succeed cinna be convict forgive him he will never henceforth have the heart to hurt thee and it will be an act to thy glory augustus be well pleased that he have meet with an advocate of hi own humour wherefore have thank hi wife and in the morning countermand hi friend he have before summon to council he command cinna all alone to be bring to him who be accordingly come and a chair by hi appointment set him have order all the rest out of the room he spake to him after this manner in the first place cinna i demand of thee patient audience do not interrupt me in what i be about to say and i will afterwards give thee time and leisure to answer thou knowest cinna that have take thee prisoner in the enemy camp and thou an enemy not only so become but born so i give thee thy life restore to thee all thy good and finally put thee in so good a posture by my bounty of living well and at thy ease that the victorious envy the conquer the sacerdotal office which thou mad suit to me for i confer upon thee after have deny it to other whose father have ever bear arm in my service after so many obligation thou hast undertaken to kill me at which cinna cry out that he be very far from entertain any so wicked a thought thou dost not keep thy promise cinna continue augustus that thou wouldst not interrupt me yes thou hast undertaken to murder me in such a place on such a day in such and such company and in such a manner at which word see cinna astound and silent not upon the account of hi promise so to be but interdict with the weight of hi conscience why proceed augustus to what end wouldst thou do it be it to be emperor believe me the republic be in very ill condition if i be the only man betwixt thee and the empire thou art not able so much a to defend thy own house and but tother day be baffle in a suit by the opposed interest of a mere manumit slave what hast thou neither mean nor power in any other thing but only to undertake caesar i quit the throne if there be no other than i to obstruct thy hope canst thou believe that paulus that fabius that the cossii and the servilii and so many noble roman not only so in title but who by their virtue honour their nobility would suffer or endure thee after this and a great deal more that he say to him for he be two long hour in speaking now go cinna go thy way i give thee that life a traitor and parricide which i before give thee in the quality of an enemy let friendship from this time forward begin betwixt u and let u show whether i have give or thou hast receive thy life with the good faith and so depart from him some time after he prefer him to the consular dignity complaining that he have not the confidence to demand it have him ever after for hi very great friend and be at last make by him sole heir to all hi estate now from the time of this accident which befall augustus in the fortieth year of hi age he never have any conspiracy or attempt against him and so reap the due reward of this hi so generous clemency but it do not so happen with our prince hi moderation and mercy not so secure him but that he afterwards fell into the toil of the like treason so vain and futile a thing be human prudence throughout all our project counsel and precaution fortune will still be mistress of event we repute physician fortunate when they hit upon a lucky cure a if there be no other art but theirs that could not stand upon it own leg and whose foundation be too weak to support itself upon it own basis a if no other art stand in need of fortune hand to help it for my part i think of physic a much good or ill a any one would have me for thanks be to god we have no traffic together i be of a quite contrary humour to other men for i always despise it but when i be sick instead of recant or enter into composition with it i begin moreover to hate and fear it tell them who importune me to take physic that at all event they must give me time to recover my strength and health that i may be the good able to support and encounter the violence and danger of their potion i let nature work suppose her to be sufficiently arm with teeth and claw to defend herself from the assault of infirmity and to uphold that contexture the dissolution of which she fly and abhors i be afraid l instead of assist her when close grapple and struggle with disease i should assist her adversary and burden her still more with work to do now i say that not in physic only but in other more certain art fortune have a very great part the poetic raptures the flight of fancy that ravish and transport the author out of himself why should we not attribute them to hi good fortune since he himself confess that they exceed hi sufficiency and force and acknowledge them to proceed from something els than himself and that he have them no more in hi power than the orator say they have those extraordinary motion and agitation that sometimes push them beyond their design it be the same in paint where touch shall sometimes slip from the hand of the painter so surpass both hi conception and hi art a to beget hi own admiration and astonishment but fortune do yet more evidently manifest the share she have in all thing of this kind by the grace and elegance we find in them not only beyond the intention but even without the knowledge of the workman a competent reader often discovers in other men writing other perfection than the author himself either intend or perceive a rich sense and more quaint expression a to military enterprise every one see how great a hand fortune have in them even in our counsel and deliberation there must certainly be something of chance and goodluck mixed with human prudence for all that our wisdom can do alone be no great matter the more piercing quick and apprehensive it be the weak it find itself and be by so much more apt to mistrust itself i be of syllas opinion and when i closely examine the most glorious exploit of war i perceive methinks that those who carry them on make use of counsel and debate only for custom sake and leave the best part of the enterprise to fortune and rely upon her aid transgress at every turn the bound of military conduct and the rule of war there happen sometimes fortuitous alacrity and strange fury in their deliberation that for the most part prompt them to follow the bad grounded counsel and swell their courage beyond the limit of reason whence it happen that several of the great captain of old to justify those rash resolution have be fain to tell their soldier that they be invite to such attempt by some inspiration some sign and prognostic wherefore in this doubt and uncertainty that the shortsightedness of human wisdom to see and choose the best by reason of the difficulty that the various accident and circumstance of thing bring along with them perplex u withal the sure way in my opinion do no other consideration invite u to it be to pitch upon that wherein be the great appearance of honesty and justice and not be certain of the short to keep the straight and most direct way a in the two example i have just give there be no question but it be more noble and generous in him who have receive the offence to pardon it than to do otherwise if the former miscarry in it he be not nevertheless to be blame for hi good intention neither do any one know if he have proceed otherwise whether by that mean he have avoid the end hi destiny have appoint for him and he have moreover lose the glory of so humane an act you will read in history of many who have be in such apprehension that the most part have take the course to meet and anticipate conspiracy against them by punishment and revenge but i find very few who have reap any advantage by this proceeding witness so many roman emperor whoever find himself in this danger ought not to expect much either from hi vigilance or power for how hard a thing be it for a man to secure himself from an enemy who lie conceal under the countenance of the most assiduous friend we have and to discover and know the will and inward thought of those who be in our personal service ti to much purpose to have a guard of foreigner about one and to be always fence about with a pale of arm men whosoever despise hi own life be always master of that of another man and moreover this continual suspicion that make a prince jealous of all the world must of necessity be a strange torment to him therefore it be that dion be advertise that callippus watch all opportunity to take away hi life have never the heart to inquire more particularly into it say that he have rather die than live in that misery that he must continually stand upon hi guard not only against hi enemy but hi friend also which alexander much more vividly and more roundly manifest in effect when have notice by a letter from parmenio that philip hi most beloved physician be by darius money corrupt to poison him at the same time he give the letter to philip to read drink off the potion he have bring him be not this to express a resolution that if hi friend have a mind to despatch him out of the world he be willing to give them opportunity to do it this prince be indeed the sovereign pattern of hazardous action but i do not know whether there be another passage in hi life wherein there be so much firm courage a in this nor so illustrious an image of the beauty and greatness of hi mind those who preach to prince so circumspect and vigilant a jealousy and distrust under colour of security preach to them ruin and dishonour nothing noble can be perform without danger i know a person naturally of a very great daring and enterprising courage whose good fortune be continually mar by such persuasion that he keep himself close surround by hi friend that he must not hearken to any reconciliation with hi ancient enemy that he must stand aloof and not trust hi person in hand strong than hi own what promise or offer soever they may make him or what advantage soever he may see before him and i know another who have unexpectedly advance hi fortune by follow a clear contrary advice courage the reputation and glory of which men seek with so greedy an appetite present itself when need require a magnificently in cuerpo a in full armour in a closet a in a camp with arm pendant a with arm raise this overcircumspect and wary prudence be a mortal enemy to all high and generous exploit scipio to sound syphaxs intention leave hi army abandon spain not yet secure nor well settle in hi new conquest could pass over into africa in two small ship to commit himself in an enemys country to the power of a barbarian king to a faith untried and unknown without obligation without hostage under the sole security of the grandeur of hi own courage hi good fortune and the promise of hi high hope in a life of ambition and glory it be necessary to hold a stiff rein upon suspicion fear and distrust invite and draw on offence the most mistrustful of our king establish hi affair principally by voluntarily commit hi life and liberty into hi enemy hand by that action manifest that he have absolute confidence in them to the end they might repose a great an assurance in him caesar only oppose the authority of hi countenance and the haughty sharpness of hi rebuke to hi mutinous legion in arm against him but it be true withal that this undaunted assurance be not to be represent in it simple and entire form but by such whom the apprehension of death and the bad that can happen do not terrify and affright for to represent a pretended resolution with a pale and doubtful countenance and tremble limb for the service of an important reconciliation will effect nothing to purpose ti an excellent way to gain the heart and will of another to submit and intrust one self to him provide it appear to be freely do and without the constraint of necessity and in such a condition that a man manifestly do it out of a pure and entire confidence in the party at least with a countenance clear from any cloud of suspicion i saw when i be a boy a gentleman who be governor of a great city upon occasion of a popular commotion and fury not know what other course to take go out of a place of very great strength and security and commit himself to the mercy of the seditious rabble in hope by that mean to appease the tumult before it grow to a more formidable head but it be ill for him that he do so for he be there miserably slay but i be not nevertheless of opinion that he commit so great an error in go out a men commonly reproach hi memory withal a he do in choose a gentle and submissive way for the effect hi purpose and in endeavour to quiet this storm rather by obey than command and by entreaty rather than remonstrance and i be inclined to believe that a gracious severity with a soldierlike way of command full of security and confidence suitable to the quality of hi person and the dignity of hi command would have succeed well with him at least he have perish with great decency and reputation there be nothing so little to be expect or hop for from this manyheaded monster in it fury a humanity and good nature it be much more capable of reverence and fear i should also reproach him that have take a resolution in my judgment rather brave than rash to expose himself weak and naked in this tempestuous sea of enraged madman he ought to have stick to hi text and not for an instant to have abandon the high part he have undertake whereas come to discover hi danger nearer hand and hi nose happen to bleed he again change that demiss and fawn countenance he have at first put on into another of fear and amazement fill hi voice with entreaty and hi eye with tear and endeavour so to withdraw and secure hi person that carriage more inflamed their fury and soon bring the effect of it upon him it be upon a time intend that there should be a general muster of several troop in arm and that be the most proper occasion of secret revenge and there be no place where they can be execute with great safety and there be public and manifest appearance that there be no safe come for some whose principal and necessary office it be to review them whereupon a consultation be hold and several counsel be propose a in a case that be very nice and of great difficulty and moreover of grave consequence mine amongst the rest be that they should by all mean avoid give any sign of suspicion but that the officer who be most in danger should boldly go and with cheerful and erect countenance ride boldly and confidently through the rank and that instead of spar fire which the counsel of the major part tend to they should entreat the captain to command the soldier to give round and full volley in honour of the spectator and not to spare their powder this be accordingly do and serve so good use a to please and gratify the suspected troop and thenceforward to beget a mutual and wholesome confidence and intelligence amongst them i look upon julius caesar way of win men to him a the best and fine that can be put in practice first he try by clemency to make himself beloved even by hi very enemies content himself in detect conspiracy only publicly to declare that he be preacquainted with them which be do he take a noble resolution to await without solicitude or fear whatever might be the event wholly resign himself to the protection of the god and fortune for questionless in this state he be at the time when he be kill a stranger have publicly say that he could teach dionysius the tyrant of syracuse an infallible way to find out and discover all the conspiracy hi subject could contrive against him if he would give him a good sum of money for hi pain dionysius hearing of it cause the man to be bring to him that he might learn an art so necessary to hi preservation the man make answer that all the art he know be that he should give him a talent and afterwards boast that he have obtain a singular secret from him dionysius like the invention and accordingly cause six hundred crown to be count out to him it be not likely he should give so great a sum to a person unknown but upon the account of some extraordinary discovery and the belief of this serve to keep hi enemy in awe prince however do wisely to publish the information they receive of all the practice against their life to possess men with an opinion they have so good intelligence that nothing can be plot against them but they have present notice of it the duke of athens do a great many foolish thing in the establishment of hi new tyranny over florence but this especially be most notable that have receive the first intimation of the conspiracy the people be hatch against him from matteo di morozzo one of the conspirator he presently put him to death to suppress that rumour that it might not be think any of the city dislike hi government i remember i have formerly read a story of some roman of great quality who fly the tyranny of the triumvirate have a thousand time by the subtlety of a many invention escape from fall into the hand of those that pursue him it happen one day that a troop of horse which be send out to take him pass close by a brake where he be squat and missed very narrowly of spy him but he consider at this point the pain and difficulty wherein he have so long continued to evade the strict and incessant search that be every day make for him the little pleasure he could hope for in such a kind of life and how much good it be for him to die once for all than to be perpetually at this pas he start from hi seat call them back show them hi form and voluntarily deliver himself up to their cruelty by that mean to free both himself and them from far trouble to invite a man enemy to come and cut hi throat seem a resolution a little extravagant and odd and yet i think he do good to take that course than to live in continual feverish fear of an accident for which there be no cure but see all the remedy a man can apply to such a disease be full of unquiet and uncertainty ti well with a manly courage to prepare one self for the bad that can happen and to extract some consolation from this that we be not certain the thing we fear will ever come to pass i be often when a boy wonderfully concern to see in the italian farce a pedant always bring in for the fool of the play and that the title of magister be in no great reverence amongst u for be deliver up to their tuition what could i do less than be jealous of their honour and reputation i seek indeed to excuse them by the natural incompatibility betwixt the vulgar sort and men of a finer thread both in judgment and knowledge forasmuch a they go a quite contrary way to one another but in this the thing i most stumble at be that the fine gentleman be those who most despise them witness our famous poet du bellay and twas so in former time for plutarch say that greek and scholar be term of reproach and contempt amongst the roman but since with the good experience of age i find they have very great reason so to do and that but whence it should come to pass that a mind enrich with the knowledge of so many thing should not become more quick and sprightly and that a gross and vulgar understanding should lodge within it without correct and improve itself all the discourse and judgment of the great mind the world ever have i be yet to seek to admit so many foreign conception so great and so high fancy it be necessary a a young lady one of the great princess of the kingdom say to me once speak of a certain person that a man own brain must be crowd and squeeze together into a less compass to make room for the other i should be apt to conclude that a plant be suffocate and drown with too much nourishment and lamp with too much oil so with too much study and matter be the active part of the understanding which be embarrass and confound with a great diversity of thing lose the force and power to disengage itself and by the pressure of this weight be bow subjected and double up but it be quite otherwise for our soul stretch and dilate itself proportion a it fill and in the example of elder time we see quite contrary men very proper for public business great captain and great statesman very learn withal and a to the philosopher a sort of men remote from all public affair they have be sometimes also despise by the comic liberty of their time their opinion and manner make them appear to men of another sort ridiculous would you make them judge of a lawsuit of the action of men they be ready to take it upon them and straight begin to examine if there be life if there be motion if man be any other than an ox what it be to do and to suffer what animal law and justice be do they speak of the magistrate or to him tis with a rude irreverent and indecent liberty do they hear their prince or a king commend they make no more of him than of a shepherd goatherd or neatherd a lazy coridon occupy in milking and shear hi herd and flock but more rudely and harshly than the herd or shepherd himself do you repute any man the great for be lord of two thousand acre of land they laugh at such a pitiful pittance a laying claim themselves to the whole world for their possession do you boast of your nobility a be descend from seven rich successive ancestor they look upon you with an eye of contempt a men who have not a right idea of the universal image of nature and that do not consider how many predecessor every one of u have have rich poor king slave greek and barbarian and though you be the fiftieth descendant from hercules they look upon it a a great vanity so highly to value this which be only a gift of fortune and twas so the vulgar sort contemn them a men ignorant of the most elementary and ordinary thing a presumptuous and insolent but this platonic picture be far different from that these pedant be present by those be envy for raise themselves above the common sort for despise the ordinary action and office of life for have assume a particular and inimitable way of living and for use a certain method of highflight and obsolete language quite different from the ordinary way of speaking but these be contemn a be a much below the usual form a incapable of public employment a lead a life and conform themselves to the mean and vile manner of the vulgar for what concern the philosopher a i have say if they be in science they be yet much great in action and a it be say of the geometrician of syracuse who have be disturb from hi contemplation to put some of hi skill in practice for the defence of hi country that he suddenly set on foot dreadful and prodigious engine that work effect beyond all human expectation himself notwithstanding disdain all hi handiwork and thinking in this he have play the mere mechanic and violate the dignity of hi art of which these performance of hi he account but trivial experiment and plaything so they whenever they have be put upon the proof of action have be see to fly to so high a pitch a make it very well appear their soul be marvellously elevate and enrich by the knowledge of thing but some of them see the rein of government in the hand of incapable men have avoid all management of political affair and he who demand of crate how long it be necessary to philosophise receive this answer till our army be no more command by fool heraclitus resign the royalty to hi brother and to the ephesian who reproach him that he spend hi time in play with child before the temple be it not well say he to do so than to sit at the helm of affair in your company other have their imagination advance above the world and fortune have look upon the tribunal of justice and even the throne of king a paltry and contemptible insomuch that empedocles refuse the royalty that the agrigentines offer to him thales once inveigh in discourse against the pain and care men put themselves to to become rich be answer by one in the company that he do like the fox who find fault with what he could not obtain whereupon he have a mind for the jest sake to show them to the contrary and have for this occasion make a muster of all hi wit wholly to employ them in the service of profit and gain he set a traffic on foot which in one year bring him in so great rich that the most experienced in that trade could hardly in their whole life with all their industry have rake so much together that which aristotle report of some who call both him and anaxagoras and other of their profession wise but not prudent in not apply their study to more profitable thingsthough i do not well digest this verbal distinctionthat will not however serve to excuse my pedant for to see the low and necessitous fortune wherewith they be content we have rather reason to pronounce that they be neither wise nor prudent but let this first reason alone i think it good to say that this evil proceeds from their apply themselves the wrong way to the study of the science and that after the manner we be instruct it be no wonder if neither the scholar nor the master become though more learned ever the wiser or more able in plain truth the care and expense our parent be at in our education point at nothing but to furnish our head with knowledge but not a word of judgment and virtue cry out of one that pass by to the people o what a learned man and of another o what a good man they will not fail to turn their eye and address their respect to the former there should then be a third crier o the blockhead men be apt presently to inquire do such a one understand greek or latin be he a poet or do he write in prose but whether he be grow well or more discreet which be quality of principal concern these be never think of we should rather examine who be well learn than who be more learned we only labour to stuff the memory and leave the conscience and the understanding unfurnished and void like bird who fly abroad to forage for grain and bring it home in the beak without taste it themselves to fee their young so our pedant go pick knowledge here and there out of book and hold it at the tongue end only to spit it out and distribute it abroad and here i can not but smile to think how i have pay myself in show the foppery of this kind of learning who myself be so manifest an example for do i not the same thing throughout almost this whole composition i go here and there cull out of several book the sentence that best please me not to keep them for i have no memory to retain them in but to transplant them into this where to say the truth they be no more mine than in their first place we be i conceive know only in present knowledge and not at all in what be past or more than be that which be to come but the bad ont be their scholar and pupil be no good nourish by this kind of inspiration and it make no deep impression upon them but pass from hand to hand only to make a show to be tolerable company and to tell pretty story like a counterfeit coin in counter of no other use or value but to reckon with or to set up at card nature to shew that there be nothing barbarous where she have the sole conduct oftentimes in nation where art have the least to do cause production of wit such a may rival the great effect of art whatever in relation to what i be now speak of the gascon proverb derive from a cornpipe be very quaint and subtle we can say cicero say thus these be the manner of plato these be the very word of aristotle but what do we say ourselves what do we judge a parrot would say as much a that and this put me in mind of that rich gentleman of rome who have be solicitous with very great expense to procure men that be excellent in all sort of science whom he have always attend hi person to the end that when amongst hi friend any occasion fell out of speaking of any subject whatsoever they might supply hi place and be ready to prompt him one with a sentence of seneca another with a verse of homer and so forth every one accord to hi talent and he fancy this knowledge to be hi own because it be in the head of those who live upon hi bounty a they also do whose learn consist in have noble library i know one who when i question him what he know he presently call for a book to shew me and dare not venture to tell me so much a that he have pile in hi posterior till first he have consult hi dictionary what pile and what posterior be we take other men knowledge and opinion upon trust which be an idle and superficial learning we must make it our own we be in this very like him who have need of fire go to a neighbour house to fetch it and find a very good one there sit down to warm himself without remember to carry any with him home what good do it do u to have the stomach full of meat if it do not digest if it be not incorporate with u if it do not nourish and support u can we imagine that lucullus whom letter without any manner of experience make so great a captain learn to be so after this perfunctory manner we suffer ourselves to lean and rely so strongly upon the arm of another that we destroy our own strength and vigour would i fortify myself against the fear of death it must be at the expense of seneca would i extract consolation for myself or my friend i borrow it from cicero i might have find it in myself have i be train to make use of my own reason i do not like this relative and mendicant understanding for though we could become learn by other men learn a man can never be wise but by hi own wisdom dionysius laugh at the grammarian who set themselves to inquire into the misery of ulysses and be ignorant of their own at musician who be so exact in tune their instrument and never tune their manner at orator who make it a study to declare what be justice but never take care to do it if the mind be not well dispose if the judgment be no good settle i have much rather my scholar have spend hi time at tennis for at least hi body would by that mean be in good exercise and breath do but observe him when he come back from school after fifteen or sixteen year that he have be there there be nothing so unfit for employment all you shall find he have get be that hi latin and greek have only make him a great coxcomb than when he go from home he should bring back hi soul replete with good literature and he bring it only swell and puff up with vain and empty shred and patch of learning and have really nothing more in him than he have before these pedant of ours a plato say of the sophist their cousingermans be of all men they who most pretend to be useful to mankind and who alone of all men not only do not well and improve that which be commit to them a a carpenter or a mason would do but make them much bad and make u pay them for make them bad to boot if the rule which protagoras propose to hi pupil be follow either that they should give him hi own demand or make affidavit upon oath in the temple how much they value the profit they have receive under hi tuition and satisfy him accordinglymy pedagogue would find themselves sorely gravel if they be to be judge by the affidavit of my experience my perigordin patois very pleasantly call these pretender to learn lettreferits a a man should say lettermarkedmen on whom letter have be stamp by the blow of a mallet and in truth for the most part they appear to be deprive even of common sense for you see the husbandman and the cobbler go simply and fairly about their business speak only of what they know and understand whereas these fellow to make parade and to get opinion muster this ridiculous knowledge of theirs that float on the superficies of the brain be perpetually perplexing and entangle themselves in their own nonsense they speak fine word sometimes tis true but let somebody that be wise apply them they be wonderfully well acquaint with galen but not at all with the disease of the patient they have already deafen you with a long ribblerow of law but understand nothing of the case in hand they have the theory of all thing let who will put it in practice i have sit by when a friend of mine in my own house for sportsake have with one of these fellow counterfeit a jargon of galimatias patch up of phrase without head or tail saving that he interlard here and there some term that have relation to their dispute and hold the coxcomb in play a whole afternoon together who all the while think he have answer pertinently and learnedly to all hi objection and yet this be a man of letter and reputation and a fine gentleman of the long robe whosoever shall narrowly pry into and thoroughly sift this sort of people wherewith the world be so pestered will a i have do find that for the most part they neither understand other nor themselves and that their memory be full enough but the judgment totally void and empty some except whose own nature have of itself form them into good fashion a i have observe for example in adrian turnebus who have never make other profession than that of mere learn only and in that in my opinion he be the great man that have be these thousand year have nothing at all in him of the pedant but the wearing of hi gown and a little exterior fashion that could not be civilise to courtier way which in themselves be nothing i hate our people who can worse endure an illcontrived robe than an illcontrived mind and take their measure by the leg a man make by hi behaviour and so much a the very fashion of hi boot what kind of man he be for within there be not a more polished soul upon earth i have often purposely put him upon argument quite wide of hi profession wherein i find he have so clear an insight so quick an apprehension so solid a judgment that a man would have think he have never practise any other thing but arm and be all hi life employ in affair of state these be great and vigorous nature that can keep themselves upright in despite of a pedantic education but it be not enough that our education do not spoil u it must moreover alter u for the good some of our parliament when they be to admit officer examine only their learning to which some of the other also add the trial of understanding by ask their judgment of some case in law of these the latter methinks proceed with the good method for although both be necessary and that it be very requisite they should be defective in neither yet in truth knowledge be not so absolutely necessary a judgment the last may make shift without the other but the other never without this for a the greek verse say would to god that for the good of our judicature these society be as well furnish with understanding and conscience a they be with knowledge we be not to tie learn to the soul but to work and incorporate them together not to tincture it only but to give it a thorough and perfect dye which if it will not take colour and meliorate it imperfect state it be without question well to let it alone tis a dangerous weapon that will hinder and wind it master if put into an awkward and unskilful hand and this peradventure be the reason why neither we nor theology require much learning in woman and that francis duke of brittany son of john v one talk with him about hi marriage with isabella the daughter of scotland and add that she be homely breed and without any manner of learn make answer that he like her the good and that a woman be wise enough if she could distinguish her husband shirt from hi doublet so that it be no so great wonder a they make of it that our ancestor have letter in no great esteem and that even to this day they be but rarely meet with in the principal council of prince and if the end and design of acquire rich which be the only thing we propose to ourselves by the mean of law physic pedantry and even divinity itself do not uphold and keep them in credit you would with doubt see them in as pitiful a condition a ever and what loss would this be if they neither instruct u to think well nor to do well all other knowledge be hurtful to him who have not the science of goodness but the reason i glance upon but now may it not also hence proceed that our study in france have almost no other aim but profit except a to those who by nature bear to office and employment rather of glory than gain addict themselves to letter if at all only for so short a time be take from their study before they can come to have any taste of them to a profession that have nothing to do with book there ordinarily remain no other to apply themselves wholly to learn but people of mean condition who in that only seek the mean to live and by such people whose soul be both by nature and by domestic education and example of the base alloy the fruit of knowledge be immaturely gather and ill digest and deliver to their recipient quite another thing for it be not for knowledge to enlighten a soul that be dark of itself nor to make a blind man see her business be not to find a mans eye but to guide govern and direct them provide he have sound foot and straight leg to go upon knowledge be an excellent drug but no drug have virtue enough to preserve itself from corruption and decay if the vessel be taint and impure wherein it be put to keep such a one may have a sight clear enough who look asquint and consequently see what be good but do not follow it and see knowledge but make no use of it plato principal institution in hi republic be to fit hi citizen with employment suitable to their nature nature can do all and do all cripple be very unfit for exercise of the body and lame soul for exercise of the mind degenerate and vulgar soul be unworthy of philosophy if we see a shoemaker with hi shoe out at the toe we say tis no wonder for commonly none go bad shod than they in like manner experience often present u a physician worse physicked a divine less reform and constantly a scholar of less sufficiency than other people old aristo of chios have reason to say that philosopher do their auditor harm forasmuch a most of the soul of those that hear them be not capable of derive benefit from instruction which if not apply to good would certainly be apply to ill in that excellent institution that xenophon attribute to the persian we find that they teach their child virtue a other nation do letter plato tell u that the eldest son in their royal succession be thus bring up after hi birth he be deliver not to woman but to eunuchs of the great authority about their king for their virtue whose charge it be to keep hi body healthful and in good plight and after he come to seven year of age to teach him to ride and to go ahunting when he arrive at fourteen he be transfer into the hand of four the wise the most just the most temperate and most valiant of the nation of whom the first be to instruct him in religion the second to be always upright and sincere the third to conquer hi appetite and desire and the fourth to despise all danger it be a thing worthy of very great consideration that in that excellent and in truth for it perfection prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus though so solicitous of the education of child a a thing of the great concern and even in the very seat of the mus he should make so little mention of learning a if that generous youth disdain all other subjection but that of virtue ought to be supply instead of tutor to read to them art and science with such master a should only instruct them in valour prudence and justice an example that plato have follow in hi law the manner of their discipline be to propound to them question in judgment upon men and their action and if they commend or condemn this or that person or fact they be to give a reason for so do by which mean they at once sharpen their understanding and learn what be right astyages in xenophon ask cyrus to give an account of hi last lesson and thus it be a great boy in our school have a little short cassock by force take a longer from another that be not so tall a he and give him hi own in exchange whereupon i be appoint judge of the controversy give judgment that i think it best each should keep the coat he have for that they both of them be well fit with that of one another than with their own upon which my master tell me i have do ill in that i have only consider the fitness of the garment whereas i ought to have consider the justice of the thing which require that no one should have anything forcibly take from him that be hi own and cyrus add that he be whip for hi pain a we be in our village for forget the first aorist of my pedant must make me a very learned oration in genere demonstrativo before he can persuade me that hi school be like unto that they know how to go the ready way to work and see that science when most rightly apply and best understood can do no more but teach u prudence moral honesty and resolution they think fit at first hand to initiate their child with the knowledge of effect and to instruct them not by hearsay and rote but by the experiment of action in lively form and mould them not only by word and precept but chiefly by work and example to the end it might not be a knowledge in the mind only but it complexion and habit not an acquisition but a natural possession one ask to this purpose agesilaus what he think most proper for boy to learn what they ought to do when they come to be men say he it be no wonder if such an institution produce so admirable effect they use to go it be say to the other city of greece to inquire out rhetorician painter and musician but to lacedaemon for legislator magistrate and general of army at athens they learn to speak well here to do well there to disengage themselves from a sophistical argument and to unravel the imposture of captious syllogism here to evade the bait and allurement of pleasure and with a noble courage and resolution to conquer the menace of fortune and death those cudgel their brain about word these make it their business to inquire into thing there be an eternal babble of the tongue here a continual exercise of the soul and therefore it be nothing strange if when antipater demand of them fifty child for hostage they make answer quite contrary to what we should do that they would rather give him twice a many fullgrown men so much do they value the loss of their country education when agesilaus court xenophon to send hi child to sparta to be breed it be not say he there to learn logic or rhetoric but to be instruct in the noble of all science namely the science to obey and to command it be very pleasant to see socrates after hi manner rally hippias who recount to him what a world of money he have get especially in certain little village of sicily by teach school and that he make never a penny at sparta what a sottish and stupid people say socrates be they without sense or understanding that make no account either of grammar or poetry and only busy themselves in study the genealogy and succession of their king the foundation rise and declension of state and such tale of a tub after which have make hippias from one step to another acknowledge the excellency of their form of public administration and the felicity and virtue of their private life he leave him to guess at the conclusion he make of the inutility of hi pedantic art example have demonstrate to u that in military affair and all other of the like active nature the study of science more softens and untempers the courage of men than it in any way fortifies and excite them the most potent empire that at this day appear to be in the whole world be that of the turk a people equally inure to the estimation of arm and the contempt of letter i find rome be more valiant before she grow so learn the most warlike nation at this time in be be the most rude and ignorant the scythian the parthian tamerlane serve for sufficient proof of this when the goth overran greece the only thing that preserve all the library from the fire be that some one possess them with an opinion that they be to leave this kind of furniture entire to the enemy a be most proper to divert them from the exercise of arm and to fix them to a lazy and sedentary life when our king charles viii almost without strike a blow saw himself possess of the kingdom of naples and a considerable part of tuscany the noble about him attribute this unexpected facility of conquest to this that the prince and noble of italy more studied to render themselves ingenious and learn than vigorous and warlike i never yet saw that father but let hi son be never so decrepit or deform would not notwithstanding own him not nevertheless if he be not totally besotted and blind with hi paternal affection that he do not well enough discern hi defect but that with all default he be still hi just so i see well than any other that all i write here be but the idle revery of a man that have only nibble upon the outward crust of science in hi nonage and only retain a general and formless image of them who have get a little snatch of everything and nothing of the whole a la francoise for i know in general that there be such a thing as physic a jurisprudence four part in mathematics and roughly what all these aim and point at and peradventure i yet know farther what sciences in general pretend unto in order to the service of our life but to dive farther than that and to have cudgel my brain in the study of aristotle the monarch of all modern learning or particularly addict myself to any one science i have never do it neither be there any one art of which i be able to draw the first lineament and dead colour insomuch that there be not a boy of the low form in a school that may not pretend to be wise than i who be not able to examine him in hi first lesson which if i be at any time force upon i be necessitate in my own defence to ask him unaptly enough some universal question such a may serve to try hi natural understand a lesson a strange and unknown to him a hi be to me i never seriously settle myself to the reading any book of solid learning but plutarch and seneca and there like the danaid i eternally fill and it as constantly run out something of which drop upon this paper but little or nothing stay with me history be my particular game a to matter of read or els poetry for which i have particular kindness and esteem for a cleanthes say a the voice force through the narrow passage of a trumpet come out more forcible and shrill so methinks a sentence press within the harmony of verse dart out more briskly upon the understanding and strike my ear and apprehension with a smarter and more pleasing effect a to the natural part i have of which this be the essay i find them to bow under the burden my fancy and judgment do but grope in the dark tripping and stumbling in the way and when i have go as far a i can i be in no degree satisfy i discover still a new and great extent of land before me with a troubled and imperfect sight and wrap up in cloud that i be not able to penetrate and take upon me to write indifferently of whatever come into my head and therein making use of nothing but my own proper and natural mean if it befall me a ofttimes it do accidentally to meet in any good author the same head and commonplace upon which i have attempt to write a i do but just now in plutarch discourse of the force of imagination to see myself so weak and so forlorn so heavy and so flat in comparison of those good writer i at once pity or despise myself yet do i please myself with this that my opinion have often the honour and good fortune to jump with theirs and that i go in the same path though at a very great distance and can say ah that be so i be far satisfied to find that i have a quality which every one be not bless withal which be to discern the vast difference between them and me and notwithstanding all that suffer my own invention low and feeble a they be to run on in their career without mend or plaster up the defect that this comparison have lay open to my own view and in plain truth a man have need of a good strong back to keep pace with these people the indiscreet scribbler of our time who amongst their laborious nothing insert whole section and page out of ancient author with a design by that mean to illustrate their own writing do quite contrary for this infinite dissimilitude of ornament render the complexion of their own composition so sallow and deform that they lose much more than they get the philosopher chrysippus and epicurus be in this of two quite contrary humour the first not only in hi book mixed passage and saying of other author but entire piece and in one the whole medea of euripides which give apollodorus occasion to say that should a man pick out of hi writing all that be none of hi he would leave him nothing but blank paper whereas the latter quite on the contrary in three hundred volume that he leave behind him have not so much a one quotation i happen the other day upon this piece of fortune i be read a french book where after i have a long time run dream over a great many word so dull so insipid so void of all wit or common sense that indeed they be only french word after a long and tedious travel i come at last to meet with a piece that be lofty rich and elevate to the very cloud of which have i find either the declivity easy or the ascent gradual there have be some excuse but it be so perpendicular a precipice and so wholly cut off from the rest of the work that by the first six word i find myself fly into the other world and thence discover the vale whence i come so deep and low that i have never have since the heart to descend into it any more if i should set out one of my discourse with such rich spoil a these it would but too evidently manifest the imperfection of my own writing to reprehend the fault in other that i be guilty of myself appear to me no more unreasonable than to condemn a i often do those of other in myself they be to be everywhere reprove and ought to have no sanctuary allow them i know very well how audaciously i myself at every turn attempt to equal myself to my theft and to make my style go hand in hand with them not without a temerarious hope of deceive the eye of my reader from discern the difference but withal it be as much by the benefit of my application that i hope to do it a by that of my invention or any force of my own besides i do not offer to contend with the whole body of these champion nor hand to hand with anyone of them ti only by flight and little light attempt that i engage them i do not grapple with them but try their strength only and never engage so far a i make a show to do if i could hold them in play i be a brave fellow for i never attack them but where they be most sinewy and strong to cover a man self a i have see some do with another man armour so a not to discover so much a hi finger end to carry on a design a it be not hard for a man that have anything of a scholar in him in an ordinary subject to do under old invention patch up here and there with hi own trumpery and then to endeavour to conceal the theft and to make it pass for hi own be first injustice and meanness of spirit in those who do it who have nothing in them of their own fit to procure them a reputation endeavour to do it by attempt to impose thing upon the world in their own name which they have no manner of title to and next a ridiculous folly to content themselves with acquire the ignorant approbation of the vulgar by such a pitiful cheat at the price at the same time of degrade themselves in the eye of men of understand who turn up their nose at all this borrow incrustation yet whose praise alone be worth the have for my own part there be nothing i would not sooner do than that neither have i say so much of other but to get a good opportunity to explain myself nor in this do i glance at the composer of centos who declare themselves for such of which sort of writer i have in my time know many very ingenious and particularly one under the name of capilupus besides the ancient these be really men of wit and that make it appear they be so both by that and other way of writing a for example lipsius in that learn and laborious contexture of hi politics but be it how it will and how inconsiderable soever these ineptitude may be i will say i never intend to conceal them no more than my old bald grizzle likeness before them where the painter have present you not with a perfect face but with mine for these be my own particular opinion and fancy and i deliver them a only what i myself believe and not for what be to be believe by other i have no other end in this writing but only to discover myself who also shall peradventure be another thing tomorrow if i chance to meet any new instruction to change me i have no authority to be believe neither do i desire it be too conscious of my own inerudition to be able to instruct other some one then have see the precede chapter the other day tell me at my house that i should a little farther have extend my discourse on the education of child now madam if i have any sufficiency in this subject i could not possibly well employ it than to present my best instruction to the little man that threaten you shortly with a happy birth for you be too generous to begin otherwise than with a male for have have so great a hand in the treaty of your marriage i have a certain particular right and interest in the greatness and prosperity of the issue that shall spring from it beside that your have have the best of my service so long in possession sufficiently oblige me to desire the honour and advantage of all wherein you shall be concern but in truth all i understand a to that particular be only this that the great and most important difficulty of human science be the education of child for a in agriculture the husbandry that be to precede planting a also plant itself be certain plain and well know but after that which be plant come to life there be a great deal more to be do more art to be use more care to be take and much more difficulty to cultivate and bring it to perfection so it be with men it be no hard matter to get child but after they be bear then begin the trouble solicitude and care rightly to train principle and bring them up the symptom of their inclination in that tender age be so obscure and the promise so uncertain and fallacious that it be very hard to establish any solid judgment or conjecture upon them look at cimon for example and themistocles and a thousand other who very much deceive the expectation men have of them cub of bear and puppy readily discover their natural inclination but men so soon a ever they be grownup apply themselves to certain habit engage themselves in certain opinion and conform themselves to particular law and custom easily alter or at least disguise their true and real disposition and yet it be hard to force the propension of nature whence it come to pass that for not have choose the right course we often take very great pain and consume a good part of our time in train up child to thing for which by their natural constitution they be totally unfit in this difficulty nevertheless i be clearly of opinion that they ought to be element in the best and most advantageous study without take too much notice of or be too superstitious in those light prognostic they give of themselves in their tender year and to which plato in hi republic give methinks too much authority madam science be a very great ornament and a thing of marvellous use especially in person raise to that degree of fortune in which you be and in truth in person of mean and low condition it can not perform it true and genuine office be naturally more prompt to assist in the conduct of war in the government of people in negotiate the league and friendship of prince and foreign nation than in form a syllogism in logic in plead a process in law or in prescribe a dose of pill in physic wherefore madam believe you will not omit this so necessary feature in the education of your child who yourself have taste it sweetness and be of a learned extraction for we yet have the writing of the ancient count of foix from whom my lord your husband and yourself be both of you descend and monsieur de candale your uncle every day oblige the world with other which will extend the knowledge of this quality in your family for so many succeed age i will upon this occasion presume to acquaint your ladyship with one particular fancy of my own contrary to the common method which be all i be able to contribute to your service in this affair the charge of the tutor you shall provide for your son upon the choice of whom depend the whole success of hi education have several other great and considerable part and duty require in so important a trust besides that of which i be about to speak these however i shall not mention a be unable to add anything of moment to the common rule and in this wherein i take upon me to advise he may follow it so far only a it shall appear advisable for a boy of quality then who pretend to letter not upon the account of profit for so mean an object be unworthy of the grace and favour of the mus and moreover in it a man direct hi service to and depend upon other nor so much for outward ornament a for hi own proper and peculiar use and to furnish and enrich himself within have rather a desire to come out an accomplished cavalier than a mere scholar or learn man for such a one i say i would also have hi friend solicitous to find him out a tutor who have rather a wellmade than a wellfilled head seek indeed both the one and the other but rather of the two to prefer manner and judgment to mere learning and that this man should exercise hi charge after a new method ti the custom of pedagogue to be eternally thunder in their pupil ear a they be pour into a funnel whilst the business of the pupil be only to repeat what the other have say now i would have a tutor to correct this error and that at the very first he should accord to the capacity he have to deal with put it to the test permit hi pupil himself to taste thing and of himself to discern and choose them sometimes open the way to him and sometimes leave him to open it for himself that be i would not have him alone to invent and speak but that he should also hear hi pupil speak in turn socrates and since him arcesilaus make first their scholar speak and then they speak to them it be good to make him like a young horse trot before him that he may judge of hi go and how much he be to abate of hi own speed to accommodate himself to the vigour and capacity of the other for want of which due proportion we spoil all which also to know how to adjust and to keep within an exact and due measure be one of the hard thing i know and tis the effect of a high and welltempered soul to know how to condescend to such puerile motion and to govern and direct them i walk firm and more secure up hill than down such a accord to our common way of teach undertake with one and the same lesson and the same measure of direction to instruct several boy of differ and unequal capacity be infinitely mistaken and ti no wonder if in a whole multitude of scholar there be not find above two or three who bring away any good account of their time and discipline let the master not only examine him about the grammatical construction of the bare word of hi lesson but about the sense and let him judge of the profit he have make not by the testimony of hi memory but by that of hi life let him make him put what he have learn into a hundred several form and accommodate it to so many several subject to see if he yet rightly comprehend it and have make it hi own take instruction of hi progress by the pedagogic institution of plato ti a sign of crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we eat in the same condition it be swallow the stomach have not perform it office unless it have alter the form and condition of what be commit to it to concoct our mind work only upon trust when bound and compel to follow the appetite of anothers fancy enslave and captivate under the authority of anothers instruction we have be so subject to the trammel that we have no free nor natural pace of our own our own vigour and liberty be extinct and go i be privately carry at pisa to see a very honest man but so great an aristotelian that hi most usual thesis be that the touchstone and square of all solid imagination and of all truth be an absolute conformity to aristotle doctrine and that all besides be nothing but inanity and chimera for that he have see all and say all a position that for have be a little too injuriously and broadly interpret bring him once and long keep him in great danger of the inquisition at rome let him make him examine and thoroughly sift everything he read and lodge nothing in hi fancy upon simple authority and upon trust aristotle principle will then be no more principle to him than those of epicurus and the stoic let this diversity of opinion be propound to and lay before him he will himself choose if he be able if not he will remain in doubt for if he embrace the opinion of xenophon and plato by hi own reason they will no more be theirs but become hi own who follow another follow nothing find nothing nay be inquisitive after nothing let him at least know that he know it will be necessary that he imbibe their knowledge not that he be corrupt with their precept and no matter if he forget where he have hi learning provide he know how to apply it to hi own use truth and reason be common to every one and be no more hi who spake them first than hi who speak them after ti no more accord to plato than accord to me since both he and i equally see and understand them bee cull their several sweet from this flower and that blossom here and there where they find them but themselves afterwards make the honey which be all and purely their own and no more thyme and marjoram so the several fragment he borrow from other he will transform and shuffle together to compile a work that shall be absolutely hi own that be to say hi judgment hi instruction labour and study tend to nothing els but to form that he be not oblige to discover whence he get the material that have assist him but only to produce what he have himself do with them men that live upon pillage and borrow expose their purchase and building to every one view but do not proclaim how they come by the money we do not see the fee and perquisite of a gentleman of the long robe but we see the alliance wherewith he fortify himself and hi family and the title and honour he have obtain for him and hi no man divulge hi revenue or at least which way it come in but every one publish hi acquisition the advantage of our study be to become good and more wise ti say epicharmus the understanding that see and hear tis the understanding that improve everything that order everything and that act rule and reign all other faculty be blind and deaf and without soul and certainly we render it timorous and servile in not allow it the liberty and privilege to do anything of itself whoever ask hi pupil what he think of grammar and rhetoric or of such and such a sentence of cicero our master stick them full feather in our memory and there establish them like oracle of which the letter and syllable be of the substance of the thing to know by rote be no knowledge and signify no more but only to retain what one have intrust to our memory that which a man rightly know and understand he be the free disposer of at hi own full liberty without any regard to the author from whence he have it or fumble over the leaf of hi book a mere bookish learning be a poor paltry learn it may serve for ornament but there be yet no foundation for any superstructure to be build upon it accord to the opinion of plato who say that constancy faith and sincerity be the true philosophy and the other science that be direct to other end mere adulterate paint i could wish that paluel or pompey those two note dancer of my time could have teach u to cut caper by only see them do it without stir from our place a these men pretend to inform the understanding without ever set it to work or that we could learn to ride handle a pike touch a lute or sing without the trouble of practice a these attempt to make u judge and speak well without exercise u in judge or speak now in this initiation of our study in their progress whatsoever present itself before u be book sufficient a roguish trick of a page a sottish mistake of a servant a jest at the table be so many new subject and for this reason conversation with men be of very great use and travel into foreign country not to bring back a most of our young monsieur do an account only of how many pace santa rotonda be in circuit or of the richness of signora livias petticoats or a some other how much nero face in a statue in such an old ruin be longer and broad than that make for him on some medal but to be able chiefly to give an account of the humour manner custom and law of those nation where he have be and that we may whet and sharpen our wit by rub them against those of other i would that a boy should be send abroad very young and first so a to kill two bird with one stone into those neighbouring nation whose language be most differ from our own and to which if it be not form betimes the tongue will grow too stiff to bend and also tis the general opinion of all that a child should not be bring up in hi mother lap mother be too tender and their natural affection be apt to make the most discreet of them all so overfond that they can neither find in their heart to give them due correction for the fault they may commit nor suffer them to be inure to hardship and hazard a they ought to be they will not endure to see them return all dust and sweat from their exercise to drink cold drink when they be hot nor see them mount an unruly horse nor take a foil in hand against a rude fencer or so much a to discharge a carbine and yet there be no remedy whoever will breed a boy to be good for anything when he come to be a man must by no mean spare him when young and must very often transgress the rule of physic it be not enough to fortify hi soul you be also to make hi sinew strong for the soul will be oppress if not assist by the member and would have too hard a task to discharge two office alone i know very well to my cost how much mine groan under the burden from be accommodate with a body so tender and indisposed a eternally lean and press upon her and often in my reading perceive that our master in their writing make example pas for magnanimity and fortitude of mind which really be rather toughness of skin and hardness of bone for i have see men woman and child naturally bear of so hard and insensible a constitution of body that a sound cudgelling have be less to them than a flirt with a finger would have be to me and that would neither cry out wince nor shrink for a good swinging beating and when wrestler counterfeit the philosopher in patience ti rather strength of nerve than stoutness of heart now to be inure to undergo labour be to be accustom to endure pain a boy be to be break in to the toil and roughness of exercise so a to be train up to the pain and suffering of dislocation cholics cautery and even imprisonment and the rack itself for he may come by misfortune to be reduce to the bad of these which a this world go be sometimes inflict on the good as well a the bad a for proof in our present civil war whoever draw hi sword against the law threaten the honest men with the whip and the halter and moreover by live at home the authority of this governor which ought to be sovereign over the boy he have receive into hi charge be often check and hinder by the presence of parent to which may also be add that the respect the whole family pay him a their master son and the knowledge he have of the estate and greatness he be heir to be in my opinion no small inconvenience in these tender year and yet even in this conversing with men i speak of but now i have observe this vice that instead of gather observation from other we make it our whole business to lay ourselves open to them and be more concerned how to expose and set out our own commodity than how to increase our stock by acquire new silence therefore and modesty be very advantageous quality in conversation one should therefore train up this boy to be spar and an husband of hi knowledge when he have acquire it and to forbear take exception at or reprove every idle say or ridiculous story that be say or tell in hi presence for it be a very unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything that be not agreeable to our own palate let him be satisfy with correct himself and not seem to condemn everything in another he would not do himself nor dispute it a against common custom let him avoid these vain and uncivil image of authority this childish ambition of covet to appear well breed and more accomplished than he really will by such carriage discover himself to be and a if opportunity of interrupting and reprehend be not to be omit to desire thence to derive the reputation of something more than ordinary for a it become none but great poet to make use of the poetical licence so it be intolerable for any but men of great and illustrious soul to assume privilege above the authority of custom let him be instruct not to engage in discourse or dispute but with a champion worthy of him and even there not to make use of all the little subtlety that may seem pat for hi purpose but only such argument a may best serve him let him be teach to be curious in the election and choice of hi reason to abominate impertinence and consequently to affect brevity but above all let him be lesson to acquiesce and submit to truth so soon a ever he shall discover it whether in hi opponent argument or upon good consideration of hi own for he shall never be prefer to the chair for a mere clatter of word and syllogism and be no far engage to any argument whatever than a he shall in hi own judgment approve it nor yet be argue a trade where the liberty of recantation and get off upon good thought be to be sell for ready money if hi governor be of my humour he will form hi will to be a very good and loyal subject to hi prince very affectionate to hi person and very stout in hi quarrel but withal he will cool in him the desire of have any other tie to hi service than public duty besides several other inconvenience that be inconsistent with the liberty every honest man ought to have a man judgment be bribe and prepossess by these particular obligation be either blinded and less free to exercise it function or be blemish with ingratitude and indiscretion a man that be purely a courtier can neither have power nor will to speak or think otherwise than favourably and well of a master who amongst so many million of other subject have pick out him with hi own hand to nourish and advance this favour and the profit flow from it must need and not without some show of reason corrupt hi freedom and dazzle him and we commonly see these people speak in another kind of phrase than be ordinarily speak by other of the same nation though what they say in that courtly language be not much to be believe let hi conscience and virtue be eminently manifest in hi speaking and have only reason for their guide make him understand that to acknowledge the error he shall discover in hi own argument though only find out by himself be an effect of judgment and sincerity which be the principal thing he be to seek after that obstinacy and contention be common quality most appear in mean soul that to revise and correct himself to forsake an unjust argument in the height and heat of dispute be rare great and philosophical quality let him be advise be in company to have hi eye and ear in every corner for i find that the place of great honour be commonly seize upon by men that have least in them and that the great fortune be seldom accompany with the ablest part i have be present when whilst they at the upper end of the chamber have be only comment the beauty of the arras or the flavour of the wine many thing that have be very finely say at the low end of the table have be lose and throw away let him examine every man talent a peasant a bricklayer a passenger one may learn something from every one of these in their several capacity and something will be pick out of their discourse whereof some use may be make at one time or another nay even the folly and impertinence of other will contribute to hi instruction by observe the grace and manner of all he see he will create to himself an emulation of the good and a contempt of the bad let an honest curiosity be suggest to hi fancy of be inquisitive after everything whatever there be singular and rare near the place where he be let him go and see it a fine house a noble fountain an eminent man the place where a battle have be anciently fight the passage of caesar and charlemagne let him inquire into the manner revenue and alliance of prince thing in themselves very pleasant to learn and very useful to know in this conversing with men i mean also and principally those who only live in the record of history he shall by read those book converse with the great and heroic soul of the best age tis an idle and vain study to those who make it so by do it after a negligent manner but to those who do it with care and observation ti a study of inestimable fruit and value and the only study a plato report that the lacedaemonians reserve to themselves what profit shall he not reap a to the business of men by read the life of plutarch but withal let my governor remember to what end hi instruction be principally direct and that he do not so much imprint in hi pupil memory the date of the ruin of carthage a the manner of hannibal and scipio nor so much where marcellus die a why it be unworthy of hi duty that he die there let him not teach him so much the narrative part of history a to judge them the reading of them in my opinion be a thing that of all other we apply ourselves unto with the most differing measure i have read a hundred thing in livy that another have not or not take notice of at least and plutarch have read a hundred more there than ever i could find or than peradventure that author ever write to some it be merely a grammar study to other the very anatomy of philosophy by which the most abstruse part of our human nature penetrate there be in plutarch many long discourse very worthy to be carefully read and observe for he be in my opinion of all other the great master in that kind of write but there be a thousand other which he have only touch and glance upon where he only point with hi finger to direct u which way we may go if we will and content himself sometimes with give only one brisk hit in the nice article of the question whence we be to grope out the rest a for example where he say that the inhabitant of asia come to be vassal to one only for not have be able to pronounce one syllable which be no which say of hi give perhaps matter and occasion to la boetie to write hi voluntary servitude only to see him pick out a light action in a mans life or a mere word that do not seem to amount even to that be itself a whole discourse ti to our prejudice that men of understanding should so immoderately affect brevity no doubt their reputation be the good by it but in the meantime we be the bad plutarch have rather we should applaud hi judgment than commend hi knowledge and have rather leave u with an appetite to read more than glut with that we have already read he know very well that a man may say too much even upon the best subject and that alexandridas justly reproach him who make very good but too long speech to the ephori when he say o stranger thou speakest the thing thou shouldst speak but not a thou shouldst speak them such a have lean and spare body stuff themselves out with clothes so they who be defective in matter endeavour to make amends with word human understanding be marvellously enlighten by daily conversation with men for we be otherwise compress and heap up in ourselves and have our sight limit to the length of our own nose one ask socrates of what country he be he do not make answer of athens but of the world he whose imagination be fuller and wider embrace the whole world for hi country and extend hi society and friendship to all mankind not a we do who look no further than our foot when the vine of my village be nip with the frost my parish priest presently conclude that the indignation of god have go out against all the human race and that the cannibal have already get the pip who be it that see the havoc of these civil war of ours do not cry out that the machine of the world be near dissolution and that the day of judgment be at hand without consider that many bad thing have be see and that in the meantime people be very merry in a thousand other part of the earth for all this for my part consider the licence and impunity that always attend such commotion i wonder they be so moderate and that there be no more mischief do to him who feel the hailstone patter about hi ear the whole hemisphere appear to be in storm and tempest like the ridiculous savoyard who say very gravely that if that simple king of france could have manage hi fortune a he should have do he might in time have come to have be steward of the household to the duke hi master the fellow could not in hi shallow imagination conceive that there could be anything great than a duke of savoy and in truth we be all of u insensibly in this error an error of a very great weight and very pernicious consequence but whoever shall represent to hi fancy a in a picture that great image of our mother nature in her full majesty and lustre whoever in her face shall read so general and so constant a variety whoever shall observe himself in that figure and not himself but a whole kingdom no big than the least touch or prick of a pencil in comparison of the whole that man alone be able to value thing accord to their true estimate and grandeur this great world which some do yet multiply a several specie under one genus be the mirror wherein we be to behold ourselves to be able to know ourselves a we ought to do in the true bias in short i would have this to be the book my young gentleman should study with the most attention so many humour so many sect so many judgment opinion law and custom teach u to judge aright of our own and inform our understand to discover it imperfection and natural infirmity which be no trivial speculation so many mutation of state and kingdom and so many turn and revolution of public fortune will make u wise enough to make no great wonder of our own so many great name so many famous victory and conquest drown and swallow in oblivion render our hope ridiculous of eternise our name by the taking of halfascore of light horse or a henroost which only derive it memory from it ruin the pride and arrogance of so many foreign pomp the inflated majesty of so many court and grandeur accustom and fortify our sight without close our eye to behold the lustre of our own so many trillion of men bury before u encourage u not to fear to go seek such good company in the other world and so of the rest pythagoras be want to say that our life resemble the great and populous assembly of the olympic game wherein some exercise the body that they may carry away the glory of the prize other bring merchandise to sell for profit there be also some and those none of the bad sort who pursue no other advantage than only to look on and consider how and why everything be do and to be spectator of the life of other men thereby the good to judge of and regulate their own to example may fitly be apply all the profitable discourse of philosophy to which all human action a to their best rule ought to be especially direct a scholar shall be teach to know what it be to know and what to be ignorant what ought to be the end and design of study what valour temperance and justice be the difference betwixt ambition and avarice servitude and subjection licence and liberty by what token a man may know true and solid contentment how far death affliction and disgrace be to be apprehend by what secret spring we move and the reason of our various agitation and irresolution for methinks the first doctrine with which one should season hi understand ought to be that which regulate hi manner and hi sense that teach him to know himself and how both well to dig and well to live amongst the liberal science let u begin with that which make u free not that they do not all serve in some measure to the instruction and use of life a all other thing in some sort also do but let u make choice of that which directly and professedly serf to that end if we be once able to restrain the office of human life within their just and natural limit we shall find that most of the science in use be of no great use to u and even in those that be that there be many very unnecessary cavity and dilatation which we have well let alone and follow socrates direction limit the course of our study to those thing only where be a true and real utility ti a great foolery to teach our child the knowledge of the star and the motion of the eighth sphere before their own anaximenes write to pythagoras to what purpose say he should i trouble myself in search out the secret of the star have death or slavery continually before my eye for the king of persia be at that time prepare to invade hi country every one ought to say thus being assault a i be by ambition avarice temerity superstition and have within so many other enemy of life shall i go ponder over the world change after have teach him what will make him more wise and good you may then entertain him with the element of logic physic geometry rhetoric and the science which he shall then himself most incline to hi judgment be beforehand form and fit to choose he will quickly make hi own the way of instruct him ought to be sometimes by discourse and sometimes by read sometimes hi governor shall put the author himself which he shall think most proper for him into hi hand and sometimes only the marrow and substance of it and if himself be not conversant enough in book to turn to all the fine discourse the book contain for hi purpose there may some man of learn be join to him that upon every occasion shall supply him with what he stand in need of to furnish it to hi pupil and who can doubt but that this way of teaching be much more easy and natural than that of gaza in which the precept be so intricate and so harsh and the word so vain lean and insignificant that there be no hold to be take of them nothing that quickens and elevate the wit and fancy whereas here the mind have what to fee upon and to digest this fruit therefore be not only without comparison much more fair and beautiful but will also be much more early ripe ti a thousand pity that matter should be at such a pas in this age of ours that philosophy even with men of understanding should be look upon a a vain and fantastic name a thing of no use no value either in opinion or effect of which i think those ergotism and petty sophistry by prepossess the avenue to it be the cause and people be much to blame to represent it to child for a thing of so difficult access and with such a frowning grim and formidable aspect who be it that have disguise it thus with this false pale and ghostly countenance there be nothing more airy more gay more frolic and i have like to have say more wanton she preach nothing but feasting and jollity a melancholic anxious look show that she do not inhabit there demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of delphos a knot of philosopher set chat together say to them either i be much deceive or by your cheerful and pleasant countenance you be engage in no very deep discourse to which one of them heracleon the megarean reply ti for such a be puzzle about inquire whether the future tense of the verb be spell with a double a or that hunt after the derivation of the comparative and the superlative and to knit their brow whilst discourse of their science but a to philosophical discourse they always divert and cheer up those that entertain them and never deject them or make them sad the soul that lodge philosophy ought to be of such a constitution of health a to render the body in like manner healthful too she ought to make her tranquillity and satisfaction shine so a to appear without and her contentment ought to fashion the outward behaviour to her own mould and consequently to fortify it with a graceful confidence an active and joyous carriage and a serene and content countenance the most manifest sign of wisdom be a continual cheerfulness her state be like that of thing in the region above the moon always clear and serene ti baroco and baralipton that render their disciple so dirty and illfavoured and not she they do not so much a know her but by hearsay what it be she that calm and appease the storm and tempest of the soul and who teach famine and fever to laugh and sing and that not by certain imaginary epicycle but by natural and manifest reason she have virtue for her end which be not a the schoolman say situate upon the summit of a perpendicular rugged inaccessible precipice such a have approach her find her quite on the contrary to be seat in a fair fruitful and flourish plain whence she easily discover all thing below to which place any one may however arrive if he know but the way through shady green and sweetlyflourishing avenue by a pleasant easy and smooth descent like that of the celestial vault ti for not have frequent this supreme this beautiful triumphant and amiable this equally delicious and courageous virtue this so professed and implacable enemy to anxiety sorrow fear and constraint who have nature for her guide have fortune and pleasure for her companion that they have go accord to their own weak imagination and create this ridiculous this sorrowful querulous despiteful threaten terrible image of it to themselves and other and place it upon a rock apart amongst thorn and bramble and make of it a hobgoblin to affright people but the governor that i would have that be such a one a know it to be hi duty to possess hi pupil with as much or more affection than reverence to virtue will be able to inform him that the poet have evermore accommodate themselves to the public humour and make him sensible that the god have plant more toil and sweat in the avenue of the cabinet of venus than in those of minerva and when he shall once find him begin to apprehend and shall represent to him a bradamante or an angelica for a mistress a natural active generous and not a viragoish but a manly beauty in comparison of a soft delicate artificial simpering and affected form the one in the habit of a heroic youth wear a glittering helmet the other trick up in curl and ribbon like a wanton minx he will then look upon hi own affection a brave and masculine when he shall choose quite contrary to that effeminate shepherd of phrygia such a tutor will make a pupil digest this new lesson that the height and value of true virtue consist in the facility utility and pleasure of it exercise so far from difficulty that boys as well a men and the innocent as well a the subtle may make it their own it be by order and not by force that it be to be acquire socrates her first minion be so averse to all manner of violence a totally to throw it aside to slip into the more natural facility of her own progress ti the nursing mother of all human pleasure who in render them just render them also pure and permanent in moderate them keep them in breath and appetite in interdict those which she herself refuse whets our desire to those that she allow and like a kind and liberal mother abundantly allow all that nature require even to satiety if not to lassitude unless we mean to say that the regimen which stop the toper before he have drink himself drink the glutton before he have eat to a surfeit and the lecher before he have get the pox be an enemy to pleasure if the ordinary fortune fail she do without it and form another wholly her own not so fickle and unsteady a the other she can be rich be potent and wise and know how to lie upon soft perfume bed she love life beauty glory and health but her proper and peculiar office be to know how to regulate the use of all these good thing and how to lose them without concern an office much more noble than troublesome and without which the whole course of life be unnatural turbulent and deform and there it be indeed that men may justly represent those monster upon rock and precipice if this pupil shall happen to be of so contrary a disposition that he have rather hear a tale of a tub than the true narrative of some noble expedition or some wise and learned discourse who at the beat of drum that excite the youthful ardour of hi companion leave that to follow another that call to a morris or the bear who would not wish and find it more delightful and more excellent to return all dust and sweat victorious from a battle than from tennis or from a ball with the prize of those exercise i see no other remedy but that he be bind prentice in some good town to learn to make minced pie though he be the son of a duke accord to plato precept that child be to be place out and disposed of not accord to the wealth quality or condition of the father but accord to the faculty and the capacity of their own soul since philosophy be that which instruct u to live and that infancy have there it lesson as well a other age why be it not communicate to child betimes they begin to teach u to live when we have almost do live a hundred student have get the pox before they have come to read aristotle lecture on temperance cicero say that though he should live two men age he should never find leisure to study the lyric poet and i find these sophist yet more deplorably unprofitable the boy we would breed have a great deal less time to spare he owe but the first fifteen or sixteen year of hi life to education the remainder be due to action let u therefore employ that short time in necessary instruction away with the thorny subtlety of dialectic they be abuse thing by which our life can never be amend take the plain philosophical discourse learn how rightly to choose and then rightly to apply them they be more easy to be understood than one of boccaccio novel a child from nurse be much more capable of them than of learn to read or to write philosophy have discourse proper for childhood as well a for the decrepit age of men i be of plutarch mind that aristotle do not so much trouble hi great disciple with the knack of form syllogism or with the element of geometry a with infuse into him good precept concern valour prowess magnanimity temperance and the contempt of fear and with this ammunition send him whilst yet a boy with no more than thirty thousand foot four thousand horse and but fortytwo thousand crown to subjugate the empire of the whole earth for the other act and science he say alexander highly indeed commend their excellence and charm and have them in very great honour and esteem but not ravish with them to that degree a to be tempt to affect the practice of them in hi own person epicurus in the beginning of hi letter to meniceus say that neither the young should refuse to philosophise nor the old grow weary of it who do otherwise seem tacitly to imply that either the time of live happily be not yet come or that it be already past and yet a for all that i would not have this pupil of ours imprison and make a slave to hi book nor would i have him give up to the moros and melancholic humour of a sour illnatured pedant i would not have hi spirit cow and subdue by apply him to the rack and torment him a some do fourteen or fifteen hour a day and so make a packhorse of him neither should i think it good when by reason of a solitary and melancholic complexion he be discover to be overmuch addict to hi book to nourish that humour in him for that render him unfit for civil conversation and divert him from good employment and how many have i see in my time totally brutified by an immoderate thirst after knowledge carneades be so besotted with it that he would not find time so much a to comb hi head or to pare hi nail neither would i have hi generous manner spoil and corrupt by the incivility and barbarism of those of another the french wisdom be anciently turn into proverb early but of no continuance and in truth we yet see that nothing can be more ingenious and please than the child of france but they ordinarily deceive the hope and expectation that have be conceive of them and grow up to be men have nothing extraordinary or worth take notice of i have hear men of good understand say these college of ours to which we send our young people and of which we have but too many make them such animal a they be but to our little monsieur a closet a garden the table hi bed solitude and company morning and even all hour shall be the same and all place to him a study for philosophy who a the formatrix of judgment and manner shall be hi principal lesson have that privilege to have a hand in everything the orator isocrates be at a feast entreat to speak of hi art all the company be satisfied with and commend hi answer it be not now a time say he to do what i can do and that which it be now time to do i can not do for to make oration and rhetorical dispute in a company meet together to laugh and make good cheer have be very unreasonable and improper and as much might have be say of all the other science but a to what concern philosophy that part of it at least that treat of man and of hi office and duty it have be the common opinion of all wise men that out of respect to the sweetness of her conversation she be ever to be admit in all sport and entertainment and plato have invite her to hi feast we see after how gentle and oblige a manner accommodate both to time and place she entertain the company though in a discourse of the high and most important nature by this method of instruction my young pupil will be much more and good employ than hi fellow of the college be but a the step we take in walk to and fro in a gallery though three time a many do not tire a man so much a those we employ in a formal journey so our lesson a it be accidentally occur without any set obligation of time or place and fall naturally into every action will insensibly insinuate itself by which mean our very exercise and recreation run wrestle music dance hunt riding and fencing will prove to be a good part of our study i would have hi outward fashion and mien and the disposition of hi limb form at the same time with hi mind ti not a soul ti not a body that we be train up but a man and we ought not to divide him and a plato say we be not to fashion one without the other but make them draw together like two horse harness to a coach by which say of hi do he not seem to allow more time for and to take more care of exercise for the body and to hold that the mind in a good proportion do her business at the same time too a to the rest this method of education ought to be carry on with a severe sweetness quite contrary to the practice of our pedant who instead of tempt and allure child to letter by apt and gentle way do in truth present nothing before them but rod and ferule horror and cruelty away with this violence away with this compulsion than which i certainly believe nothing more dulls and degenerate a welldescended nature if you would have him apprehend shame and chastisement do not harden him to them inure him to heat and cold to wind and sun and to danger that he ought to despise wean him from all effeminacy and delicacy in clothes and lodge eating and drinking accustom him to everything that he may not be a sir paris a carpetknight but a sinewy hardy and vigorous young man i have ever from a child to the age wherein i now be be of this opinion and be still constant to it but amongst other thing the strict government of most of our college have evermore displease me peradventure they might have err less perniciously on the indulgent side ti a real house of correction of imprison youth they be make debauch by be punish before they be so do but come in when they be about their lesson and you shall hear nothing but the outcry of boy under execution with the thunder noise of their pedagogue drink with fury a very pretty way this to tempt these tender and timorous soul to love their book with a furious countenance and a rod in hand a curse and pernicious way of proceed besides what quintilian have very well observe that this imperious authority be often attend by very dangerous consequence and particularly our way of chastise how much more decent would it be to see their class strew with green leaf and fine flower than with the bloody stump of birch and willow be it leave to my order i should paint the school with the picture of joy and gladness flora and the grace a the philosopher speusippus do hi where their profit be let them there have their pleasure too such viand a be proper and wholesome for child should be sweeten with sugar and such a be dangerous to them embitter with gall ti marvellous to see how solicitous plato be in hi law concern the gaiety and diversion of the youth of hi city and how much and often he enlarge upon the race sport song leap and dance of which he say that antiquity have give the ordering and patronage particularly to the god themselves to apollo minerva and the mus he insist long upon and be very particular in give innumerable precept for exercise but a to the letter science say very little and only seem particularly to recommend poetry upon the account of music all singularity in our manner and condition be to be avoid a inconsistent with civil society who would not be astonish at so strange a constitution a that of demophoon steward to alexander the great who sweat in the shade and shiver in the sun i have see those who have run from the smell of a mellow apple with great precipitation than from a harquebussshot other afraid of a mouse other vomit at the sight of cream other ready to swoon at the making of a feather bed germanicus could neither endure the sight nor the crowing of a cock i will not deny but that there may peradventure be some occult cause and natural aversion in these case but in my opinion a man might conquer it if he take it in time precept have in this wrought so effectually upon me though not without some pain on my part i confess that beer except my appetite accommodate itself indifferently to all sort of diet young body be supple one should therefore in that age bend and ply them to all fashion and custom and provide a man can contain the appetite and the will within their due limit let a young man in god name be render fit for all nation and all company even to debauchery and excess if need be that be where he shall do it out of complacency to the custom of the place let him be able to do everything but love to do nothing but what be good the philosopher themselves do not justify callisthenes for forfeit the favour of hi master alexander the great by refuse to pledge him a cup of wine let him laugh play wench with hi prince nay i would have him even in hi debauch too hard for the rest of the company and to excel hi companion in ability and vigour and that he may not give over do it either through defect of power or knowledge how to do it but for want of will i think i pass a compliment upon a lord a free from those excess a any man in france by ask him before a great deal of very good company how many time in hi life he have be drink in germany in the time of hi be there about hi majesty affair which he also take a it be intend and make answer three time and withal tell u the whole story of hi debauch i know some who for want of this faculty have find a great inconvenience in negotiate with that nation i have often with great admiration reflect upon the wonderful constitution of alcibiades who so easily could transform himself to so various fashion without any prejudice to hi health one while outdo the persian pomp and luxury and another the lacedaemonian austerity and frugality a reform in sparta a voluptuous in ionia i would have my pupil to be such an one these be my lesson and he who put them in practice shall reap more advantage than he who have have them read to him only and so only know them if you see him you hear him if you hear him you see him god forbid say one in plato that to philosophise be only to read a great many book and to learn the art leo prince of the phliasians ask heraclides ponticus of what art or science he make profession i know say he neither art nor science but i be a philosopher one reproaching diogenes that be ignorant he should pretend to philosophy i therefore answer he pretend to it with so much the more reason hegesias entreat that he would read a certain book to him you be pleasant say he you choose those fig that be true and natural and not those that be paint why do you not also choose exercise which be naturally true rather than those write the lad will not so much get hi lesson by heart a he will practise it he will repeat it in hi action we shall discover if there be prudence in hi exercise if there be sincerity and justice in hi deportment if there be grace and judgment in hi speaking if there be constancy in hi sickness if there be modesty in hi mirth temperance in hi pleasure order in hi domestic economy indifference in palate whether what he eat or drink be flesh or fish wine or water the conduct of our life be the true mirror of our doctrine zeuxidamus to one who ask him why the lacedaemonians do not commit their constitution of chivalry to write and deliver them to their young men to read make answer that it be because they would inure them to action and not amuse them with word with such a one after fifteen or sixteen year study compare one of our college latinist who have throw away so much time in nothing but learn to speak the world be nothing but babble and i hardly ever yet saw that man who do not rather prate too much than speak too little and yet half of our age be embezzle this way we be kept four or five year to learn word only and to tack them together into clause a many more to form them into a long discourse divide into four or five part and other five year at least to learn succinctly to mix and interweave them after a subtle and intricate manner let u leave all this to those who make a profession of it go one day to orleans i meet in that plain on this side clery two pedant who be travel towards bordeaux about fifty pace distant from one another and a good way far behind them i discover a troop of horse with a gentleman at the head of them who be the late monsieur le comte de la rochefoucauld one of my people inquire of the foremost of these master of art who that gentleman be that come after him he have not see the train that follow after and think hi companion be mean pleasantly answer he be not a gentleman he be a grammarian and i be a logician now we who quite contrary do not here pretend to breed a grammarian or a logician but a gentleman let u leave them to abuse their leisure our business lie elsewhere let but our pupil be well furnish with thing word will follow but too fast he will pull them after him if they do not voluntarily follow i have observe some to make excuse that they can not express themselves and pretend to have their fancy full of a great many very fine thing which yet for want of eloquence they can not utter ti a mere shift and nothing els will you know what i think of it i think they be nothing but shadow of some imperfect image and conception that they know not what to make of within nor consequently bring out they do not yet themselves understand what they would be at and if you but observe how they haggle and stammer upon the point of parturition you will soon conclude that their labour be not to delivery but about conception and that they be but lick their formless embryo for my part i hold and socrates command it that whoever have in hi mind a sprightly and clear imagination he will express it well enough in one kind of tongue or another and if he be dumb by sign and as another a poetically say in hi prose he know nothing of ablative conjunctive substantive or grammar no more than hi lackey or a fishwife of the petit pont and yet these will give you a bellyful of talk if you will hear them and peradventure shall trip as little in their language a the best master of art in france he know no rhetoric nor how in a preface to bribe the benevolence of the courteous reader neither do he care to know it indeed all this fine decoration of painting be easily efface by the lustre of a simple and blunt truth these fine flourish serve only to amuse the vulgar of themselves incapable of more solid and nutritive diet a aper very evidently demonstrate in tacitus the ambassador of samos prepare with a long and elegant oration come to cleomenes king of sparta to incite him to a war against the tyrant polycrates who after he have hear their harangue with great gravity and patience give them this answer a to the exordium i remember it not nor consequently the middle of your speech and for what concern your conclusion i will not do what you desire a very pretty answer this methinks and a pack of learn orator most sweetly gravel and what do the other man say the athenian be to choose one of two architect for a very great building they have design of these the first a pert affect fellow offer hi service in a long premeditated discourse upon the subject of the work in hand and by hi oratory incline the voice of the people in hi favour but the other in three word o athenian what this man say i will do when cicero be in the height and heat of an eloquent harangue many be strike with admiration but cato only laugh say we have a pleasant mirthmaking consul let it go before or come after a good sentence or a thing well say be always in season if it neither suit well with what go before nor have much coherence with what follow after it be good in itself i be none of those who think that good rhyme make a good poem let him make short long and long short if he will tis no great matter if there be invention and that the wit and judgment have well perform their office i will say here a good poet but an ill rhymer let a man say horace divest hi work of all method and measure he will never the more lose himself for that the very piece will be fine by themselves menander answer have this meaning who be reprove by a friend the time draw on at which he have promise a comedy that he have not yet fall in hand with it it be make and ready say he all but the verse having contrive the subject and dispose the scene in hi fancy he take little care for the rest since ronsard and du bellay have give reputation to our french poesy every little dabbler for aught i see swell hi word a high and make hi cadence very near as harmonious a they for the vulgar there be never so many poetasters a now but though they find it no hard matter to imitate their rhyme they yet fall infinitely short of imitate the rich description of the one and the delicate invention of the other of these master but what will become of our young gentleman if he be attack with the sophistic subtlety of some syllogism a westfalia ham make a man drink drink quenches thirst ergo a westfalia ham quenches thirst why let him laugh at it it will be more discretion to do so than to go about to answer it or let him borrow this pleasant evasion from aristippus why should i trouble myself to untie that which bind a it be give me so much trouble one offering at this dialectic juggling against cleanthes chrysippus take him short say reserve these bauble to play with child and do not by such foolery divert the serious thought of a man of year if these ridiculous subtlety a cicero call them be design to possess him with an untruth they be dangerous but if they signify no more than only to make him laugh i do not see why a man need to be fortify against them there be some so ridiculous a to go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word i for my part rather bring in a fine sentence by head and shoulder to fit my purpose than divert my design to hunt after a sentence on the contrary word be to serve and to follow a man purpose and let gascon come in play where french will not do i would have thing so excel and so wholly possess the imagination of him that hear that he should have something els to do than to think of word the way of speaking that i love be natural and plain the same in write a in speaking and a sinewy and muscular way of express a man self short and pithy not so elegant and artificial a prompt and vehement rather hard than wearisome free from affectation irregular incontinuous and bold where every piece make up an entire body not like a pedant a preacher or a pleader but rather a soldierlike style a suetonius call that of julius caesar and yet i see no reason why he should call it so i have ever be ready to imitate the negligent garb which be yet observable amongst the young men of our time to wear my cloak on one shoulder my cap on one side a stocking in disorder which seem to express a kind of haughty disdain of these exotic ornament and a contempt of the artificial but i find this negligence of much good use in the form of speak all affectation particularly in the french gaiety and freedom be ungraceful in a courtier and in a monarchy every gentleman ought to be fashion accord to the court model for which reason an easy and natural negligence do well i no more like a web where the knot and seam be to be see than a fine figure so delicate that a man may tell all the bone and vein that eloquence prejudice the subject it would advance that wholly attract u to itself and as in our outward habit ti a ridiculous effeminacy to distinguish ourselves by a particular and unusual garb or fashion so in language to study new phrase and to affect word that be not of current use proceeds from a puerile and scholastic ambition may i be bind to speak no other language than what be speak in the marketplace of paris aristophanes the grammarian be quite out when he reprehend epicurus for hi plain way of deliver himself and the design of hi oratory which be only perspicuity of speech the imitation of word by it own facility immediately disperse itself through a whole people but the imitation of inventing and fitly apply those word be of a slow progress the generality of reader for have find a like robe very mistakingly imagine they have the same body and inside too whereas force and sinew be never to be borrow the gloss and outward ornament that be word and elocution may most of those i converse with speak the same language i here write but whether they think the same thought i can not say the athenian say plato study ful and elegancy of speak the lacedaemonians affect brevity and those of crete to aim more at the fecundity of conception than the fertility of speech and these be the best zeno use to say that he have two sort of disciple one that he call cy ous curious to learn thing and these be hi favourite the other aoy ous that care for nothing but word not that fine speaking be not a very good and commendable quality but not so excellent and so necessary a some would make it and i be scandalise that our whole life should be spend in nothing els i would first understand my own language and that of my neighbour with whom most of my business and conversation lie no doubt but greek and latin be very great ornament and of very great use but we buy them too dear i will here discover one way which have be experiment in my own person by which they be to be have well cheap and such may make use of it a will my late father have make the most precise inquiry that any man could possibly make amongst men of the great learning and judgment of an exact method of education be by them caution of this inconvenience then in use and make to believe that the tedious time we apply to the learning of the tongue of them who have them for nothing be the sole cause we could not arrive to the grandeur of soul and perfection of knowledge of the ancient greek and roman i do not however believe that to be the only cause so it be that the expedient my father find out for this be that in my infancy and before i begin to speak he commit me to the care of a german who since die a famous physician in france totally ignorant of our language and very fluent and a great critic in latin this man whom he have fetch out of hi own country and whom he entertain with a great salary for this only one end have me continually with him he have with him also join two other of inferior learn to attend me and to relieve him these speak to me in no other language but latin a to the rest of hi household it be an inviolable rule that neither himself nor my mother nor valet nor chambermaid should speak anything in my company but such latin word a each one have learn to gabble with me it be not to be imagined how great an advantage this prove to the whole family my father and my mother by this mean learn latin enough to understand it perfectly well and to speak it to such a degree a be sufficient for any necessary use a also those of the servant do who be most frequently with me in short we latin it at such a rate that it overflow to all the neighbouring villages where there yet remain that have establish themselves by custom several latin appellation of artisan and their tool a for what concern myself i be above six year of age before i understand either french or perigordin any more than arabic and without art book grammar or precept whipping or the expense of a tear i have by that time learn to speak a pure latin a my master himself for i have no mean of mix it up with any other if for example they be to give me a theme after the college fashion they give it to other in french but to me they be to give it in bad latin to turn it into that which be good and nicolas grouchy who write a book de comitiis romanorum guillaume guerente who write a comment upon aristotle george buchanan that great scottish poet and marc antoine muret whom both france and italy have acknowledge for the best orator of hi time my domestic tutor have all of them often tell me that i have in my infancy that language so very fluent and ready that they be afraid to enter into discourse with me and particularly buchanan whom i since saw attend the late mareschal de brissac then tell me that he be about to write a treatise of education the example of which he intend to take from mine for he be then tutor to that comte de brissac who afterward prove so valiant and so brave a gentleman a to greek of which i have but a mere smatter my father also design to have it teach me by a device but a new one and by way of sport toss our declension to and fro after the manner of those who by certain game of table learn geometry and arithmetic for he amongst other rule have be advise to make me relish science and duty by an unforced will and of my own voluntary motion and to educate my soul in all liberty and delight without any severity or constraint which he be an observer of to such a degree even of superstition if i may say so that some be of opinion that it trouble and disturb the brain of child suddenly to wake them in the morning and to snatch them violentlyand overhastily from sleep wherein they be much more profoundly involved than we he cause me to be waken by the sound of some musical instrument and be never unprovided of a musician for that purpose by this example you may judge of the rest this alone be sufficient to recommend both the prudence and the affection of so good a father who be not to be blame if he do not reap fruit answerable to so exquisite a culture of this two thing be the cause first a sterile and improper soil for though i be of a strong and healthful constitution and of a disposition tolerably sweet and tractable yet i be withal so heavy idle and indispose that they could not rouse me from my sloth not even to get me out to play what i saw i saw clearly enough and under this heavy complexion nourish a bold imagination and opinion above my age i have a slow wit that would go no faster than it be lead a tardy understand a languishing invention and above all incredible defect of memory so that it be no wonder if from all these nothing considerable could be extract secondly like those who impatient of along and steady cure submit to all sort of prescription and recipes the good man be extremely timorous of any way failing in a thing he have so wholly set hi heart upon suffer himself at last to be overrule by the common opinion which always follow their leader a a flight of crane and comply with the method of the time have no more those person he have bring out of italy and who have give him the first model of education about him he send me at six year of age to the college of guienne at that time the best and most flourishing in france and there it be not possible to add anything to the care he have to provide me the most able tutor with all other circumstance of education reserve also several particular rule contrary to the college practice but so it be that with all these precaution it be a college still my latin immediately grow corrupt of which also by discontinuance i have since lose all manner of use so that this new way of education serve me to no other end than only at my first come to prefer me to the first form for at thirteen year old that i come out of the college i have run through my whole course a they call it and in truth without any manner of advantage that i can honestly brag of in all this time the first taste which i have for book come to me from the pleasure in read the fable of ovid metamorphosis for be about seven or eight year old i give up all other diversion to read them both by reason that this be my own natural language the easy book that i be acquaint with and for the subject the most accommodated to the capacity of my age for a for the lancelot of the lake the amadis of gaul the huon of bordeaux and such farrago by which child be most delighted with i have never so much a heard their name no more than i yet know what they contain so exact be the discipline wherein i be bring up but this be enough to make me neglect the other lesson that be prescribe me and here it be infinitely to my advantage to have to do with an understanding tutor who very well know discreetly to connive at this and other truantries of the same nature for by this mean i run through virgil aeneid and then terence and then plautus and then some italian comedy allure by the sweetness of the subject whereas have he be so foolish a to have take me off this diversion i do really believe i have bring away nothing from the college but a hatred of book a almost all our young gentleman do but he carry himself very discreetly in that business seem to take no notice and allow me only such time a i could steal from my other regular study which whet my appetite to devour those book for the chief thing my father expect from their endeavour to whom he have deliver me for education be affability and goodhumour and to say the truth my manner have no other vice but sloth and want of metal the fear be not that i should do ill but that i should do nothing nobody prognosticate that i should be wicked but only useless they foresee idleness but no malice and i find it fall out accordingly the complaint i hear of myself be these he be idle cold in the office of friendship and relation and in those of the public too particular too disdainful but the most injurious do not say why have he take such a thing why have he not pay such an one but why do he part with nothing why do he not give and i should take it for a favour that men would expect from me no great effect of supererogation than these but they be unjust to exact from me what i do not owe far more rigorously than they require from other that which they do owe in condemn me to it they efface the gratification of the action and deprive me of the gratitude that would be my due for it whereas the active welldoing ought to be of so much the great value from my hand by how much i have never be passive that way at all i can the more freely dispose of my fortune the more it be mine and of myself the more i be my own nevertheless if i be good at set out my own action i could peradventure very well repel these reproach and could give some to understand that they be not so much offend that i do not enough a that i be able to do a great deal more than i do yet for all this heavy disposition of mine my mind when retire into itself be not altogether without strong movement solid and clear judgment about those object it could comprehend and could also without any help digest them but amongst other thing i do really believe it have be totally impossible to have make it to submit by violence and force shall i here acquaint you with one faculty of my youth i have great assurance of countenance and flexibility of voice and gesture in apply myself to any part i undertake to act for before i play the chief part in the latin tragedy of buchanan guerente and muret that be present in our college of guienne with great dignity now andreas goveanus our principal a in all other part of hi charge be without comparison the best of that employment in france and i be look upon a one of the best actor tis an exercise that i do not disapprove in young people of condition and i have since see our prince after the example of some of the ancient in person handsomely and commend perform these exercise it be even allow to person of quality to make a profession of it in greece nay i have always tax those with impertinence who condemn these entertainment and with injustice those who refuse to admit such comedian a be worth see into our good town and grudge the people that public diversion wellgoverned corporation take care to assemble their citizen not only to the solemn duty of devotion but also to sport and spectacle they find society and friendship augment by it and besides can there possibly be allow a more orderly and regular diversion than what be perform m the sight of every one and very often in the presence of the supreme magistrate himself and i for my part should think it reasonable that the prince should sometimes gratify hi people at hi own expense out of paternal goodness and affection and that in populous city there should be theatre erect for such entertainment if but to divert them from bad and private action to return to my subject there be nothing like allure the appetite and affection otherwise you make nothing but so many ass lade with book by dint of the lash you give them their pocketful of learn to keep whereas to do well you should not only lodge it with them but make them espouse it ti not perhaps without reason that we attribute facility of belief and easiness of persuasion to simplicity and ignorance for i fancy i have hear belief compare to the impression of a seal upon the soul which by how much soft and of less resistance it be be the more easy to be impress upon by how much the soul be more empty and without counterpoise with so much great facility it yield under the weight of the first persuasion and this be the reason that child the common people woman and sick folk be most apt to be lead by the ear but then on the other hand tis a foolish presumption to slight and condemn all thing for false that do not appear to u probable which be the ordinary vice of such a fancy themselves wise than their neighbour i be myself once one of those and if i hear talk of dead folk walk of prophecy enchantment witchcraft or any other story i have no mind to believe i presently pity the poor people that be abuse by these folly whereas i now find that i myself be to be pity a much at least a they not that experience have teach me anything to alter my former opinion though my curiosity have endeavour that way but reason have instruct me that thus resolutely to condemn anything for false and impossible be arrogantly and impiously to circumscribe and limit the will of god and the power of our mother nature within the bound of my own capacity than which no folly can be great if we give the name of monster and miracle to everything our reason can not comprehend how many be continually present before our eye let u but consider through what cloud and a it be grope in the dark our teacher lead u to the knowledge of most of the thing about u assuredly we shall find that it be rather custom than knowledge that take away their strangeness and that if those thing be now newly present to u we should think them a incredible if not more than any other he that have never see a river imagine the first he meet with to be the sea and the great thing that have fall within our knowledge we conclude the extreme that nature make of the kind the novelty rather than the greatness of thing tempts u to inquire into their cause we be to judge with more reverence and with great acknowledgment of our own ignorance and infirmity of the infinite power of nature how many unlikely thing be there testify by people worthy of faith which if we can not persuade ourselves absolutely to believe we ought at least to leave them in suspense for to condemn them a impossible be by a temerarious presumption to pretend to know the utmost bound of possibility did we rightly understand the difference betwixt the impossible and the unusual and betwixt that which be contrary to the order and course of nature and contrary to the common opinion of men in not believe rashly and on the other hand in not be too incredulous we should observe the rule of ne quid nimis enjoin by chilo when we find in froissart that the comte de foix know in bearn the defeat of john king of castile at jubera the next day after it happen and the mean by which he tell u he come to do so we may be allow to be a little merry at it a also at what our annals report that pope honorius the same day that king philip augustus die at mantis perform hi public obsequies at rome and command the like throughout italy the testimony of these author not be perhaps of authority enough to restrain u but what if plutarch besides several example that he produce out of antiquity tell u he know of certain knowledge that in the time of domitian the news of the battle lose by antony in germany be publish at rome many day journey from thence and disperse throughout the whole world the same day it be fight and if caesar be of opinion that it have often happen that the report have precede the incident shall we not say that these simple people have suffer themselves to be deceive with the vulgar for not have be so clearsighted a we be there anything more delicate more clear more sprightly than pliny judgment when he be pleased to set it to work anything more remote from vanity set aside hi learning of which i make less account in which of these excellence do any of u excel him and yet there be scarce a young schoolboy that do not convict him of untruth and that pretend not to instruct him in the progress of the work of nature when we read in bouchet the miracle of st hilarys relics away with them hi authority be not sufficient to deprive u of the liberty of contradict him but generally and offhand to condemn all suchlike story seem to me a singular impudence that great st augustin testifies to have see a blind child recover sight upon the relic of st gervasius and st protasius at milan a woman at carthage cure of a cancer by the sign of the cross make upon her by a woman newly baptize hesperius a familiar friend of hi to have drive away the spirit that haunt hi house with a little earth of the sepulchre of our lord which earth be also transport thence into the church a paralytic to have there be suddenly cure by it a woman in a procession have touch st stephen shrine with a nosegay and rub her eye with it to have recover her sight lose many year before with several other miracle of which he profess himself to have be an eyewitness of what shall we excuse him and the two holy bishop aurelius and maximinus both of whom he attest to the truth of these thing shall it be of ignorance simplicity and facility or of malice and imposture be any man now live so impudent a to think himself comparable to them in virtue piety learn judgment or any kind of perfection ti a presumption of great danger and consequence besides the absurd temerity it draw after it to contemn what we do not comprehend for after accord to your fine understanding you have establish the limit of truth and error and that afterwards there appear a necessity upon you of believe strange thing than those you have contradict you be already oblige to quit your limit now that which seem to me so much to disorder our conscience in the commotion we be now in concern religion be the catholic dispense so much with their belief they fancy they appear moderate and wise when they grant to their opponent some of the article in question but besides that they do not discern what advantage it be to those with whom we contend to begin to give ground and to retire and how much this animate our enemy to follow hi blow these article which they select a thing indifferent be sometimes of very great importance we be either wholly and absolutely to submit ourselves to the authority of our ecclesiastical polity or totally throw off all obedience to it tis not for u to determine what and how much obedience we owe to it and this i can say a have myself make trial of it that have formerly take the liberty of my own swing and fancy and omit or neglect certain rule of the discipline of our church which seem to me vain and strange come afterwards to discourse of it with learn men i have find those same thing to be build upon very good and solid ground and strong foundation and that nothing but stupidity and ignorance make u receive them with less reverence than the rest why do we not consider what contradictions we find in our own judgment how many thing be yesterday article of our faith that today appear no other than fable glory and curiosity be the scourge of the soul the last prompt u to thrust our nose into everything the other forbids u to leave anything doubtful and undecided having consider the proceeding of a painter that serve me i have a mind to imitate hi way he choose the fair place and middle of any wall or panel wherein to draw a picture which he finish with hi utmost care and art and the vacuity about it he fill with grotesque which be odd fantastic figure without any grace but what they derive from their variety and the extravagance of their shape and in truth what be these thing i scribble other than grotesque and monstrous body make of various part without any certain figure or any other than accidental order coherence or proportion in this second part i go hand in hand with my painter but fall very short of him in the first and the good my power of handle not be such that i dare to offer at a rich piece finely polished and set off accord to art i have therefore think fit to borrow one of estienne de la boetie and such a one a shall honour and adorn all the rest of my worknamely a discourse that he call voluntary servitude but since those who do not know him have properly enough call it le contr un he write in hi youth by way of essay in honour of liberty against tyrant and it have since run through the hand of men of great learning and judgment not without singular and merited commendation for it be finely write and as full a anything can possibly be and yet one may confidently say it be far short of what he be able to do and if in that more mature age wherein i have the happiness to know him he have take a design like this of mine to commit hi thought to write we should have see a great many rare thing and such a would have go very near to have rival the best writing of antiquity for in natural part especially i know no man comparable to him but he have leave nothing behind him save this treatise only and that too by chance for i believe he never saw it after it first go out of hi hand and some observation upon that edict of january make famous by our civilwars which also shall elsewhere peradventure find a place these be all i could recover of hi remains i to whom with so affectionate a remembrance upon hi deathbed he by hi last will bequeath hi library and paper the little book of hi work only except which i commit to the press and this particular obligation i have to this treatise of hi that it be the occasion of my first come acquaint with him for it be show to me long before i have the good fortune to know him and the first knowledge of hi name prove the first cause and foundation of a friendship which we afterwards improve and maintain so long a god be pleased to continue u together so perfect inviolate and entire that certainly the like be hardly to be find in story and amongst the men of this age there be no sign nor trace of any such thing in use so much concurrence be require to the building of such a one that tis much if fortune bring it but once to pass in three age there be nothing to which nature seem so much to have incline u a to society and aristotle say that the good legislator have more respect to friendship than to justice now the most supreme point of it perfection be this for generally all those that pleasure profit public or private interest create and nourish be so much the less beautiful and generous and so much the less friendship by how much they mix another cause and design and fruit in friendship than itself neither do the four ancient kind natural social hospitable venereal either separately or jointly make up a true and perfect friendship that of child to parent be rather respect friendship be nourish by communication which can not by reason of the great disparity be betwixt these but would rather perhaps offend the duty of nature for neither be all the secret thought of father fit to be communicate to child l it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt them nor can the advice and reproof which be one of the principal office of friendship be properly perform by the son to the father there be some country where twas the custom for child to kill their father and other where the father kill their child to avoid their be an impediment one to another in life and naturally the expectation of the one depend upon the ruin of the other there have be great philosopher who have make nothing of this tie of nature a aristippus for one who be press home about the affection he owe to hi child a be come out of him presently fell to spit say that this also come out of him and that we also breed worm and louse and that other that plutarch endeavour to reconcile to hi brother i make never the more account of him say he for come out of the same hole this name of brother do indeed carry with it a fine and delectable sound and for that reason he and i call one another brother but the complication of interest the division of estate and that the wealth of the one should be the property of the other strangely relax and weaken the fraternal tie brother pursue their fortune and advancement by the same path ti hardly possible but they must of necessity often jostle and hinder one another besides why be it necessary that the correspondence of manner part and inclination which beget the true and perfect friendship should always meet in these relation the father and the son may be of quite contrary humour and so of brother he be my son he be my brother but he be passionate illnatured or a fool and moreover by how much these be friendship that the law and natural obligation impose upon u so much less be there of our own choice and voluntary freedom whereas that voluntary liberty of ours have no production more promptly and properly it own than affection and friendship not that i have not in my own person experiment all that can possibly be expect of that kind have have the best and most indulgent father even to hi extreme old age that ever be and who be himself descend from a family for many generation famous and exemplary for brotherly concord we be not here to bring the love we bear to woman though it be an act of our own choice into comparison nor rank it with the other the fire of this i confess be more active more eager and more sharp but withal ti more precipitant fickle move and inconstant a fever subject to intermission and paroxysm that have seize but on one part of u whereas in friendship ti a general and universal fire but temperate and equal a constant establish heat all gentle and smooth without poignancy or roughness moreover in love ti no other than frantic desire for that which fly from u so soon a it enter unto the term of friendship that be to say into a concurrence of desire it vanishes and be go fruition destroy it a have only a fleshly end and such a one a be subject to satiety friendship on the contrary be enjoy proportion a it be desire and only grow up be nourish and improve by enjoyment a be of itself spiritual and the soul grow still more refined by practice under this perfect friendship the other fleeting affection have in my young year find some place in me to say nothing of him who himself so confess but too much in hi verse so that i have both these passion but always so that i could myself well enough distinguish them and never in any degree of comparison with one another the first maintain it flight in so lofty and so brave a place a with disdain to look down and see the other fly at a far humbler pitch below a concern marriage besides that it be a covenant the entrance into which only be free but the continuance in it force and compulsory have another dependence than that of our own free will and a bargain commonly contract to other end there almost always happen a thousand intricacy in it to unravel enough to break the thread and to divert the current of a lively affection whereas friendship have no manner of business or traffic with aught but itself moreover to say truth the ordinary talent of woman be not such a be sufficient to maintain the conference and communication require to the support of this sacred tie nor do they appear to be endue with constancy of mind to sustain the pinch of so hard and durable a knot and doubtless if without this there could be such a free and voluntary familiarity contract where not only the soul might have this entire fruition but the body also might share in the alliance and a man be engage throughout the friendship would certainly be more full and perfect but it be without example that this sex have ever yet arrive at such perfection and by the common consent of the ancient school it be wholly reject from it that other grecian licence be justly abhor by our manner which also from have accord to their practice a so necessary disparity of age and difference of office betwixt the lover answer no more to the perfect union and harmony that we here require than the other neither will that very picture that the academy present of it a i conceive contradict me when i say that this first fury inspire by the son of venus into the heart of the lover upon sight of the flower and prime of a springing and blossom youth to which they allow all the insolent and passionate effort that an immoderate ardour can produce be simply found upon external beauty the false image of corporal generation for it could not grind this love upon the soul the sight of which a yet lay conceal be but now spring and not of maturity to blossom that this fury if it seize upon a low spirit the mean by which it prefer it suit be rich present favour in advancement to dignity and such trumpery which they by no mean approve if on a more generous soul the pursuit be suitably generous by philosophical instruction precept to revere religion to obey the law to die for the good of one country by example of valour prudence and justice the lover study to render himself acceptable by the grace and beauty of the soul that of hi body be long since fade and decay hoping by this mental society to establish a more firm and lasting contract when this courtship come to effect in due season for that which they do not require in the lover namely leisure and discretion in hi pursuit they strictly require in the person love forasmuch a he be to judge of an internal beauty of difficult knowledge and abstruse discovery then there sprung in the person love the desire of a spiritual conception by the mediation of a spiritual beauty this be the principal the corporeal an accidental and secondary matter quite the contrary a to the lover for this reason they prefer the person beloved maintain that the god in like manner prefer him too and very much blame the poet aeschylus for have in the love of achilles and patroclus give the lover part to achilles who be in the first and beardless flower of hi adolescence and the handsome of all the greek after this general community the sovereign and most worthy part presiding and governing and perform it proper office they say that thence great utility be derive both by private and public concern that it constitute the force and power of the country where it prevail and the chief security of liberty and justice of which the healthy love of harmodius and aristogiton be instance and therefore it be that they call it sacred and divine and conceive that nothing but the violence of tyrant and the baseness of the common people be inimical to it finally all that can be say in favour of the academy be that it be a love which end in friendship which well enough agree with the stoical definition of love i return to my own more just and true description for the rest what we commonly call friend and friendship be nothing but acquaintance and familiarity either occasionally contract or upon some design by mean of which there happen some little intercourse betwixt our soul but in the friendship i speak of they mix and work themselves into one piece with so universal a mixture that there be no more sign of the seam by which they be first conjoin if a man should importune me to give a reason why i love him i find it could no otherwise be express than by make answer because it be he because it be i there be beyond all that i be able to say i know not what inexplicable and fated power that bring on this union we seek one another long before we meet and by the character we hear of one another which work upon our affection more than in reason mere report should do i think twas by some secret appointment of heaven we embrace in our name and at our first meeting which be accidentally at a great city entertainment we find ourselves so mutually take with one another so acquainted and so endeared betwixt ourselves that from thenceforward nothing be so near to u a one another he write an excellent latin satire since print wherein he excuse the precipitation of our intelligence so suddenly come to perfection say that destine to have so short a continuance a begin so late for we be both fullgrown men and he some year the old there be no time to lose nor be we tie to conform to the example of those slow and regular friendship that require so many precaution of long preliminary conversation this have no other idea than that of itself and can only refer to itself this be no one special consideration nor two nor three nor four nor a thousand ti i know not what quintessence of all this mixture which seize my whole will carry it to plunge and lose itself in hi and that have seize hi whole will bring it back with equal concurrence and appetite to plunge and lose itself in mine i may truly say lose reserve nothing to ourselves that be either hi or mine when laelius in the presence of the roman consul who after thay have sentence tiberius gracchus prosecute all those who have have any familiarity with him also come to ask caius blosius who be hi chief friend how much he would have do for him and that he make answer all thingshow all thing say laelius and what if he have command you to fire our templeshe would never have command me that reply blosiusbut what if he have say laeliusi would have obey him say the other if he be so perfect a friend to gracchus a the history report him to have be there be yet no necessity of offend the consul by such a bold confession though he might still have retain the assurance he have of gracchus disposition however those who accuse this answer a seditious do not well understand the mystery nor presuppose a it be true that he have gracchus will in hi sleeve both by the power of a friend and the perfect knowledge he have of the man they be more friend than citizen more friend to one another than either enemy or friend to their country or than friend to ambition and innovation have absolutely give up themselves to one another either hold absolutely the rein of the other inclination and suppose all this guide by virtue and all this by the conduct of reason which also without these it have not be possible to do blosius answer be such a it ought to be if any of their action fly out of the handle they be neither accord to my measure of friendship friend to one another nor to themselves a to the rest this answer carry no bad sound than mine would do to one that should ask me if your will should command you to kill your daughter would you do it and that i should make answer that i would for this express no consent to such an act forasmuch a i do not in the least suspect my own will and as little that of such a friend ti not in the power of all the eloquence in the world to dispossess me of the certainty i have of the intention and resolution of my friend nay no one action of hi what face soever it might bear could be present to me of which i could not presently and at first sight find out the move cause our soul have draw so unanimously together they have consider each other with so ardent an affection and with the like affection lay open the very bottom of our heart to one anothers view that i not only know hi as well a my own but should certainly in any concern of mine have trust my interest much more willingly with him than with myself let no one therefore rank other common friendship with such a one a this i have have a much experience of these a another and of the most perfect of their kind but i do not advise that any should confound the rule of the one and the other for they would find themselves much deceive in those other ordinary friendship you be to walk with bridle in your hand with prudence and circumspection for in them the knot be not so sure that a man may not half suspect it will slip love him say chilo so a if you be one day to hate him and hate him so a you be one day to love him this precept though abominable in the sovereign and perfect friendship i speak of be nevertheless very sound a to the practice of the ordinary and customary one and to which the say that aristotle have so frequent in hi mouth o my friend there be no friend may very fitly be apply in this noble commerce good office present and benefit by which other friendship be support and maintain do not deserve so much a to be mention and the reason be the concurrence of our will for a the kindness i have for myself receive no increase for anything i relieve myself withal in time of need whatever the stoic say and a i do not find myself oblige to myself for any service i do myself so the union of such friend be truly perfect deprive them of all idea of such duty and make them loathe and banish from their conversation these word of division and distinction benefit obligation acknowledgment entreaty thanks and the like all thing will thought opinion good wife child honour and life be in effect common betwixt them and that absolute concurrence of affection be no other than one soul in two body accord to that very proper definition of aristotle they can neither lend nor give anything to one another this be the reason why the lawgiver to honour marriage with some resemblance of this divine alliance interdict all gift betwixt man and wife inferring by that that all should belong to each of them and that they have nothing to divide or to give to each other if in the friendship of which i speak one could give to the other the receiver of the benefit would be the man that oblige hi friend for each of them contend and above all thing study how to be useful to the other he that administer the occasion be the liberal man in give hi friend the satisfaction of do that towards him which above all thing he most desire when the philosopher diogenes want money he use to say that he redemanded it of hi friend not that he demand it and to let you see the practical working of this i will here produce an ancient and singular example eudamidas a corinthian have two friend charixenus a sicyonian and areteus a corinthian this man come to die be poor and hi two friend rich he make hi will after this manner i bequeath to areteus the maintenance of my mother to support and provide for her in her old age and to charixenus i bequeath the care of marry my daughter and to give her as good a portion a he be able and in case one of these chance to die i hereby substitute the survivor in hi place they who first saw this will make themselves very merry at the content but the legatee be make acquaint with it accept it with very great content and one of them charixenus die within five day after and by that mean the charge of both duty devolve solely on him areteus nurture the old woman with very great care and tenderness and of five talent he have in estate he give two and a half in marriage with an only daughter he have of hi own and two and a half in marriage with the daughter of eudamidas and on one and the same day solemnise both their nuptials this example be very full if one thing be not to be object namely the multitude of friend for the perfect friendship i speak of be indivisible each one give himself so entirely to hi friend that he have nothing leave to distribute to other on the contrary be sorry that he be not double treble or quadruple and that he have not many soul and many will to confer them all upon this one object common friendship will admit of division one may love the beauty of this person the goodhumour of that the liberality of a third the paternal affection of a fourth the fraternal love of a fifth and so of the rest but this friendship that possess the whole soul and there rule and sway with an absolute sovereignty can not possibly admit of a rival if two at the same time should call to you for succour to which of them would you run should they require of you contrary office how could you serve them both should one commit a thing to your silence that it be of importance to the other to know how would you disengage yourself a unique and particular friendship dissolve all other obligation whatsoever the secret i have swear not to reveal to any other i may without perjury communicate to him who be not another but myself ti miracle enough certainly for a man to double himself and those that talk of triple talk they know not of what nothing be extreme that have it like and he who shall suppose that of two i love one as much a the other that they mutually love one another too and love me as much a i love them multiply into a confraternity the most single of unit and whereof moreover one alone be the hard thing in the world to find the rest of this story suit very well with what i be say for eudamidas a a bounty and favour bequeaths to hi friend a legacy of employ themselves in hi necessity he leave them heirs to this liberality of hi which consist in give them the opportunity of confer a benefit upon him and doubtless the force of friendship be more eminently apparent in this act of hi than in that of areteus in short these be effect not to be imagine nor comprehend by such a have not experience of them and which make me infinitely honour and admire the answer of that young soldier to cyrus by whom be ask how much he would take for a horse with which he have win the prize of a race and whether he would exchange him for a kingdom no truly sir say he but i would give him with all my heart to get thereby a true friend could i find out any man worthy of that alliance he do not say ill in say could i find for though one may almost everywhere meet with men sufficiently qualify for a superficial acquaintance yet in this where a man be to deal from the very bottom of hi heart without any manner of reservation it will be requisite that all the ward and spring be truly wrought and perfectly sure in confederation that hold but by one end we be only to provide against the imperfection that particularly concern that end it can be of no importance to me of what religion my physician or my lawyer be this consideration have nothing in common with the office of friendship which they owe me and i be of the same indifference in the domestic acquaintance my servant must necessarily contract with me i never inquire when i be to take a footman if he be chaste but if he be diligent and be not solicitous if my muleteer be give to game a if he be strong and able or if my cook be a swearer if he be a good cook i do not take upon me to direct what other men should do in the government of their family there be plenty that meddle enough with that but only give an account of my method in my own for tabletalk i prefer the pleasant and witty before the learn and the grave in bed beauty before goodness in common discourse the able speaker whether or no there be sincerity in the case and a he that be find astride upon a hobbyhorse playing with hi child entreat the person who have surprise him in that posture to say nothing of it till himself come to be a father supposing that the fondness that would then possess hi own soul would render him a fairer judge of such an action so i also could wish to speak to such a have have experience of what i say though know how remote a thing such a friendship be from the common practice and how rarely it be to be find i despair of meet with any such judge for even these discourse leave u by antiquity upon this subject seem to me flat and poor in comparison of the sense i have of it and in this particular the effect surpass even the precept of philosophy the ancient menander declare him to be happy that have have the good fortune to meet with but the shadow of a friend and doubtless he have good reason to say so especially if he speak by experience for in good earnest if i compare all the rest of my life though thanks be to god i have pass my time pleasantly enough and at my ease and the loss of such a friend except free from any grievous affliction and in great tranquillity of mind have be content with my natural and original commodity without be solicitous after other if i should compare it all i say with the four year i have the happiness to enjoy the sweet society of this excellent man ti nothing but smoke an obscure and tedious night from the day that i lose him i have only lead a languishing life and the very pleasures that present themselves to me instead of administer anything of consolation double my affliction for hi loss we be half throughout and to that degree that methinks by outlive him i defraud him of hi part i be so grown and accustom to be always hi double in all place and in all thing that methinks i be no more than half of myself there be no action or imagination of mine wherein i do not miss him a i know that he would have miss me for a he surpass me by infinite degree in virtue and all other accomplishment so he also do in the duty of friendship but let u hear a boy of sixteen speak because i have find that that work have be since bring out and with a mischievous design by those who aim at disturb and change the condition of our government without trouble themselves to think whether they be likely to improve it and because they have mix up hi work with some of their own performance i have refrain from insert it here but that the memory of the author may not be injure nor suffer with such a could not come nearhand to be acquaint with hi principle i here give them to understand that it be write by him in hi boyhood and that by way of exercise only a a common theme that have be hackneyed by a thousand writer i make no question but that he himself believe what he write be so conscientious that he would not so much a lie in jest and i moreover know that could it have be in hi own choice he have rather have be bear at venice than at sarlac and with reason but he have another maxim sovereignty imprint in hi soul very religiously to obey and submit to the law under which he be bear there never be a good citizen more affectionate to hi country nor a great enemy to all the commotion and innovation of hi time so that he would much rather have employ hi talent to the extinguishing of those civil flame than have add any fuel to them he have a mind fashion to the model of good age now in exchange of this serious piece i will present you with another of a more gay and frolic air from the same hand and write at the same age a if we have an infectious touch we by our manner of handle corrupt thing that in themselves be laudable and good we may grasp virtue so that it become vicious if we embrace it too stringently and with too violent a desire those who say there be never any excess in virtue forasmuch a it be not virtue when it once become excess only play upon word this be a subtle consideration of philosophy a man may both be too much in love with virtue and be excessive in a just action holy writ agree with this be not wise than you should but be soberly wise i have know a great man prejudice the opinion men have of hi devotion by pretend to be devout beyond all example of other of hi condition i love temperate and moderate nature an immoderate zeal even to that which be good even though it do not offend astonishes me and put me to study what name to give it neither the mother of pausanias who be the first instructor of her son process and throw the first stone towards hi death nor posthumius the dictator who put hi son to death whom the ardour of youth have successfully push upon the enemy a little more advanced than the rest of hi squadron do appear to me so much just a strange and i should neither advise nor like to follow so savage a virtue and that cost so dear the archer that shoot over miss as much a he that fall short and tis equally troublesome to my sight to look up at a great light and to look down into a dark abyss callicles in plato say that the extremity of philosophy be hurtful and advise not to dive into it beyond the limit of profit that take moderately it be pleasant and useful but that in the end it render a man brutish and vicious a contemn of religion and the common law an enemy to civil conversation and all human pleasure incapable of all public administration unfit either to assist other or to relieve himself and a fit object for all sort of injury and affront he say true for in it excess it enslave our natural freedom and by an impertinent subtlety lead u out of the fair and beaten way that nature have trace for u the love we bear to our wife be very lawful and yet theology think fit to curb and restrain it a i remember i have read in one place of st thomas aquinas where he condemn marriage within any of the forbidden degree for this reason amongst other that there be some danger lest the friendship a man bear to such a woman should be immoderate for if the conjugal affection be full and perfect betwixt them a it ought to be and that it be over and above surcharge with that of kindred too there be no doubt but such an addition will carry the husband beyond the bound of reason those science that regulate the manner of men divinity and philosophy will have their say in everything there be no action so private and secret that can escape their inspection and jurisdiction they be best taught who be best able to control and curb their own liberty woman expose their nudity as much a you will upon the account of pleasure though in the necessity of physic they be altogether a shy i will therefore in their behalf teach the husband that be such a be too vehement in the exercise of the matrimonial dutyif such there still bethis lesson that the very pleasures they enjoy in the society of their wife be reproach if immoderate and that a licentious and riotous abuse of them be a fault a reprovable here a in illicit connection those immodest and debauch trick and posture that the first ardour suggest to u in this affair be not only indecently but detrimentally practise upon our wife let them at least learn impudence from another hand they be ever ready enough for our business and i for my part always go the plain way to work marriage be a solemn and religious tie and therefore the pleasure we extract from it should be a sober and serious delight and mixed with a certain kind of gravity it should be a sort of discreet and conscientious pleasure and see that the chief end of it be generation some make a question whether when men be out of hope a when they be superannuate or already with child it be lawful to embrace our wife ti homicide accord to plato certain nation the mohammedan amongst other abominate all conjunction with woman with child other also with those who be in their course zenobia would never admit her husband for more than one encounter after which she leave him to hi own swing for the whole time of her conception and not till after that would again receive him a brave and generous example of conjugal continence it be doubtless from some lascivious poet and one that himself be in great distress for a little of this sport that plato borrow this story that jupiter be one day so hot upon hi wife that not have so much patience a till she could get to the couch he throw her upon the floor where the vehemence of pleasure make him forget the great and important resolution he have but newly take with the rest of the god in hi celestial council and to brag that he have have a good a bout a when he get her maidenhead unknown to their parent the king of persia be wont to invite their wife to the beginning of their festival but when the wine begin to work in good earnest and that they be to give the rein to pleasure they send them back to their private apartment that they might not participate in their immoderate lust send for other woman in their stead with whom they be not oblige to so great a decorum of respect all pleasure and all sort of gratification be not properly and fitly confer upon all sort of person epaminondas have commit to prison a young man for certain debauch for whom pelopidas mediate that at hi request he might be set at liberty which epaminondas deny to him but grant it at the first word to a wench of hi that make the same intercession say that it be a gratification fit for such a one a she but not for a captain sophocles be joint praetor with pericles see accidentally a fine boy pas by o what a charming boy be that say he that might be very well answered pericles for any other than a praetor who ought not only to have hi hand but hi eye too chaste aelius verus the emperor answer hi wife who reproach him with hi love to other woman that he do it upon a conscientious account forasmuch a marriage be a name of honour and dignity not of wanton and lascivious desire and our ecclesiastical history preserve the memory of that woman in great veneration who part from her husband because she would not comply with hi indecent and inordinate desire in fine there be no pleasure so just and lawful where intemperance and excess be not to be condemn but to speak the truth be not man a most miserable creature the while it be scarce by hi natural condition in hi power to taste one pleasure pure and entire and yet must he be contrive doctrine and precept to curtail that little he have he be not yet wretched enough unless by art and study he augment hi own misery human wisdom make a ill use of her talent when she exercise it in rescind from the number and sweetness of those pleasure that be naturally our due a she employ it favourably and well in artificially disguise and trick out the ill of life to alleviate the sense of them have i rule the roast i should have take another and more natural course which to say the truth be both commodious and holy and should peradventure have be able to have limit it too notwithstanding that both our spiritual and corporal physician a by compact betwixt themselves can find no other way to cure nor other remedy for the infirmity of the body and the soul than by misery and pain to this end watch fasting hairshirts remote and solitary banishment perpetual imprisonment whip and other affliction have be introduce amongst men but so that they should carry a sting with them and be real affliction indeed and not fall out a it once do to one gallio who have be send an exile into the isle of lesbos news be not long after bring to rome that he there live as merry a the day be long and that what have be enjoin him for a penance turn to hi pleasure and satisfaction whereupon the senate think fit to recall him home to hi wife and family and confine him to hi own house to accommodate their punishment to hi feeling and apprehension for to him whom fast would make more healthful and more sprightly and to him to whose palate fish be more acceptable than flesh the prescription of these would have no curative effect no more than in the other sort of physic where drug have no effect upon him who swallow them with appetite and pleasure the bitterness of the potion and the abhorrence of the patient be necessary circumstance to the operation the nature that would eat rhubarb like butter turnip would frustrate the use and virtue of it it must be something to trouble and disturb the stomach that must purge and cure it and here the common rule that thing be cure by their contrary fail for in this one ill be cure by another this belief a little resembles that other so ancient one of think to gratify the god and nature by massacre and murder an opinion universally once receive in all religion and still in these late time wherein our father live amurath at the taking of the isthmus immolate six hundred young greek to hi father soul in the nature of a propitiatory sacrifice for hi sin and in those new country discover in this age of ours which be pure and virgin yet in comparison of ours this practice be in some measure everywhere receive all their idol reek with human blood not without various example of horrid cruelty some they burn alive and take half broil off the coal to tear out their heart and entrails some even woman they flay alive and with their bloody skin clothe and disguise other neither be we without great example of constancy and resolution in this affair the poor soul that be to be sacrifice old men woman and child themselves go about some day before to beg alms for the offering of their sacrifice present themselves to the slaughter singing and dance with the spectator the ambassador of the king of mexico set out to fernando cortez the power and greatness of their master after have tell him that he have thirty vassal of whom each be able to raise an hundred thousand fight men and that he keep hi court in the fairest and best fortify city under the sun add at last that he be oblige yearly to offer to the god fifty thousand men and it be affirm that he maintain a continual war with some potent neighbouring nation not only to keep the young men in exercise but principally to have wherewithal to furnish hi sacrifice with hi prisoner of war at a certain town in another place for the welcome of the say cortez they sacrifice fifty men at once i will tell you this one tale more and i have do some of these people be beat by him send to acknowledge him and to treat with him of a peace whose messenger carry him three sort of gift which they present in these term behold lord here be five slave if thou art a furious god that feedeth upon flesh and blood eat these and we will bring thee more if thou art an affable god behold here incense and feather but if thou art a man take these fowl and these fruit that we have bring thee when king pyrrhus invade italy have view and consider the order of the army the roman send out to meet him i know not say he what kind of barbarian for so the greek call all other nation these may be but the disposition of this army that i see have nothing of barbarism in it a much say the greek of that which flaminius bring into their country and philip beholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the roman camp form in hi kingdom by publius sulpicius galba spake to the same effect by which it appear how cautious men ought to be of take thing upon trust from vulgar opinion and that we be to judge by the eye of reason and not from common report i long have a man in my house that live ten or twelve year in the new world discover in these latter day and in that part of it where villegaignon land which he call antarctic france this discovery of so vast a country seem to be of very great consideration i can not be sure that hereafter there may not be another so many wise men than we have be deceive in this i be afraid our eye be big than our belly and that we have more curiosity than capacity for we grasp at all but catch nothing but wind plato bring in solon tell a story that he have hear from the priest of sais in egypt that of old and before the deluge there be a great island call atlantis situate directly at the mouth of the strait of gibraltar which contain more country than both africa and asia put together and that the king of that country who not only possess that isle but extend their dominion so far into the continent that they have a country of africa as far a egypt and extend in europe to tuscany attempt to encroach even upon asia and to subjugate all the nation that border upon the mediterranean sea as far a the black sea and to that effect overrun all spain the gaul and italy so far a to penetrate into greece where the athenian stop them but that some time after both the athenian and they and their island be swallow by the flood it be very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water make wonderful change and alteration in the habitation of the earth a ti say that the sea then divide sicily from italy cyprus from syria the isle of negropont from the continent of beeotia and elsewhere united land that be separate before by fill up the channel betwixt them with sand and mud but there be no great appearance that this isle be this new world so lately discover for that almost touch upon spain and it be an incredible effect of an inundation to have tumble back so prodigious a mass above twelve hundred league besides that our modern navigator have already almost discover it to be no island but terra firma and continent with the east indie on the one side and with the land under the two pole on the other side or if it be separate from them it be by so narrow a strait and channel that it none the more deserve the name of an island for that it should seem that in this great body there be two sort of motion the one natural and the other febrific a there be in ours when i consider the impression that our river of dordogne have make in my time on the right bank of it descent and that in twenty year it have gain so much and undermine the foundation of so many house i perceive it to be an extraordinary agitation for have it always follow this course or be hereafter to do it the aspect of the world would be totally change but river alter their course sometimes beat against the one side and sometimes the other and some time quietly keep the channel i do not speak of sudden inundation the cause of which everybody understand in medoc by the seashore the sieur darsac my brother see an estate he have there bury under the sand which the sea vomit before it where the top of some house be yet to be see and where hi rent and domain be convert into pitiful barren pasturage the inhabitant of this place affirm that of late year the sea have drive so vehemently upon them that they have lose above four league of land these sand be her harbinger and we now see great heap of move sand that march half a league before her and occupy the land the other testimony from antiquity to which some would apply this discovery of the new world be in aristotle at least if that little book of unheard of miracle be hi he there tell u that certain carthaginian have cross the atlantic sea without the strait of gibraltar and sail a very long time discover at last a great and fruitful island all cover over with wood and water with several broad and deep river far remote from all terra firma and that they and other after them allure by the goodness and fertility of the soil go thither with their wife and child and begin to plant a colony but the senate of carthage perceive their people by little and little to diminish issue out an express prohibition that none upon pain of death should transport themselves thither and also drive out these new inhabitant fear ti say l in process of time they should so multiply a to supplant themselves and ruin their state but this relation of aristotle no more agrees with our newfound land than the other this man that i have be a plain ignorant fellow and therefore the more likely to tell truth for your betterbred sort of men be much more curious in their observation ti true and discover a great deal more but then they gloss upon it and to give the great weight to what they deliver and allure your belief they can not forbear a little to alter the story they never represent thing to you simply a they be but rather a they appear to them or a they would have them appear to you and to gain the reputation of men of judgment and the good to induce your faith be willing to help out the business with something more than be really true of their own invention now in this case we should either have a man of irreproachable veracity or so simple that he have not wherewithal to contrive and to give a colour of truth to false relation and who can have no end in forge an untruth such a one be mine and besides he have at diver time bring to me several seaman and merchant who at the same time go the same voyage i shall therefore content myself with hi information without inquire what the cosmographer say to the business we should have topographers to trace out to u the particular place where they have be but for have have this advantage over u to have see the holy land they would have the privilege forsooth to tell u story of all the other part of the world beside i would have every one write what he know and as much a he know but no more and that not in this only but in all other subject for such a person may have some particular knowledge and experience of the nature of such a river or such a fountain who a to other thing know no more than what everybody do and yet to give a currency to hi little pittance of learn will undertake to write the whole body of physic a vice from which great inconvenience derive their original now to return to my subject i find that there be nothing barbarous and savage in this nation by anything that i can gather except that every one give the title of barbarism to everything that be not in use in hi own country a indeed we have no other level of truth and reason than the example and idea of the opinion and custom of the place wherein we live there be always the perfect religion there the perfect government there the most exact and accomplished usage of all thing they be savage at the same rate that we say fruit be wild which nature produce of herself and by her own ordinary progress whereas in truth we ought rather to call those wild whose nature we have change by our artifice and divert from the common order in those the genuine most useful and natural virtue and property be vigorous and sprightly which we have help to degenerate in these by accommodate them to the pleasure of our own corrupt palate and yet for all this our taste confess a flavour and delicacy excellent even to emulation of the best of ours in several fruit wherein those country abound without art or culture neither be it reasonable that art should gain the preeminence of our great and powerful mother nature we have so surcharge her with the additional ornament and grace we have add to the beauty and rich of her own work by our invention that we have almost smother her yet in other place where she shin in her own purity and proper lustre she marvellously baffle and disgrace all our vain and frivolous attempt our utmost endeavour can not arrive at so much a to imitate the nest of the least of bird it contexture beauty and convenience not so much a the web of a poor spider all thing say plato be produce either by nature by fortune or by art the great and most beautiful by the one or the other of the former the least and the most imperfect by the last these nation then seem to me to be so far barbarous a have receive but very little form and fashion from art and human invention and consequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity the law of nature however govern them still not a yet much vitiate with any mixture of ours but ti in such purity that i be sometimes troubled we be not sooner acquaint with these people and that they be not discover in those good time when there be men much more able to judge of them than we be i be sorry that lycurgus and plato have no knowledge of them for to my apprehension what we now see in those nation do not only surpass all the picture with which the poet have adorn the golden age and all their invention in feign a happy state of man but moreover the fancy and even the wish and desire of philosophy itself so native and so pure a simplicity a we by experience see to be in them could never enter into their imagination nor could they ever believe that human society could have be maintain with so little artifice and human patchwork i should tell plato that it be a nation wherein there be no manner of traffic no knowledge of letter no science of number no name of magistrate or political superiority no use of service rich or poverty no contract no succession no dividend no property no employment but those of leisure no respect of kindred but common no clothing no agriculture no metal no use of corn or wine the very word that signify lie treachery dissimulation avarice envy detraction pardon never hear of how much would he find hi imaginary republic short of hi perfection a to the rest they live in a country very pleasant and temperate so that a my witness inform me ti rare to hear of a sick person and they moreover assure me that they never saw any of the native either paralytic bleareyed toothless or crook with age the situation of their country be along the seashore enclose on the other side towards the land with great and high mountain have about a hundred league in breadth between they have great store of fish and flesh that have no resemblance to those of ours which they eat without any other cookery than plain boil roasting and broil the first that ride a horse thither though in several other voyage he have contract an acquaintance and familiarity with them put them into so terrible a fright with hi centaur appearance that they kill him with their arrow before they could come to discover who he be their building be very long and of capacity to hold two or three hundred people make of the bark of tall tree rear with one end upon the ground and lean to and support one another at the top like some of our barn of which the covering hang down to the very ground and serf for the side wall they have wood so hard that they cut with it and make their sword of it and their grill of it to broil their meat their bed be of cotton hung swing from the roof like our seaman hammock every man hi own for the wife lie apart from their husband they rise with the sun and so soon a they be up eat for all day for they have no more meal but that they do not then drink a suidas report of some other people of the east that never drink at their meal but drink very often all day after and sometimes to a rouse pitch their drink be make of a certain root and be of the colour of our claret and they never drink it but lukewarm it will not keep above two or three day it have a somewhat sharp brisk taste be nothing heady but very comfortable to the stomach laxative to stranger but a very pleasant beverage to such a be accustom to it they make use instead of bread of a certain white compound like coriander seed i have taste of it the taste be sweet and a little flat the whole day be spend in dance their young men go ahunting after wild beast with bow and arrows one part of their woman be employ in prepare their drink the while which be their chief employment one of their old men in the morning before they fall to eat preaches to the whole family walk from the one end of the house to the other and several time repeat the same sentence till he have finish the round for their house be at least a hundred yard long valour towards their enemy and love towards their wife be the two head of hi discourse never fail in the close to put them in mind that tis their wife who provide them their drink warm and well season the fashion of their bed rope sword and of the wooden bracelet they tie about their wrist when they go to fight and of the great cane bore hollow at one end by the sound of which they keep the cadence of their dance be to be see in several place and amongst other at my house they shave all over and much more neatly than we without other razor than one of wood or stone they believe in the immortality of the soul and that those who have merit well of the god be lodge in that part of heaven where the sun rise and the accurse in the west they have i know not what kind of priest and prophet who very rarely present themselves to the people have their abode in the mountain at their arrival there be a great feast and solemn assembly of many village each house a i have describe make a village and they be about a french league distant from one another this prophet declaim to them in public exhort them to virtue and their duty but all their ethic be comprise in these two article resolution in war and affection to their wife he also prophesy to them event to come and the issue they be to expect from their enterprise and prompt them to or divert them from war but let him look tot for if he fail in hi divination and anything happen otherwise than he have foretell he be cut into a thousand piece if he be catch and condemn for a false prophet for that reason if any of them have be mistake he be no more heard of divination be a gift of god and therefore to abuse it ought to be a punishable imposture amongst the scythian where their diviner fail in the promised effect they be lay bound hand and foot upon cart load with fir and bavins and draw by ox on which they be burn to death such a only meddle with thing subject to the conduct of human capacity be excusable in do the best they can but those other fellow that come to delude u with assurance of an extraordinary faculty beyond our understand ought they not to be punish when they do not make good the effect of their promise and for the temerity of their imposture they have continual war with the nation that live far within the mainland beyond their mountain to which they go naked and without other arm than their bow and wooden sword fashion at one end like the head of our javelin the obstinacy of their battle be wonderful and they never end without great effusion of blood for a to run away they know not what it be every one for a trophy bring home the head of an enemy he have kill which he fix over the door of hi house after have a long time treat their prisoner very well and give them all the regales they can think of he to whom the prisoner belong invite a great assembly of hi friend they be come he tie a rope to one of the arm of the prisoner of which at a distance out of hi reach he hold the one end himself and give to the friend he love best the other arm to hold after the same manner which be do they two in the presence of all the assembly despatch him with their sword after that they roast him eat him amongst them and send some chop to their absent friend they do not do this a some think for nourishment a the scythian anciently do but a a representation of an extreme revenge a will appear by this that have observe the portuguese who be in league with their enemy to inflict another sort of death upon any of them they take prisoner which be to set them up to the girdle in the earth to shoot at the remain part till it be stick full of arrow and then to hang them they think those people of the other world a be men who have sow the knowledge of a great many vice amongst their neighbour and who be much great master in all sort of mischief than they do not exercise this sort of revenge without a meaning and that it must needs be more painful than theirs they begin to leave their old way and to follow this i be not sorry that we should here take notice of the barbarous horror of so cruel an action but that see so clearly into their fault we should be so blind to our own i conceive there be more barbarity in eat a man alive than when he be dead in tear a body limb from limb by rack and torment that be yet in perfect sense in roast it by degree in cause it to be bite and worry by dog and swine a we have not only read but lately see not amongst inveterate and mortal enemy but among neighbour and fellowcitizens and which be bad under colour of piety and religion than to roast and eat him after he be dead chrysippus and zeno the two head of the stoic sect be of opinion that there be no hurt in make use of our dead carcass in what way soever for our necessity and in feed upon them too a our own ancestor who be besiege by caesar in the city alexia resolve to sustain the famine of the siege with the body of their old men woman and other person who be incapable of bear arm and the physician make no bone of employ it to all sort of use either to apply it outwardly or to give it inwardly for the health of the patient but there never be any opinion so irregular a to excuse treachery disloyalty tyranny and cruelty which be our familiar vice we may then call these people barbarous in respect to the rule of reason but not in respect to ourselves who in all sort of barbarity exceed them their war be throughout noble and generous and carry a much excuse and fair pretence a that human malady be capable of have with them no other foundation than the sole jealousy of valour their dispute be not for the conquest of new land for these they already posse be so fruitful by nature a to supply them without labour or concern with all thing necessary in such abundance that they have no need to enlarge their border and they be moreover happy in this that they only covet so much a their natural necessity require all beyond that be superfluous to them men of the same age call one another generally brother those who be young child and the old men be father to all these leave to their heir in common the full possession of good without any manner of division or other title than what nature bestow upon her creature in bring them into the world if their neighbour pas over the mountain to assault them and obtain a victory all the victor gain by it be glory only and the advantage of have prove themselves the well in valour and virtue for they never meddle with the good of the conquer but presently return into their own country where they have no want of anything necessary nor of this great of all good to know happily how to enjoy their condition and to be content and those in turn do the same they demand of their prisoner no other ransom than acknowledgment that they be overcome but there be not one found in an age who will not rather choose to die than make such a confession or either by word or look recede from the entire grandeur of an invincible courage there be not a man amongst them who have not rather be kill and eat than so much a to open hi mouth to entreat he may not they use them with all liberality and freedom to the end their life may be so much the dearer to them but frequently entertain them with menace of their approaching death of the torment they be to suffer of the preparation make in order to it of the mangle their limb and of the feast that be to be make where their carcass be to be the only dish all which they do to no other end but only to extort some gentle or submissive word from them or to frighten them so a to make them run away to obtain this advantage that they be terrify and that their constancy be shake and indeed if rightly take it be in this point only that a true victory consist the hungarian a very warlike people never pretend further than to reduce the enemy to their discretion for have force this confession from them they let them go without injury or ransom except at the most to make them engage their word never to bear arm against them again we have sufficient advantage over our enemy that be borrow and not truly our own it be the quality of a porter and no effect of virtue to have strong arm and legs it be a dead and corporeal quality to set in array ti a turn of fortune to make our enemy stumble or to dazzle him with the light of the sun ti a trick of science and art and that may happen in a mean base fellow to be a good fencer the estimate and value of a man consist in the heart and in the will there hi true honour lie valour be stability not of leg and arm but of the courage and the soul it do not lie in the goodness of our horse or our arm but in our own he that fall obstinate in hi courage he who for any danger of imminent death abates nothing of hi assurance who die yet dart at hi enemy a fierce and disdainful look be overcome not by u but by fortune he be kill not conquer the most valiant be sometimes the most unfortunate there be defeat more triumphant than victory never could those four sister victories the fair the sun ever be hold of salami plataea mycale and sicily venture to oppose all their united glory to the single glory of the discomfiture of king leonidas and hi men at the pas of thermopylae who ever run with a more glorious desire and great ambition to the win than captain iscolas to the certain loss of a battle who could have find out a more subtle invention to secure hi safety than he do to assure hi destruction he be set to defend a certain pas of peloponnesus against the arcadian which consider the nature of the place and the inequality of force find it utterly impossible for him to do and see that all who be present to the enemy must certainly be leave upon the place and on the other side repute it unworthy of hi own virtue and magnanimity and of the lacedaemonian name to fail in any part of hi duty he choose a mean betwixt these two extreme after this manner the young and most active of hi men he preserve for the service and defence of their country and send them back and with the rest whose loss would be of less consideration he resolve to make good the pas and with the death of them to make the enemy buy their entry as dear a possibly he could a it fell out for be presently environ on all side by the arcadian after have make a great slaughter of the enemy he and hi be all cut in piece is there any trophy dedicate to the conqueror which be not much more due to these who be overcome the part that true conquering be to play lie in the encounter not in the come off and the honour of valour consist in fight not in subdue but to return to my story these prisoner be so far from discover the least weakness for all the terror that can be represent to them that on the contrary during the two or three month they be kept they always appear with a cheerful countenance importune their master to make haste to bring them to the test defy rail at them and reproach them with cowardice and the number of battle they have lose against those of their country i have a song make by one of these prisoner wherein he bid them come all and dine upon him and welcome for they shall withal eat their own father and grandfather whose flesh have serve to fee and nourish him these muscle say he this flesh and these vein be your own poor silly souls a you be you little think that the substance of your ancestor limbs be here yet notice what you eat and you will find in it the taste of your own flesh in which song there be to be observe an invention that nothing relish of the barbarian those that paint these people die after this manner represent the prisoner spit in the face of hi executioner and make wry mouth at them and tis most certain that to the very last gasp they never cease to brave and defy them both in word and gesture in plain truth these men be very savage in comparison of u of necessity they must either be absolutely so or els we be savage for there be a vast difference betwixt their manner and ours the men there have several wife and so much the great number by how much they have the great reputation for valour and it be one very remarkable feature in their marriage that the same jealousy our wife have to hinder and divert u from the friendship and familiarity of other woman those employ to promote their husband desire and to procure them many spouse for be above all thing solicitous of their husband honour tis their chiefest care to seek out and to bring in the most companion they can forasmuch a it be a testimony of the husband virtue most of our lady will cry out that ti monstrous whereas in truth it be not so but a truly matrimonial virtue and of the high form in the bible sarah with leah and rachel the two wife of jacob give the most beautiful of their handmaid to their husband livia prefer the passion of augustus to her own interest and the wife of king deiotarus stratonice do not only give up a fair young maid that serve her to her husband embrace but moreover carefully bring up the child he have by her and assist them in the succession to their father crown and that it may not be suppose that all this be do by a simple and servile obligation to their common practice or by any authoritative impression of their ancient custom without judgment or reasoning and from have a soul so stupid that it can not contrive what els to do i must here give you some touch of their sufficiency in point of understand besides what i repeat to you before which be one of their song of war i have another a lovesong that begin thus wherein the first couplet stay adder c make the burden of the song now i have converse enough with poetry to judge thus much that not only there be nothing barbarous in this invention but moreover that it be perfectly anacreontic to which it may be add that their language be soft of a pleasing accent and something border upon the greek termination three of these people not foresee how dear their knowledge of the corruption of this part of the world will one day cost their happiness and repose and that the effect of this commerce will be their ruin a i presuppose it be in a very fair way miserable men to suffer themselves to be delude with desire of novelty and to have leave the serenity of their own heaven to come so far to gaze at ours be at rouen at the time that the late king charles ix be there the king himself talk to them a good while and they be make to see our fashion our pomp and the form of a great city after which some one ask their opinion and would know of them what of all the thing they have see they find most to be admire to which they make answer three thing of which i have forget the third and be trouble at it but two i yet remember they say that in the first place they think it very strange that so many tall men wear beard strong and well arm who be about the king ti like they mean the swiss of the guard should submit to obey a child and that they do not rather choose out one amongst themselves to command secondly they have a way of speak in their language to call men the half of one another that they have observe that there be amongst u men full and cram with all manner of commodity whilst in the meantime their half be beg at their door lean and halfstarved with hunger and poverty and they think it strange that these necessitous half be able to suffer so great an inequality and injustice and that they do not take the other by the throat or set fire to their house i talk to one of them a great while together but i have so ill an interpreter and one who be so perplexed by hi own ignorance to apprehend my meaning that i could get nothing out of him of any moment ask him what advantage he reap from the superiority he have amongst hi own people for he be a captain and our mariner call him king he tell me to march at the head of them to war demanding of him further how many men he have to follow him he show me a space of ground to signify as many a could march in such a compass which might be four or five thousand men and put the question to him whether or no hi authority expire with the war he tell me this remain that when he go to visit the village of hi dependence they plan him path through the thick of their wood by which he might pass at hi ease all this do not sound very ill and the last be not at all amiss for they wear no breech the true field and subject of imposture be thing unknown forasmuch a in the first place their very strangeness lend them credit and moreover by not be subject to our ordinary reason they deprive u of the mean to question and dispute them for which reason say plato it be much more easy to satisfy the hearer when speaking of the nature of the god than of the nature of men because the ignorance of the auditory afford a fair and large career and all manner of liberty in the handling of abstruse thing thence it come to pass that nothing be so firmly believe a what we least know nor any people so confident a those who entertain u with fable such a your alchemist judicial astrologer fortuneteller and physician to which i would willingly if i durst join a pack of people that take upon them to interpret and control the design of god himself pretend to find out the cause of every accident and to pry into the secret of the divine will there to discover the incomprehensible motive of hi work and although the variety and the continual discordance of event throw them from corner to corner and toss them from east to west yet do they still persist in their vain inquisition and with the same pencil to paint black and white in a nation of the indie there be this commendable custom that when anything befall them amiss in any encounter or battle they publicly ask pardon of the sun who be their god a have commit an unjust action always impute their good or evil fortune to the divine justice and to that submit their own judgment and reason ti enough for a christian to believe that all thing come from god to receive them with acknowledgment of hi divine and inscrutable wisdom and also thankfully to accept and receive them with what face soever they may present themselves but i do not approve of what i see in use that be to seek to affirm and support our religion by the prosperity of our enterprise our belief have other foundation enough without go about to authorise it by event for the people be accustom to such plausible argument a these and so proper to their taste it be to be fear l when they fail of success they should also stagger in their faith a in the war wherein we be now engage upon the account of religion those who have the well in the business of rochelabeille make great brag of that success a an infallible approbation of their cause when they come afterwards to excuse their misfortune of moncontour and jarnac by say they be fatherly scourge and correction that they have not a people wholly at their mercy they make it manifestly enough appear what it be to take two sort of grist out of the same sack and with the same mouth to blow hot and cold it be good to possess the vulgar with the solid and real foundation of truth twas a fine naval battle that be gain under the command of don john of austria a few month since against the turk but it have also please god at other time to let u see a great victory at our own expense in fine ti a hard matter to reduce divine thing to our balance without waste and lose a great deal of the weight and who would take upon him to give a reason that arius and hi pope leo the principal head of the arian heresy should die at several time of so like and strange death for be withdraw from the disputation by a griping in the bowel they both of them suddenly give up the ghost upon the stool and would aggravate this divine vengeance by the circumstance of the place might as well add the death of heliogabalus who be also slay in a house of office and indeed irenaeus be involve in the same fortune god be please to show u that the good have something els to hope for and the wicked something els to fear than the fortune or misfortune of this world manage and apply these accord to hi own occult will and pleasure and deprive u of the mean foolishly to make thereof our own profit and those people abuse themselves who will pretend to dive into these mystery by the strength of human reason they never give one hit that they do not receive two for it of which st augustine make out a great proof upon hi adversary tis a conflict that be more decided by strength of memory than by the force of reason we be to content ourselves with the light it please the sun to communicate to u by virtue of hi ray and who will lift up hi eye to take in a great let him not think it strange if for the reward of hi presumption he there lose hi sight i have long ago observe most of the opinion of the ancient to concur in this that it be high time to die when there be more ill than good in living and that to preserve life to our own torment and inconvenience be contrary to the very rule of nature a these old law instruct u but to push this contempt of death so far a to employ it to the remove our thought from the honour riches dignity and other favour and good a we call them of fortune a if reason be not sufficient to persuade u to avoid them without add this new injunction i have never see it either command or practise till this passage of seneca fell into my hand who advise lucilius a man of great power and authority about the emperor to alter hi voluptuous and magnificent way of living and to retire himself from this worldly vanity and ambition to some solitary quiet and philosophical life and the other allege some difficulty i be of opinion say he either that thou leave that life of thine or life itself i would indeed advise thee to the gentle way and to untie rather than to break the knot thou hast indiscreetly knit provide that if it be not otherwise to be untied thou resolutely break it there be no man so great a coward that have not rather once fall than to be always fall i should have find this counsel conformable enough to the stoical roughness but it appear the more strange for be borrow from epicurus who write the same thing upon the like occasion to idomeneus and i think i have observe something like it but with christian moderation amongst our own people st hilary bishop of poictiers that famous enemy of the arian heresy be in syria have intelligence thither send him that abra hi only daughter whom he leave at home under the eye and tuition of her mother be seek in marriage by the great nobleman of the country a be a virgin virtuously bring up fair rich and in the flower of her age whereupon he write to her a appear upon record that she should remove her affection from all the pleasure and advantage propose to her for that he have in hi travel find out a much great and more worthy fortune for her a husband of much great power and magnificence who would present her with robe and jewel of inestimable value wherein hi design be to dispossess her of the appetite and use of worldly delight to join her wholly to god but the near and most certain way to this be a he conceive the death of hi daughter he never cease by vow prayer and orison to beg of the almighty that he would please to call her out of this world and to take her to himself a accordingly it come to pass for soon after hi return she die at which he express a singular joy this seem to outdo the other forasmuch a he apply himself to this mean at the outset which they only take subsidiarily and besides it be towards hi only daughter but i will not omit the latter end of this story though it be for my purpose st hilarys wife have understand from him how the death of their daughter be bring about by hi desire and design and how much happy she be to be remove out of this world than to have stay in it conceive so vivid an apprehension of the eternal and heavenly beatitude that she beg of her husband with the extreme importunity to do as much for her and god at their joint request shortly after call her to him it be a death embrace with singular and mutual content may reasonably make u expect she should present u with all sort of face can there be a more express act of justice than this the duc de valentinois have resolve to poison adrian cardinal of corneto with whom pope alexander vi hi father and himself be to sup in the vatican he send before a bottle of poisoned wine and withal strict order to the butler to keep it very safe the pope be come before hi son and call for drink the butler suppose this wine have not be so strictly recommend to hi care but

mouth to mouth affectionately suck in the last blood and remainder of the life of each other my late father a man that have no other advantage than experience and hi own natural part be nevertheless of a very clear judgment formerly tell me that he once have thought of endeavour to introduce this practice that there might be in every city a certain place assign to which such a stood in need of anything might repair and have their business enter by an officer appoint for that purpose a for example i want a chapman to buy my pearl i want one that have pearl to sell such a one want company to go to paris such a one seek a servant of such a quality such a one a master such a one such an artificer some inquiring for one thing some for another every one accord to what he want and doubtless these mutual advertisement would be of no contemptible advantage to the public correspondence and intelligence for there be evermore condition that hunt after one another and for want of know one anothers occasion leave men in very great necessity i have hear to the great shame of the age we live in that in our very sight two most excellent men for learn die so poor that they have scarce bread to put in their mouth lilius gregorius giraldus in italy and sebastianus castalio in germany and i believe there be a thousand men would have invite them into their family with very advantageous condition or have relieve them where they be have they know their want the world be not so generally corrupt but that i know a man that would heartily wish the estate hi ancestor have leave him might be employ so long a it shall please fortune to give him leave to enjoy it to secure rare and remarkable person of any kind whom misfortune sometimes persecute to the last degree from the danger of necessity and at least place them in such a condition that they must be very hard to please if they be not content my father in hi domestic economy have this rule which i know how to commend but by no mean to imitate namely that besides the daybook or memorial of household affair where the small account payment and disbursement which do not require a secretarys hand be enter and which a steward always have in custody he order him whom he employ to write for him to keep a journal and in it to set down all the remarkable occurrence and daily memorial of the history of hi house very pleasant to look over when time begin to wear thing out of memory and very useful sometimes to put u out of doubt when such a thing be begin when end what visitor come and when they go our travel absence marriage and death the reception of good or ill news the change of principal servant and the like an ancient custom which i think it would not be amiss for every one to revive in hi own house and i find i do very foolishly in neglect it whatever i shall say upon this subject i be of necessity to invade some of the bound of custom so careful have she be to shut up all the avenue i be dispute with myself in this shivering season whether the fashion of go naked in those nation lately discover be impose upon them by the hot temperature of the air a we say of the indian and moor or whether it be the original fashion of mankind men of understand forasmuch a all thing under the sun a the holy writ declares be subject to the same law be wont in such consideration a these where we be to distinguish the natural law from those which have be impose by man invention to have recourse to the general polity of the world where there can be nothing counterfeit now all other creature be sufficiently furnish with all thing necessary for the support of their be it be not to be imagine that we only be bring into the world in a defective and indigent condition and in such a state a can not subsist without external aid therefore it be that i believe that a plant tree and animal and all thing that have life be see to be by nature sufficiently clothe and cover to defend them from the injury of weather so be we but a those who by artificial light put out that of day so we by borrow form and fashion have destroy our own and ti plain enough to be see that ti custom only which render that impossible that otherwise be nothing so for of those nation who have no manner of knowledge of clothing some be situate under the same temperature that we be and some in much colder climate and besides our most tender part be always expose to the air a the eye mouth nose and ear and our country labourer like our ancestor in former time go with their breast and belly open had we be bear with a necessity upon u of wear petticoat and breech there be no doubt but nature would have fortify those part she intend should be expose to the fury of the season with a thicker skin a she have do the fingerends and the sol of the foot and why should this seem hard to believe i observe much great distance betwixt my habit and that of one of our country boor than betwixt hi and that of a man who have no other cover but hi skin how many men especially in turkey go naked upon the account of devotion some one ask a beggar whom he saw in hi shirt in the depth of winter a brisk and frolic a he who go muffle up to the ear in furs how he be able to endure to go so why sir he answer you go with your face bare i be all face the italian have a story of the duke of florence fool whom hi master ask how be so thinly clad he be able to support the cold when he himself warmly wrap up a he be be hardly able to do it why reply the fool use my receipt to put on all your clothes you have at once and youll feel no more cold than i king massinissa to an extreme old age could never be prevail upon to go with hi head cover how cold stormy or rainy soever the weather might be which also be report of the emperor severus herodotus tell u that in the battle fight betwixt the egyptian and the persian it be observe both by himself and by other that of those who be leave dead upon the field the head of the egyptian be without comparison harder than those of the persian by reason that the last have go with their head always cover from their infancy first with biggin and then with turban and the other always shave and bare king agesilaus continue to a decrepit age to wear always the same clothes in winter that he do in summer caesar say suetonius march always at the head of hi army for the most part on foot with hi head bare whether it be rain or sunshine and a much be say of hannibal a venetian who have long live in pegu and have lately return thence write that the men and woman of that kingdom though they cover all their other part go always barefoot and ride so too and plato very earnestly advise for the health of the whole body to give the head and the foot no other clothing than what nature have bestow he whom the pole have elect for their king since ours come thence who be indeed one of the great prince of this age never wear any glove and in winter or whatever weather can come never wear other cap abroad than that he wear at home whereas i can not endure to go unbuttoned or untied my neighbouring labourer would think themselves in chain if they be so braced varro be of opinion that when it be ordain we should be bare in the presence of the god and before the magistrate it be so ordered rather upon the score of health and to inure u to the injury of weather than upon the account of reverence and since we be now talk of cold and frenchman use to wear variety of colour not i myself for i seldom wear other than black or white in imitation of my father let u add another story out of le capitaine martin du bellay who affirm that in the march to luxembourg he saw so great frost that the munitionwine be cut with hatchet and wedge and deliver out to the soldier by weight and that they carry it away in basket and ovid at the mouth of lake maeotis the frost be so very sharp that in the very same place where mithridates lieutenant have fight the enemy dryfoot and give them a notable defeat the summer follow he obtain over them a naval victory the roman fought at a very great disadvantage in the engagement they have with the carthaginian near piacenza by reason that they go to the charge with their blood congeal and their limb numb with cold whereas hannibal have cause great fire to be disperse quite through hi camp to warm hi soldier and oil to be

certain form i do not oblige other to it a many do but believe and apprehend a thousand way of living and contrary to most men more easily admit of difference than uniformity amongst u i as frankly a any one would have me discharge a man from my humour and principle and consider him accord to hi own particular model though i be not continent myself i nevertheless sincerely approve the continence of the feuillans and capuchin and highly commend their way of living i insinuate myself by imagination into their place and love and honour them the more for be other than i be i very much desire that we may be judge every man by himself and would not be draw into the consequence of common example my own weakness nothing alter the esteem i ought to have for the force and vigour of those who deserve it crawling upon the slime of the earth i do not for all that cease to observe up in the cloud the inimitable height of some heroic souls ti a great deal for me to have my judgment regular and just if the effect can not be so and to maintain this sovereign part at least free from corruption ti something to have my will right and good where my legs fail me this age wherein we live in our part of the world at least be grow so stupid that not only the exercise but the very imagination of virtue be defective and seem to be no other but college jargon ti a gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue a on the tip of the ear for ornament only there be no longer virtuous action extant those action that carry a show of virtue have yet nothing of it essence by reason that profit glory fear custom and other suchlike foreign cause put u on the way to produce them our justice also valour courtesy may be call so too in respect to other and accord to the face they appear with to the public but in the doer it can by no mean be virtue because there be another end propose another move cause now virtue own nothing to be hers but what be do by herself and for herself alone in that great battle of plataea that the greek under the command of pausanias gain against mardonius and the persian the conqueror accord to their custom come to divide amongst them the glory of the exploit attribute to the spartan nation the preeminence of valour in the engagement the spartan great judge of virtue when they come to determine to what particular man of their nation the honour be due of have the best behave himself upon this occasion find that aristodemus have of all other hazard hi person with the great bravery but do not however allow him any prize by reason that hi virtue have be incite by a desire to clear hi reputation from the reproach of hi miscarriage at the business of thermopylae and to die bravely to wipe off that former blemish our judgment be yet sick and obey the humour of our depraved manner i observe most of the wit of these time pretend to ingenuity by endeavour to blemish and darken the glory of the brave and most generous action of former age put one vile interpretation or another upon them and forge and suppose vain cause and motif for the noble thing they do a mighty subtlety indeed give me the great and most unblemished action that ever the day behold and i will contrive a hundred plausible drift and end to obscure it god know whoever will stretch them out to the full what diversity of image our internal will suffer under they do not so maliciously play the censurers a they do it ignorantly and rudely in all their detraction the same pain and licence that other take to blemish and bespatter these illustrious name i would willingly undergo to lend them a shoulder to raise them high these rare form that be cull out by the consent of the wise men of all age for the world example i should not stick to augment in honour as far a my invention would permit in all the circumstance of favourable interpretation and we may well believe that the force of our invention be infinitely short of their merit ti the duty of good men to portray virtue as beautiful a they can and there would be nothing wrong should our passion a little transport u in favour of so sacred a form what these people do on the contrary they either do out of malice or by the vice of confine their belief to their own capacity or which i be more inclined to think for not have their sight strong clear and elevate enough to conceive the splendour of virtue in her native purity a plutarch complain that in hi time some attribute the cause of the young catos death to hi fear of caesar at which he seem very angry and with good reason and by this a man may guess how much more he would have be offend with those who have attribute it to ambition senseless people he would rather have perform a noble just and generous action and to have have ignominy for hi reward than for glory that man be in truth a pattern that nature choose out to show to what height human virtue and constancy could arrive but i be not capable of handle so rich an argument and shall therefore only set five latin poet together contend in the praise of cato and incidentally for their own too now a welleducated child will judge the two first in comparison of the other a little flat and languid the third more vigorous but overthrown by the extravagance of hi own force he will then think that there will be room for one or two gradation of invention to come to the fourth and mount to the pitch of that he will lift up hi hand in admiration come to the last the first by some space but a space that he will swear be not to be fill up by any human wit he will be astound he will not know where he be and here be a wonder we have far more poet than judge and interpreter of poetry it be easy to write it than to understand it there be indeed a certain low and moderate sort of poetry that a man may well enough judge by certain rule of art but the true supreme and divine poesy be above all rule and reason and whoever discern the beauty of it with the most assured and most steady sight see no more than the quick reflection of a flash of lightning it do not exercise but ravishes and overwhelm our judgment the fury that possess him who be able to penetrate into it wound yet a third man by hear him repeat it like a loadstone that not only attract the needle but also infuse into it the virtue to attract other and it be more evidently manifest in our theatre that the sacred inspiration of the mus have first stir up the poet to anger sorrow hatred and out of himself to whatever they will do moreover by the poet posse the actor and by the actor consecutively all the spectator so much do our passion hang and depend upon one another poetry have ever have that power over me from a child to transpierce and transport me but this vivid sentiment that be natural to me have be variously handle by variety of form not so much high or low for they be ever the high of every kind a differing in colour first a gay and sprightly fluency afterwards a lofty and penetrate subtlety and lastly a mature and constant vigour their name will better express them ovid lucan virgil but our poet be begin their career say one say the second and the third speaking of the civil war betwixt caesar and pompey and the fourth upon the praise of caesar and the master of the choir after have set forth all the great name of the great roman end thus when we read in history that antigonus be very much displease with hi son for present him the head of king pyrrhus hi enemy but newly slay fight against him and that see it he weep and that rene duke of lorraine also lament the death of charles duke of burgundy whom he have himself defeat and appear in mourn at hi funeral and that in the battle of dauray which count montfort obtain over charles de blois hi competitor for the duchy of brittany the conqueror meet the dead body of hi enemy be very much afflict at hi death we must not presently cry out when pompey head be present to caesar the history tell u that he turn away hi face a from a sad and unpleasing object there have be so long an intelligence and society betwixt them in the management of the public affair so great a community of fortune so many mutual office and so near an alliance that this countenance of hi ought not to suffer under any misinterpretation or to be suspect for either false or counterfeit a this other seem to believe for though it be true that the great part of our action be no other than visor and disguise and that it may sometimes be true that yet in judging of these accident we be to consider how much our soul be oftentimes agitate with diver passion and a they say that in our body there be a congregation of diver humour of which that be the sovereign which accord to the complexion we be of be commonly most predominant in u so though the soul have in it divers motion to give it agitation yet must there of necessity be one to overrule all the rest though not with so necessary and absolute a dominion but that through the flexibility and inconstancy of the soul those of less authority may upon occasion reassume their place and make a little sally in turn thence it be that we see not only child who innocently obey and follow nature often laugh and cry at the same thing but not one of u can boast what journey soever he may have in hand that he have the most set hi heart upon but when he come to part with hi family and friends he will find something that trouble him within and though he refrain hi tear yet he put foot in the stirrup with a sad and cloudy countenance and what gentle flame soever may warm the heart of modest and wellborn virgin yet be they fain to be force from about their mother neck to be put to bed to their husband whatever this boon companion be pleased to say neither be it strange to lament a person dead whom a man would by no mean should be alive when i rattle my man i do it with all the mettle i have and load him with no feign but downright real curse but the heat be over if he should stand in need of me i should be very ready to do him good for i instantly turn the leaf when i call him calf and coxcomb i do not pretend to entail those title upon him for ever neither do i think i give myself the lie in call him an honest fellow presently after no one quality engross u purely and universally were it not the sign of a fool to talk to one self there would hardly be a day or hour wherein i might not be hear to grumble and mutter to myself and against myself confound the fool and yet i do not think that to be my definition who for see me one while cold and presently very fond towards my wife believe the one or the other to be counterfeit be an as nero take leave of hi mother whom he be send to be drown be nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this farewell and be strike with horror and pity ti say that the light of the sun be not one continuous thing but that he dart new ray so thick one upon another that we can not perceive the intermission just so the soul variously and imperceptibly dart out her passion artabanus come by surprise once upon hi nephew xerxes chide him for the sudden alteration of hi countenance he be consider the immeasurable greatness of hi force pass over the hellespont for the grecian expedition he be first seize with a palpitation of joy to see so many million of men under hi command and this appear in the gaiety of hi look but hi thought at the same instant suggesting to him that of so many life within a century at most there would not be one left he presently knit hi brow and grow sad even to tear we have resolutely pursue the revenge of an injury receive and be sensible of a singular contentment for the victory but we shall weep notwithstanding ti not for the victory though that we shall weep there be nothing alter in that but the soul look upon thing with another eye and represent them to itself with another kind of face for everything have many face and several aspect relation old acquaintance and friendship possess our imagination and make them tender for the time accord to their condition but the turn be so quick that ti go in a moment and therefore if we would make one continued thing of all this succession of passion we deceive ourselves when timoleon lament the murder he have commit upon so mature and generous deliberation he do not lament the liberty restore to hi country he do not lament the tyrant but he lament hi brother one part of hi duty be perform let u give him leave to perform the other let u pretermit that long comparison betwixt the active and the solitary life and a for the fine saying with which ambition and avarice palliate their vice that we be not bear for ourselves but for the public let u boldly appeal to those who be in public affair let them lay their hand upon their heart and then say whether on the contrary they do not rather aspire to title and office and that tumult of the world to make their private advantage at the public expense the corrupt way by which in this our time they arrive at the height to which their ambition aspire manifestly enough declares that their end can not be very good let u tell ambition that it be she herself who give u a taste of solitude for what do she so much avoid a society what do she so much seek a elbowroom a man many do well or ill everywhere but if what bias say be true that the great part be the bad part or what the preacher say there be not one good of a thousand the contagion be very dangerous in the crowd a man must either imitate the vicious or hate them both be dangerous thing either to resemble them because they be many or to hate many because they be unresembling to ourselves merchant who go to sea be in the right when they be cautious that those who embark with them in the same bottom be neither dissolute blasphemer nor vicious other way look upon such society a unfortunate and therefore it be that bias pleasantly say to some who be with him in a dangerous storm implore the assistance of the god peace speak softly say he that they may not know you be here in my company and of more pressing example albuquerque viceroy in the indie for emmanuel king of portugal in an extreme peril of shipwreck take a young boy upon hi shoulder for this only end that in the society of their common danger hi innocence might serve to protect him and to recommend him to the divine favour that they might get safe to shore ti not that a wise man may not live everywhere content and be alone in the very crowd of a palace but if it be leave to hi own choice the schoolman will tell you that he should fly the very sight of the crowd he will endure it if need be but if it be refer to him he will choose to be alone he can not think himself sufficiently rid of vice if he must yet contend with it in other men charondas punish those a evil men who be convict of keep ill company there be nothing so unsociable and sociable a man the one by hi vice the other by hi nature and antisthenes in my opinion do not give him a satisfactory answer who reproach him with frequent ill company by say that the physician live well enough amongst the sick for if they contribute to the health of the sick no doubt but by the contagion continual sight of and familiarity with disease they must of necessity impair their own now the end i take it be all one to live at more leisure and at one ease but men do not always take the right way they often think they have totally take leave of all business when they have only exchange one employment for another there be little less trouble in govern a private family than a whole kingdom wherever the mind be perplex it be in an entire disorder and domestic employment be not less troublesome for be less important moreover for have shake off the court and the exchange we have not take leave of the principal vexation of life ambition avarice irresolution fear and inordinate desire do not leave u because we forsake our native country they often follow u even to cloister and philosophical school nor desert nor cave hairshirts nor fast can disengage u from them one tell socrates that such a one be nothing improve by hi travel i very well believe it say he for he take himself along with him if a man do not first discharge both himself and hi mind of the burden with which he find himself oppress motion will but make it press the harder and sit the heavy a the lading of a ship be of less encumbrance when fast and bestow in a settled posture you do a sick man more harm than good in remove him from place to place you fix and establish the disease by motion a stake sink deep and more firmly into the earth by be move up and down in the place where they be design to stand therefore it be not enough to get remote from the public ti not enough to shift the soil only a man must flee from the popular condition that have take possession of hi soul he must sequester and come again to himself we still carry our fetter along with u ti not an absolute liberty we yet cast back a look upon what we have leave behind u the fancy be still full of it our disease lie in the mind which can not escape from itself and therefore be to be call home and confine within itself that be the true solitude and that may be enjoy even in populous city and the court of king though more commodiously apart now since we will attempt to live alone and to waive all manner of conversation amongst them let u so order it that our content may depend wholly upon ourselves let u dissolve all obligation that ally u to other let u obtain this from ourselves that we may live alone in good earnest and live at our ease too stilpo have escape from the burning of hi town where he lose wife child and good demetrius poliorcetes see him in so great a ruin of hi country appear with an undisturbed countenance ask him if he have receive no loss to which he make answer no and that thank god nothing be lose of hi this also be the meaning of the philosopher antisthenes when he pleasantly say that men should furnish themselves with such thing a would float and might with the owner escape the storm and certainly a wise man never lose anything if he have himself when the city of nola be ruin by the barbarian paulinus who be bishop of that place have there lose all he have himself a prisoner pray after this manner o lord defend me from be sensible of this loss for thou knowest they have yet touch nothing of that which be mine the rich that make him rich and the good that make him good be still keep entire this it be to make choice of treasure that can secure themselves from plunder and violence and to hide them in such a place into which no one can enter and that be not to be betray by any but ourselves wife child and good must be have and especially health by him that can get it but we be not so to set our heart upon them that our happiness must have it dependence upon them we must reserve a backshop wholly our own and entirely free wherein to settle our true liberty our principal solitude and retreat and in this we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves and so privately that no exotic knowledge or communication be admit there there to laugh and to talk a if without wife child good train or attendance to the end that when it shall so fall out that we must lose any or all of these it may be no new thing to be without them we have a mind pliable in itself that will be company that have wherewithal to attack and to defend to receive and to give let u not then fear in this solitude to languish under an uncomfortable vacuity virtue be satisfy with herself without discipline without word without effect in our ordinary action there be not one of a thousand that concern ourselves he that thou seest scramble up the ruin of that wall furious and transport against whom so many harquebussshots be level and that other all over scar pale and faint with hunger and yet resolve rather to die than to open the gate to him dost thou think that these men be there upon their own account no peradventure in the behalf of one whom they never saw and who never concern himself for their pain and danger but lie wallow the while in sloth and pleasure this other slaver bleareyed slovenly fellow that thou seest come out of hi study after midnight dost thou think he have be tumble over book to learn how to become a good man wiser and more content no such matter he will there end hi day but he will teach posterity the measure of plautus verse and the true orthography of a latin word who be it that do not voluntarily exchange hi health hi repose and hi very life for reputation and glory the most useless frivolous and false coin that pass current amongst u our own death do not sufficiently terrify and trouble u let u moreover charge ourselves with those of our wife child and family our own affair do not afford u anxiety enough let u undertake those of our neighbour and friend still more to break our brain and torment u solitude seem to me to wear the best favour in such a have already employ their most active and flourishing age in the world service after the example of thales we have live enough for other let u at least live out the small remnant of life for ourselves let u now call in our thought and intention to ourselves and to our own ease and repose ti no light thing to make a sure retreat it will be enough for u to do without mix other enterprise since god give u leisure to order our removal let u make ready truss our baggage take leave betimes of the company and disentangle ourselves from those violent importunity that engage u elsewhere and separate u from ourselves we must break the knot of our obligation how strong soever and hereafter love this or that but espouse nothing but ourselves that be to say let the remainder be our own but not so joined and so close a not to be force away without flay u or tear out part of our whole the great thing in the world be for a man to know that he be hi own ti time to wean ourselves from society when we can no longer add anything to it he who be not in a condition to lend must forbid himself to borrow our force begin to fail u let u call them in and concentrate them in and for ourselves he that can cast off within himself and resolve the office of friendship and company let him do it in this decay of nature which render him useless burdensome and importunate to other let him take care not to be useless burdensome and importunate to himself let him soothe and caress himself and above all thing be sure to govern himself with reverence to hi reason and conscience to that degree a to be ashamed to make a false step in their presence socrates say that boy be to cause themselves to be instruct men to exercise themselves in welldoing and old men to retire from all civil and military employment live at their own discretion without the obligation to any office there be some complexion more proper for these precept of retirement than other such a be of a soft and dull apprehension and of a tender will and affection not readily to be subdue or employ whereof i be one both by natural condition and by reflection will sooner incline to this advice than active and busy soul which embrace all engage in all be hot upon everything which offer present and give themselves up to every occasion we be to use these accidental and extraneous commodity so far a they be pleasant to u but by no mean to lay our principal foundation there tis no true one neither nature nor reason allow it so to be why therefore should we contrary to their law enslave our own contentment to the power of another to anticipate also the accident of fortune to deprive ourselves of the convenience we have in our own power a several have do upon the account of devotion and some philosopher by reason to be one own servant to lie hard to put out our own eye to throw our wealth into the river to go in search of grief these by the misery of this life aim at bliss in another those by lay themselves low to avoid the danger of fall all such be act of an excessive virtue the stout and most resolute nature render even their seclusion glorious and exemplary a great deal less would serve my turn well enough ti enough for me under fortune favour to prepare myself for her disgrace and be at my ease to represent to myself as far a my imagination can stretch the ill to come a we do at joust and tiltings where we counterfeit war in the great calm of peace i do not think arcesilaus the philosopher the less temperate and virtuous for know that he make use of gold and silver vessel when the condition of hi fortune allow him so to do i have indeed a good opinion of him than if he have deny himself what he use with liberality and moderation i see the utmost limit of natural necessity and consider a poor man beg at my door ofttimes more jocund and more healthy than i myself be i put myself into hi place and attempt to dress my mind after hi mode and run in like manner over other example though i fancy death poverty contempt and sickness treading on my heel i easily resolve not to be affright forasmuch a a less than i take them with so much patience and be not willing to believe that a less understanding can do more than a great or that the effect of precept can not arrive to a great a height a those of custom and knowing of how uncertain duration these accidental convenience be i never forget in the height of all my enjoyment to make it my chief prayer to almighty god that he will please to render me content with myself and the condition wherein i be i see young men very gay and frolic who nevertheless keep a mass of pill in their trunk at home to take when theyve get a cold which they fear so much the less because they think they have remedy at hand every one should do in like manner and moreover if they find themselves subject to some more violent disease should furnish themselves with such medicine a may numb and stupefy the part the employment a man should choose for such a life ought neither to be a laborious nor an unpleasing one otherwise ti to no purpose at all to be retire and this depend upon every one like and humour mine have no manner of complacency for husbandry and such a love it ought to apply themselves to it with moderation husbandry be otherwise a very servile employment a sallust call it though some part of it be more excusable than the rest a the care of garden which xenophon attribute to cyrus and a mean may be find out betwixt the sordid and low application so full of perpetual solicitude which be see in men who make it their entire business and study and the stupid and extreme negligence let all thing go at random which we see in other but let u hear what advice the young pliny give hi friend caninius rufus upon the subject of solitude i advise thee in the full and plentiful retirement wherein thou art to leave to thy hinds the care of thy husbandry and to addict thyself to the study of letter to extract from thence something that may be entirely and absolutely thine own by which he mean reputation like cicero who say that he would employ hi solitude and retirement from public affair to acquire by hi writing an immortal life it appear to be reason when a man talk of retire from the world that he should look quite out of himself these do it but by half they design well enough for themselves when they shall be no more in it but still they pretend to extract the fruit of that design from the world when absent from it by a ridiculous contradiction the imagination of those who seek solitude upon the account of devotion fill their hope and courage with certainty of divine promise in the other life be much more rationally found they propose to themselves god an infinite object in goodness and power the soul have there wherewithal at full liberty to satiate her desire affliction and suffering turn to their advantage be undergone for the acquisition of eternal health and joy death be to be wish and long for where it be the passage to so perfect a condition the asperity of the rule they impose upon themselves be immediately soften by custom and all their carnal appetite baffle and subdue by refuse to humour and fee them these be only support by use and exercise this sole end of another happily immortal life be that which really merit that we should abandon the pleasure and convenience of this and he who can really and constantly inflame hi soul with the ardour of this vivid faith and hope erects for himself in solitude a more voluptuous and delicious life than any other sort of existence neither the end then nor the mean of this advice please me for we often fall out of the fryingpan into the fire this bookemployment be as painful a any other and a great an enemy to health which ought to be the first thing consider neither ought a man to be allure with the pleasure of it which be the same that destroy the frugal the avaricious the voluptuous and the ambitious man the sage give u caution enough to beware the treachery of our desire and to distinguish true and entire pleasure from such a be mixed and complicate with great pain for the most of our pleasure say they wheedle and caress only to strangle u like those thief the egyptian call philistae if the headache should come before drunkenness we should have a care of drink too much but pleasure to deceive u march before and conceals her train book be pleasant but if by be overstudious we impair our health and spoil our goodhumour the best piece we have let u give it over i for my part be one of those who think that no fruit derive from them can recompense so great a loss a men who have long felt themselves weaken by indisposition give themselves up at last to the mercy of medicine and submit to certain rule of live which they be for the future never to transgress so he who retire weary of and disgust with the common way of living ought to model this new one he enter into by the rule of reason and to institute and establish it by premeditation and reflection he ought to have take leave of all sort of labour what advantage soever it may promise and generally to have shake off all those passion which disturb the tranquillity of body and soul and then choose the way that best suit with hi own humour in husbandry study hunting and all other exercise men be to proceed to the utmost limit of pleasure but must take heed of engage further where trouble begin to mix with it we be to reserve so much employment only as be necessary to keep u in breath and to defend u from the inconvenience that the other extreme of a dull and stupid laziness brings along with it there be sterile knotty science chiefly hammer out for the crowd let such be leave to them who be engage in the world service i for my part care for no other book but either such a be pleasant and easy to amuse me or those that comfort and instruct me how to regulate my life and death wiser men have great force and vigour of soul may propose to themselves a rest wholly spiritual but for me who have a very ordinary soul it be very necessary to support myself with bodily convenience and age have of late deprive me of those pleasure that be more acceptable to me i instruct and whet my appetite to those that remain more suitable to this other reason we ought to hold with all our force both of hand and teeth the use of the pleasure of life that our year one after another snatch away from u now a to the end that pliny and cicero propose to u of glory ti infinitely wide of my account ambition be of all other the most contrary humour to solitude glory and repose be thing that can not possibly inhabit in one and the same place for so much a i understand these have only their arm and leg disengage from the crowd their soul and intention remain confine behind more than ever they have only retire to take a good leap and by a strong motion to give a brisker charge into the crowd will you see how they shoot short let u put into the counterpoise the advice of two philosopher of two very different sect write the one to idomeneus the other to lucilius their friend to retire into solitude from worldly honour and affair you have say they hitherto live swimming and float come now and die in the harbour you have give the first part of your life to the light give what remain to the shade it be impossible to give over business if you do not also quit the fruit therefore disengage yourselves from all concern of name and glory ti to be fear the lustre of your former action will give you but too much light and follow you into your most private retreat quit with other pleasure that which proceed from the approbation of another man and a to your knowledge and part never concern yourselves they will not lose their effect if yourselves be the good for them remember him who be ask why he take so much pain in an art that could come to the knowledge of but few person a few be enough for me reply he i have enough with one i have enough with never an one he say true you and a companion be theatre enough to one another or you to yourself let the people be to you one and be you one to the whole people ti an unworthy ambition to think to derive glory from a man sloth and privacy you be to do like the beast of chase who efface the track at the entrance into their den you be no more to concern yourself how the world talk of you but how you be to talk to yourself retire yourself into yourself but first prepare yourself there to receive yourself it be a folly to trust yourself in your own hand if you can not govern yourself a man may miscarry alone as well a in company till you have render yourself one before whom you dare not trip and till you have a bashfulness and respect for yourself present continually to your imagination cato phocion and aristides in whose presence the fools themselves will hide their fault and make them controller of all your intention should these deviate from virtue your respect to those will set you right they will keep you in this way to be content with yourself to borrow nothing of any other but yourself to stay and fix your soul in certain and limited thought wherein she may please herself and have understood the true and real good which men the more enjoy the more they understand to rest satisfy without desire of prolongation of life or name this be the precept of the true and natural philosophy not of a boasting and prate philosophy such a that of the two former one word more by way of comparison betwixt these two there be to be gather out of the writing of cicero and the young pliny but little in my opinion resemble hi uncle in hi humour infinite testimony of a beyond measure ambitious nature and amongst other this for one that they both in the sight of all the world solicit the historian of their time not to forget them in their memoir and fortune a if in spite have make the vanity of those request live upon record down to this age of ours while she have long since consign the history themselves to oblivion but this exceed all meanness of spirit in person of such a quality a they be to think to derive any great renown from babble and prate even to the publishing of their private letter to their friend and so withal that though some of them be never send the opportunity be lose they nevertheless present them to the light with this worthy excuse that they be unwilling to lose their labour and lucubration be it not very well become two consul of rome sovereign magistrate of the republic that command the world to spend their leisure in contrive quaint and elegant missive thence to gain the reputation of be verse in their own mothertongues what could a pitiful schoolmaster have do bad whose trade it be thereby to get hi living if the act of xenophon and caesar have not far transcend their eloquence i scarce believe they would ever have take the pain to have write them they make it their business to recommend not their speaking but their do and could the perfection of eloquence have add a lustre suitable to a great personage certainly scipio and laelius have never resign the honour of their comedy with all the luxuriance and elegance of the latin tongue to an african slave for that the work be theirs it beauty and excellence sufficiently declare terence himself confess as much and i should take it ill from any one that would dispossess me of that belief tis a kind of mockery and offence to extol a man for quality misbecoming hi condition though otherwise commendable in themselves but such a ought not however to be hi chief talent a if a man should commend a king for be a good painter a good architect a good marksman or a good runner at the ring commendation that add no honour unless mention altogether and in the train of those that be properly applicable to him namely justice and the science of govern and conduct hi people both in peace and war at this rate agriculture be an honour to cyrus and eloquence and the knowledge of letter to charlemagne i have in my time know some who by write acquire both their title and fortune disown their apprenticeshipcorrupt their style and affect ignorance in so vulgar a quality which also our nation hold to be rarely see in very learned hand and to seek a reputation by good quality demosthenes companion in the embassy to philip extol that prince a handsome eloquent and a stout drinker demosthenes say that those be commendation more proper for a woman an advocate or a sponge than for a king ti not hi profession to know either how to hunt or to dance well plutarch say moreover that to appear so excellent in these less necessary quality be to produce witness against a man self that he have spend hi time and apply hi study ill which ought to have be employ in the acquisition of more necessary and more useful thing so that philip king of macedon have heard that great alexander hi son sing once at a feast to the wonder of the best musician there art thou not ashamed say he to him to sing so well and to the same philip a musician with whom he be dispute about some thing concern hi art heaven forbid sir say he that so great a misfortune should ever befall you a to understand these thing good than i a king should be able to answer a iphicrates do the orator who press upon him in hi invective after this manner and what art thou that thou bravest it at this rate art thou a man at arm art thou an archer art thou a pikemani be none of all this but i know how to command all these and antisthenes take it for an argument of little value in ismenias that he be commend for play excellently well upon a flute i know very well that when i hear any one dwell upon the language of my essay i have rather a great deal he would say nothing ti not so much to elevate the style a to depress the sense and so much the more offensively a they do it obliquely and yet i be much deceive if many other writer deliver more worth note a to the matter and how well or ill soever if any other writer have sow thing much more material or at all event more downright upon hi paper than myself to bring the more in i only muster up the head should i annex the sequel i should trebly multiply the volume and how many story have i scatter up and down in this book that i only touch upon which should any one more curiously search into they would find matter enough to produce infinite essay neither those story nor my quotation always serve simply for example authority or ornament i do not only regard them for the use i make of them they carry sometimes besides what i apply them to the seed of a more rich and a bolder matter and sometimes collaterally a more delicate sound both to myself who will say no more about it in this place and to other who shall be of my humour but return to the speaking virtue i find no great choice betwixt not know to speak anything but ill and not know to speak anything but well the sage tell u that a to what concern knowledge ti nothing but philosophy and a to what concern effect nothing but virtue which be generally proper to all degree and to all order there be something like this in these two other philosopher for they also promise eternity to the letter they write to their friend but ti after another manner and by accommodate themselves for a good end to the vanity of another for they write to them that if the concern of make themselves know to future age and the thirst of glory do yet detain them in the management of public affair and make them fear the solitude and retirement to which they would persuade them let them never trouble themselves more about it forasmuch a they shall have credit enough with posterity to ensure them that be there nothing els but the letter thus write to them those letter will render their name a know and famous a their own public action could do and besides this difference these be not idle and empty letter that contain nothing but a fine jingle of wellchosen word and delicate couched phrase but rather replete and abound with grand discourse of reason by which a man may render himself not more eloquent but more wise and that instruct u not to speak but to do well away with that eloquence that enchant u with itself and not with actual thing unless you will allow that of cicero to be of so supreme a perfection a to form a complete body of itself i shall far add one story we read of him to this purpose wherein hi nature will much more manifestly be lay open to u he be to make an oration in public and find himself a little straitened for time to make himself ready at hi ease when eros one of hi slave bring him word that the audience be defer till the next day at which he be so ravished with joy that he enfranchise him for the good news upon this subject of letter i will add this more to what have be already say that it be a kind of write wherein my friend think i can do something and i be willing to confess i should rather have choose to publish my whimsy that way than any other have i have to whom to write but i want such a settled intercourse a i once have to attract me to it to raise my fancy and to support me for to traffic with the wind a some other have do and to forge vain name to direct my letter to in a serious subject i could never do it but in a dream be a swear enemy to all manner of falsification i should have be more diligent and more confident have i have a judicious and indulgent friend whom to address than thus to expose myself to the various judgment of a whole people and i be deceived if i have not succeed well i have naturally a humorous and familiar style but it be a style of my own not proper for public business but like the language i speak too compact irregular abrupt and singular and a to letter of ceremony that have no other substance than a fine contexture of courteous word i be wholly to seek i have neither faculty nor relish for those tedious tender of service and affection i believe little in them from other and i should not forgive myself should i say to other more than i myself believe ti doubtless very remote from the present practice for there never be so abject and servile prostitution of offer life soul devotion adoration vassal slave and i can not tell what a now all which expression be so commonly and so indifferently post to and fro by every one and to every one that when they would profess a great and more respectful inclination upon more just occasion they have not wherewithal to express it i mortally hate all air of flattery which be the cause that i naturally fall into a shy rough and crude way of speak that to such a do not know me may seem a little to relish of disdain i honour those most to whom i show the least honour and where my soul move with the great cheerfulness i easily forget the ceremony of look and gesture and offer myself faintly and bluntly to them to whom i be the most devoted methinks they should read it in my heart and that the expression of my word do but injure the love i have conceive within to welcome take leave give thanks accost offer my service and such verbal formality a the ceremonious law of our modern civility enjoin i know no man so stupidly unprovided of language a myself and i have never be employ in write letter of favour and recommendation that he in whose behalf it be write do not think my mediation cold and imperfect the italian be great printer of letter i do believe i have at least an hundred several volume of them of all which those of annibale caro seem to me to be the best if all the paper i have scribble to the lady at the time when my hand be really prompt by my passion be now in be there might peradventure be find a page worthy to be communicate to our young inamorato that be besotted with that fury i always write my letter posthasteso precipitately that though i write intolerably ill i rather choose to do it myself than to employ another for i can find none able to follow me and i never transcribe any i have accustom the great one who know me to endure my blot and dash and upon paper without fold or margin those that cost me the most pain be the bad when i once begin to draw it in by head and shoulder tis a sign that i be not there i fall too without premeditation or design the first word beget the second and so to the end of the chapter the letter of this age consist more in fine edge and preface than in matter just a i have rather write two letter than close and fold up one and always assign that employment to some other so when the real business of my letter be dispatch i would with all my heart transfer it to another hand to add those long harangue offer and prayer that we place at the bottom and should be glad that some new custom would discharge u of that trouble a also of superscribe them with a long legend of quality and title which for fear of mistake i have often not write at all and especially to men of the long robe and finance there be so many new office such a dispensation and ordering of title of honour that tis hard to set them forth aright yet be so dearly buy they be neither to be alter nor forget without offence i find it equally in bad taste to encumber the front and inscription of the book we commit to the press with such men say an ancient greek sentence be torment with the opinion they have of thing and not by the thing themselves it be a great victory obtain for the relief of our miserable human condition could this proposition be establish for certain and true throughout for if evil have no admission into u but by the judgment we ourselves make of them it should seem that it be then in our own power to despise them or to turn them to good if thing surrender themselves to our mercy why do we not convert and accommodate them to our advantage if what we call evil and torment be neither evil nor torment of itself but only that our fancy give it that quality it be in u to change it and it be in our own choice if there be no constraint upon u we must certainly be very strange fool to take arm for that side which be most offensive to u and to give sickness want and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste if it be in our power to give them a pleasant relish and if fortune simply provide the matter ti for u to give it the form now that what we call evil be not so of itself or at least to that degree that we make it and that it depend upon u to give it another taste and complexion for all come to one let u examine how that can be maintain if the original be of those thing we fear have power to lodge itself in u by it own authority it would then lodge itself alike and in like manner in all for men be all of the same kind and saving in great and less proportion be all provide with the same utensils and instrument to conceive and to judge but the diversity of opinion we have of those thing clearly evidence that they only enter u by composition one person peradventure admit them in their true be but a thousand other give them a new and contrary be in them we hold death poverty and pain for our principal enemy now this death which some repute the most dreadful of all dreadful thing who do not know that other call it the only secure harbour from the storm and tempest of life the sovereign good of nature the sole support of liberty and the common and prompt remedy of all evil and a the one expect it with fear and tremble the other support it with great ease than life that one complains of it facility now let u leave these boastful courage theodorus answer lysimachus who threaten to kill him thou wilt do a brave feat say he to attain the force of a cantharides the majority of philosopher be observe to have either purposely anticipate or hasten and assist their own death how many ordinary people do we see lead to execution and that not to a simple death but mixed with shame and sometimes with grievous torment appear with such assurance whether through firm courage or natural simplicity that a man can discover no change from their ordinary condition settle their domestic affair commend themselves to their friend sing preaching and address the people nay sometimes sallying into jest and drink to their companion quite as well a socrates one that they be lead to the gallows tell them they must not take him through such a street l a merchant who live there should arrest him by the way for an old debt another tell the hangman he must not touch hi neck for fear of make him laugh he be so ticklish another answer hi confessor who promise him he should that day sup with our lord do you go then say he in my room place for i for my part keep fast today another have call for drink and the hangman have drunk first say he would not drink after him for fear of catch some evil disease everybody have hear the tale of the picard to whom be upon the ladder they present a common wench tell him a our law do some time permit that if he would marry her they would save hi life he have a while consider her and perceiving that she halt come tie up tie up say he she limp and they tell another story of the same kind of a fellow in denmark who be condemn to lose hi head and the like condition be propose to him upon the scaffold refuse it by reason the girl they offer him have hollow cheek and too sharp a nose a servant at toulouse be accuse of heresy for the sum of hi belief refer himself to that of hi master a young student prisoner with him choose rather to die than suffer himself to be persuade that hi master could err we read that of the inhabitant of arras when louis xi take that city a great many let themselves be hang rather than they would say god save the king and amongst that meansouled race of men the buffoon there have be some who would not leave their fooling at the very moment of death one that the hang man be turn off the ladder cry launch the galley an ordinary saying of hi another whom at the point of death hi friend have lay upon a bed of straw before the fire the physician ask him where hi pain lay betwixt the bench and the fire say he and the priest to give him extreme unction grope for hi foot which hi pain have make him pull up to him you will find them say he at the end of my leg to one who be present exhort him to recommend himself to god why who go thither say he and the other reply it will presently be yourself if it be hi good pleasure shall i be sure to be there by tomorrow night say he do but recommend yourself to him say the other and you will soon be there i be best then say he to carry my recommendation myself in the kingdom of narsingah to this day the wife of their priest be bury alive with the body of their husband all other wife be burn at their husband funeral which they not only firmly but cheerfully undergo at the death of their king hi wife and concubine hi favourite all hi officer and domestic servant who make up a whole people present themselves so gaily to the fire where hi body be burn that they seem to take it for a singular honour to accompany their master in death during our late war of milan where there happen so many taking and retaking of town the people impatient of so many change of fortune take such a resolution to die that i have hear my father say he there saw a list take of fiveandtwenty master of family who make themselves away in one week time an incident somewhat resemble that of the xanthians who be besiege by brutus fellmen woman and childreninto such a furious appetite of die that nothing can be do to evade death which they do not to avoid life insomuch that brutus have much difficulty in save a very small number every opinion be of force enough to cause itself to be espouse at the expense of life the first article of that valiant oath that greece take and observe in the median war be that every one should sooner exchange life for death than their own law for those of persia what a world of people do we see in the war betwixt the turk and the greek rather embrace a cruel death than uncircumcise themselves to admit of baptism an example of which no sort of religion be incapable the king of castile have banish the jew out of their dominion john king of portugal in consideration of eight crown a head sell them a retreat into hi for a certain limited time upon condition that the time fix come to expire they should begone and he to furnish them with ship to transport them into africa the day come which once lapse they be give to understand that such a be afterward find in the kingdom should remain slave vessel be very slenderly provide and those who embark in them be rudely and villain use by the passenger who besides other indignity keep them cruise upon the sea one while forward and another backwards till they have spend all their provision and be constrain to buy of them at so dear a rate and so long withal that they set them not on shore till they be all strip to the very shirt the news of this inhuman usage be bring to those who remain behind the great part of them resolve upon slavery and some make a show of change religion emmanuel the successor of john be come to the crown first set them at liberty and afterwards alter hi mind order them to depart hi country assign three port for their passage he hop say bishop osorius no contemptible latin historian of these later time that the favour of the liberty he have give them have fail of convert them to christianity yet the difficulty of commit themselves to the mercy of the mariner and of abandon a country they be now habituate to and be grow very rich in to go and expose themselves in strange and unknown region would certainly do it but find himself deceive in hi expectation and that they be all resolve upon the voyage he cut off two of the three port he have promise them to the end that the length and incommodity of the passage might reduce some or that he might have opportunity by crowd them all into one place the more conveniently to execute what he have design which be to force all the child under fourteen year of age from the arm of their father and mother to transport them from their sight and conversation into a place where they might be instruct and bring up in our religion he say that this produce a most horrid spectacle the natural affection betwixt the parent and their child and moreover their zeal to their ancient belief contend against this violent decree father and mother be commonly see make themselves away and by a yet much more rigorous example precipitate out of love and compassion their young child into well and pit to avoid the severity of this law a to the remainder of them the time that have be prefix be expire for want of mean to transport them they again return into slavery some also turn christian upon whose faith a also that of their posterity even to this day which be a hundred year since few portuguese can yet rely though custom and length of time be much more powerful counsellor in such change than all other constraint whatever in the town of castelnaudari fifty heretic albigeois at one time suffer themselves to be burn alive in one fire rather than they would renounce their opinion i have see an intimate friend of mine run headlong upon death with a real affection and that be root in hi heart by diver plausible argument which he would never permit me to dispossess him of and upon the first honourable occasion that offer itself to him precipitate himself into it without any manner of visible reason with an obstinate and ardent desire of die we have several example in our own time of person even young child who for fear of some little inconvenience have despatch themselves and what shall we not fear say one of the ancient to this purpose if we dread that which cowardice itself have choose for it refuge should i here produce a long catalogue of those of all sex and condition and sect even in the most happy age who have either with great constancy look death in the face or voluntarily seek it and seek it not only to avoid the evil of this life but some purely to avoid the satiety of living and other for the hope of a good condition elsewhere i should never have do nay the number be so infinite that in truth i should have a good bargain ont to reckon up those who have fear it this one therefore shall serve for all pyrrho the philosopher be one day in a boat in a very great tempest shew to those he saw the most affrighted about him and encourage them by the example of a hog that be there nothing at all concern at the storm shall we then dare to say that this advantage of reason of which we so much boast and upon the account of which we think ourselves master and emperor over the rest of all creation be give u for a torment to what end serve the knowledge of thing if it render u more unmanly if we thereby lose the tranquillity and repose we should enjoy without it and if it put u into a bad condition than pyrrhos hog shall we employ the understanding that be confer upon u for our great good to our own ruin set ourselves against the design of nature and the universal order of thing which intend that every one should make use of the faculty member and mean he have to hi own best advantage but it may peradventure be object against me your rule be true enough a to what concern death but what will you say of indigence what will you moreover say of pain which aristippus hieronimus and most of the sage have repute the bad of evil and those who have deny it by word of mouth have however confess it in effect posidonius be extremely torment with a sharp and painful disease pompeius come to visit him excuse himself that he have take so unseasonable a time to come to hear him discourse of philosophy the god forbid say posidonius to him that pain should ever have the power to hinder me from talk and thereupon fell immediately upon a discourse of the contempt of pain but in the meantime hi own infirmity be play hi part and plague him to purpose to which he cry out thou mayest work thy will pain and torment me with all the power thou hast but thou shalt never make me say that thou art an evil this story that they make such a clutter withal what have it to do i fain would know with the contempt of pain he only fight it with word and in the meantime if the shooting and dolour he felt do not move him why do he interrupt hi discourse why do he fancy he do so great a thing in forbear to confess it an evil all do not here consist in the imagination our fancy may work upon other thing but here be the certain science that be play it part of which our sens themselves be judge shall we persuade our skin that the jerk of a whip agreeably tickle u or our taste that a potion of aloe be vin de graf pyrrhos hog be here in the same predicament with u he be not afraid of death ti true but if you beat him he will cry out to some purpose shall we force the general law of nature which in every living creature under heaven be see to tremble under pain the very trees seem to groan under the blow they receive death be only felt by reason forasmuch a it be the motion of an instant a thousand beasts a thousand men be sooner dead than threaten that also which we principally pretend to fear in death be pain it ordinary forerunner yet if we may believe a holy father and i should yet say more probably that neither that which go before nor that which follow after be at all of the appurtenance of death we excuse ourselves falsely and i find by experience that it be rather the impatience of the imagination of death that make u impatient of pain and that we find it doubly grievous a it threaten u with death but reason accuse our cowardice for fear a thing so sudden so inevitable and so insensible we take the other a the more excusable pretence all ills that carry no other danger along with them but simply the evils themselves we treat a thing of no danger the toothache or the gout painful a they be yet be not repute mortal who reckon them in the catalogue of disease but let u presuppose that in death we principally regard the pain a also there be nothing to be fear in poverty but the misery it bring along with it of thirst hunger cold heat watching and the other inconvenience it make u suffer still we have nothing to do with anything but pain i will grant and very willingly that it be the bad incident of our be for i be the man upon earth who the most hate and avoids it consider that hitherto i thank god i have have so little traffic with it but still it be in u if not to annihilate at least to lessen it by patience and though the body and the reason should mutiny to maintain the soul nevertheless in good condition be it not so who have ever give reputation to virtue valour force magnanimity and resolution where be their part to be play if there be no pain to be defy were there no lie upon the hard ground no enduring arm at all point the meridional heat no feed upon the flesh of horse and asses no see a man self hack and hew to piece no suffer a bullet to be pull out from amongst the shattered bone no sew up cauterise and search of wound by what mean be the advantage we covet to have over the vulgar to be acquire ti far from fly evil and pain what the sage say that of action equally good a man should most covet to perform that wherein there be great labour and pain and for this reason it have ever be impossible to persuade our forefather but that the victory obtain by dint of force and the hazard of war be not more honourable than those perform in great security by stratagem or practice besides this ought to be our comfort that naturally if the pain be violent ti but short and if long nothing violent thou wilt not feel it long if thou feelest it too much it will either put an end to itself or to thee it come to the same thing if thou canst not support it it will export thee that which make u suffer pain with so much impatience be the not be accustom to repose our chief contentment in the soul that we do not enough rely upon her who be the sole and sovereign mistress of our condition the body save in the great or less proportion have but one and the same bent and bias whereas the soul be variable into all sort of form and subject to herself and to her own empire all thing whatsoever both the sens of the body and all other accident and therefore it be that we ought to study her to inquire into her and to rouse up all her powerful faculty there be neither reason force nor prescription that can anything prevail against her inclination and choice of so many thousand of bias that she have at her disposal let u give her one proper to our repose and conversation and then we shall not only be shelter and secure from all manner of injury and offence but moreover gratify and oblige if she will with evil and offence she make her profit indifferently of all thing error dream serve her to good use a loyal matter to lodge u in safety and contentment ti plain enough to be see that tis the sharpness of our mind that give the edge to our pain and pleasure beast that have no such thing leave to their body their own free and natural sentiment and consequently in every kind very near the same a appear by the resemble application of their motion if we would not disturb in our member the jurisdiction that appertain to them in this ti to be believe it would be the good for u and that nature have give them a just and moderate temper both to pleasure and pain neither can it fail of be just be equal and common but see we have enfranchise ourselves from her rule to give ourselves up to the ramble liberty of our own fancy let u at least help to incline them to the most agreeable side plato fear our too vehemently engage ourselves with pain and pleasure forasmuch a these too much knit and ally the soul to the body whereas i rather quite contrary by reason it too much separate and disunite them a an enemy be make more fierce by our flight so pain grows proud to see u truckle under her she will surrender upon much good term to them who make head against her a man must oppose and stoutly set himself against her in retire and give ground we invite and pull upon ourselves the ruin that threaten u a the body be more firm in an encounter the more stiffly and obstinately it apply itself to it so be it with the soul but let u come to example which be the proper game of folk of such feeble force a myself where we shall find that it be with pain a with stone that receive a brighter or a duller lustre accord to the foil they be set in and that it have no more room in u than we be pleased to allow it we be more sensible of one little touch of a surgeon lancet than of twenty wound with a sword in the heat of fight the pain of childbearing say by the physician and by god himself to be great and which we pass through with so many ceremoniesthere be whole nation that make nothing of them i set aside the lacedaemonian woman but what els do you find in the swiss among our footsoldiers if not that a they trot after their husband you see them today carry the child at their neck that they carry yesterday in their belly the counterfeit egyptian we have amongst u go themselves to wash theirs so soon a they come into the world and bathe in the first river they meet besides so many wench a daily drop their child by stealth a they conceive them that fair and noble wife of sabinus a patrician of rome for anothers interest endure alone without help without cry out or so much a a groan the bearing of twin a poor simple boy of lacedaemon have steal a fox for they more fear the shame of stupidity in steal than we do the punishment of the knavery and have get it under hi coat rather endure the tear out of hi bowel than he would discover hi theft and another offering incense at a sacrifice suffer himself to be burn to the bone by a coal that fell into hi sleeve rather than disturb the ceremony and there have be a great number for a sole trial of virtue follow their institution who have at seven year old endure to be whip to death without change their countenance and cicero have see them fight in party with fist foot and teeth till they have faint and sink down rather than confess themselves overcome every one know the story of scaevola that have slip into the enemy camp to kill their general and have miss hi blow to repair hi fault by a more strange invention and to deliver hi country he boldly confess to porsenna who be the king he have a purpose to kill not only hi design but moreover add that there be then in the camp a great number of roman hi accomplice in the enterprise a good men a he and to show what a one he himself be have cause a pan of burn coal to be bring he saw and endure hi arm to broil and roast till the king himself conceive horror at the sight command the pan to be take away what would you say of him that would not vouchsafe to respite hi reading in a book whilst he be under incision and of the other that persist to mock and laugh in contempt of the pain inflict upon him so that the provoked cruelty of the executioner that have him in handle and all the invention of torture redouble upon him one after another spent in vain give him the buckler but he be a philosopher but what a gladiator of caesar endure laugh all the while hi wound to be search lanced and laid open let u bring in the woman too who have not hear at paris of her that cause her face to be flay only for the fresh complexion of a new skin there be who have draw good and sound teeth to make their voice more soft and sweet or to place the other teeth in good order how many example of the contempt of pain have we in that sex what can they not do what do they fear to do for never so little hope of an addition to their beauty i have see some of them swallow sand ash and do their utmost to destroy their stomach to get pale complexion to make a fine spanish body what rack will they not endure of gird and brace till they have notch in their side cut into the very quick and sometimes to death it be an ordinary thing with several nation at this day to wind themselves in good earnest to gain credit to what they profess of which our king relate notable example of what he have see in poland and do towards himself but besides this which i know to have be imitate by some in france when i come from that famous assembly of the estate at blois i have a little before see a maid in picardy who to manifest the ardour of her promise a also her constancy give herself with a bodkin she wear in her hair four or five good lusty stab in the arm till the blood gush out to some purpose the turk give themselves great scar in honour of their mistress and to the end they may the long remain they presently clap fire to the wound where they hold it an incredible time to stop the blood and form the cicatrice people that have be eyewitness of it have both write and swear it to me but for ten asper there be there every day fellows to be find that will give themselves a good deep slash in the arm or thigh i be willing however to have the testimony nearest to u when we have most need of them for christendom furnishes u with enough after the example of our bless guide there have be many who have crucify themselves we learn by testimony very worthy of belief that king st louis wear a hairshirt till in hi old age hi confessor give him a dispensation to leave it off and that every friday he cause hi shoulder to be drub by hi priest with five small chain of iron which be always carry about amongst hi night accoutrement for that purpose william our last duke of guienne the father of that eleanor who transmit that duchy to the house of france and england continually for the last ten or twelve year of hi life wear a suit of armour under a religious habit by way of penance foulke count of anjou go as far a jerusalem there to cause himself to be whip by two of hi servant with a rope about hi neck before the sepulchre of our lord but do we not moreover every good friday in various place see great number of men and woman beat and whip themselves till they lacerate and cut the flesh to the very bones i have often see it and tis without any enchantment and it be say there be some amongst them for they go disguise who for money undertook by this mean to save harmless the religion of other by a contempt of pain so much the great a the incentive of devotion be more effectual than those of avarice q maximus bury hi son when he be a consul and m cato hi when praetor elect and l paulus both hi

not follow these monstrous humour though i lose two or three at nurse if not without grief at least without repine and yet there be hardly any accident that pierce near to the quick i see a great many other occasion of sorrow that should they happen to me i should hardly feel and have despise some when they have befall me to which the world have give so terrible a figure that i should blush to

either their virtue or their use but only how dear they cost u a though that be a part of their substance and we only repute for value in them not what they bring to u but what we add to them by which

childhood live in three sort of condition the first which continue for some twenty year i pass over without any other mean but what be casual and depend upon the allowance and assistance of other

more at my ease i never have the repulse of find the purse of any of my friend shut against me have enjoin myself this necessity above all other necessity whatever by no mean to fail of payment at the appointed time which also they have a thousand times respite see how careful i be to satisfy them so that i practise at once a thrifty and withal a kind of allure honesty i naturally feel a kind of pleasure in pay a if i ease my shoulder of a troublesome weight and free myself from an image of slavery a also that i find a ravish kind of satisfaction in please another and do a just action i except payment where the trouble of bargaining and reckoning be require and in such case where i can meet with nobody to ease me of that charge i delay them how scandalously and injuriously soever all i possibly can for fear of the wrangling for which both my humour and way of speaking be so totally improper and unfit there be nothing i hate so much a drive a bargain ti a mere traffic of cozenage and impudence where after an hour cheapen and hesitate both party abandon their word and oath for five sol abatement yet i always borrow at great disadvantage for want the confidence to speak to the person myself i commit my request to the persuasion of a letter which usually be no very successful advocate and be of very great advantage to him who have a mind to deny i in those day more jocundly and freely refer the conduct of my affair to the star than i have since do to my own providence and judgment most good manager look upon it a a horrible thing to live always thus in uncertainty and do not consider in the first place that the great part of the world live so how many worthy men have wholly abandon their own certainty and yet daily do it to the wind to trust to the inconstant favour of prince and of fortune caesar run above a million of gold more than he be worth in debt to become caesar and how many merchant have begin their traffic by the sale of their farm which they send into the indie in so great a siccity of devotion a we see in these day we have a thousand and a thousand colleges that pas it over commodiously enough expect every day their dinner from the liberality of heaven secondly they do not take notice that this certitude upon which they so much rely be not much less uncertain and hazardous than hazard itself i see misery a near beyond two thousand crown a year a if it stand close by me for besides that it be in the power of chance to make a hundred breach to poverty through the great strength of our rich there be very often no mean betwixt the high and the low fortune and to turn all our barricadoes and bulwark topsyturvy i find that by diver cause indigence be as frequently see to inhabit with those who have estate a with those that have none and that peradventure it be then far less grievous when alone than when accompany with rich these flow more from good management than from revenue and an uneasy necessitous busy rich man seem to me more miserable than he that be simply poor the great and most wealthy prince be by poverty and want drive to the most extreme necessity for can there be any more extreme than to become tyrant and unjust usurper of their subject good and estate my second condition of life be to have money of my own wherein i so order the matter that i have soon lay up a very notable sum out of a mean fortune consider with myself that that only be to be repute have which a man reserve from hi ordinary expense and that a man can not absolutely rely upon revenue he hop to receive how clear soever the hope may be for what say i if i should be surprise by such or such an accident and after suchlike vain and vicious imagination would very learnedly by this hoarding of money provide against all inconvenience and could moreover answer such a object to me that the number of these be too infinite that if i could not lay up for all i could however do it at least for some and for many yet be not this do without a great deal of solicitude and anxiety of mind i keep it very close and though i dare talk so boldly of myself never speak of my money but falsely a other do who be rich pretend to be poor and be poor pretend to be rich dispense their conscience from ever tell sincerely what they have a ridiculous and shameful prudence wa i go a journey methought i be never enough provide and the more i load myself with money the more also be i load with fear one while of the danger of the road another of the fidelity of him who have the charge of my baggage of whom a some other that i know i be never sufficiently secure if i have him not always in my eye if i chance to leave my cashbox behind me o what strange suspicion and anxiety of mind do i enter into and which be bad without dare to acquaint anybody with it my mind be eternally take up with such thing a these so that all thing consider there be more trouble in keep money than in get it and if i do not altogether so much a i say or be not really so scandalously solicitous of my money a i have make myself out to be yet it cost me something at least to restrain myself from be so i reap little or no advantage by what i have and my expense seem nothing less to me for have the more to spend for a bion say the hairy men be as angry a the bald to be pull and after you be once accustom to it and have once set your heart upon your heap it be no more at your service you can not find in your heart to break it ti a building that you will fancy must of necessity all tumble down to ruin if you stir but the least pebble necessity must first take you by the throat before you can prevail upon yourself to touch it and i would sooner have pawn anything i have or sell a horse and with much less constraint upon myself than have make the least breach in that beloved purse i have so carefully lay by but the danger be that a man can not easily prescribe certain limit to this desire they be hard to find in thing that a man conceive to be good and to stint this good husbandry so that it may not degenerate into avarice men still be intent upon add to the heap and increase the stock from sum to sum till at last they vilely deprive themselves of the enjoyment of their own proper good and throw all into reserve without make any use of them at all accord to this rule they be the rich people in the world who be set to guard the wall and gate of a wealthy city all moneyed men i conclude to be covetous plato place corporal or human good in this order health beauty strength rich and rich say he be not blind but very clearsighted when illuminate by prudence dionysius the son do a very handsome act upon this subject he be inform that one of the syracusans have hide a treasure in the earth and thereupon sent to the man to bring it to him which he accordingly do privately reserve a small part of it only to himself with which he go to another city where be cure of hi appetite of hoard he begin to live at a more liberal rate which dionysius hearing cause the rest of hi treasure to be restore to him say that since he have learn to use it he very willingly return it back to him i continue some year in this hoard humour when i know not what good demon fortunately put me out of it a he do the syracusan and make me throw abroad all my reserve at random the pleasure of a certain journey i take at very great expense have make me spurn this fond love of money underfoot by which mean i be now fall into a third way of living i speak what i think of it doubtless much more pleasant and regular which be that i live at the height of my revenue sometimes the one sometimes the other may perhaps exceed but tis very little and but rarely that they differ i live from hand to mouth and content myself in have sufficient for my present and ordinary expense for a to extraordinary occasion all the lay up in the world would never suffice and tis the great folly imaginable to expect that fortune should ever sufficiently arm u against herself ti with our own arm that we be to fight her accidental one will betray u in the pinch of the business if i lay up ti for some near and contemplate purpose not to purchase land of which i have no need but to purchase pleasure i neither be in any great apprehension of want nor in desire of any more and i be very well pleased that this reformation in me have fall out in an age naturally incline to avarice and that i see myself clear of a folly so common to old men and the most ridiculous of all human folly feraulez a man that have run through both fortune and find that the increase of substance be no increase of appetite either to eating or drinking sleeping or the enjoyment of hi wife and who on the other side felt the care of hi economics lie heavy upon hi shoulder a it do on mine be resolve to please a poor young man hi faithful friend who pant after rich and make him a gift of all hi which be excessively great and moreover of all he be in the daily way of get by the liberality of cyrus hi good master and by the war conditionally that he should take care handsomely to maintain and plentifully to entertain him a hi guest and friend which be accordingly do they afterwards lived very happily together both of them equally content with the change of their condition ti an example that i could imitate with all my heart and i very much approve the fortune of the aged prelate whom i see to have so absolutely strip himself of hi purse hi revenue and care of hi expense commit them one while to one trusty servant and another while to another that he have spin out a long succession of year a ignorant by this mean of hi domestic affair a a mere stranger the confidence in another man virtue be no light evidence of a man own and god willingly favour such a confidence a to what concern him of whom i be speak i see nowhere a good govern house more nobly and constantly maintain than hi happy to have regulate hi affair to so just a proportion that hi estate be sufficient to do it without hi care or trouble and without any hindrance either in the spending or lay it up to hi other more quiet employment and more suitable both to hi place and like plenty then and indigence depend upon the opinion every one have of them and riches no more than glory or health have other beauty or pleasure than he lend them by whom they be possess every one be well or ill at ease accord a he so find himself not he whom the world believe but he who believe himself to be so be content and in this alone belief give itself be and reality fortune do u neither good nor hurt she only present u the matter and the seed which our soul more powerful than she turn and applies a she best please the sole cause and sovereign mistress of her own happy or unhappy condition all external accession receive taste and colour from the internal constitution a clothes warm u not with their heat but our own which they be fit to cover and nourish he who would shield therewith a cold body would do the same service for the cold for so snow and ice be preserve and cert after the same manner that study be a torment to an idle man abstinence from wine to a drunkard frugality to the spendthrift and exercise to a lazy tenderbred fellow so it be of all the rest the thing be not so painful and difficult of themselves but our weakness or cowardice make them so to judge of great and high matter require a suitable soul otherwise we attribute the vice to them which be really our own a straight oar seem crook in the water it do not only import that we see the thing but how and after what manner we see it after all this why amongst so many discourse that by so many argument persuade men to despise death and to endure pain can we not find out one that help u and of so many sort of imagination a have so prevail upon other a to persuade them to do so why do not every one apply some one to himself the most suitable to hi own humour if he can not digest a strongworking decoction to eradicate the evil let him at least take a lenitive to ease it a to the rest a man do not transgress philosophy by permit the acrimony of pain and human frailty to prevail so much above measure for they constrain her to go back to her unanswerable reply if it be ill to live in necessity at least there be no necessity upon a man to live in necessity no man continue ill long but by hi own fault he who have neither the courage to die nor the heart to live who will neither resist nor fly what can we do with him of all the folly of the world that which be most universally receive be the solicitude of reputation and glory which we be fond of to that degree a to abandon rich peace life and health which be effectual and substantial good to pursue this vain phantom and empty word that have neither body nor hold to be take of it and of all the irrational humour of men it should seem that the philosopher themselves be among the last and the most reluctant to disengage themselves from this ti the most restive and obstinate of all there be not any one of which reason so clearly accuse the vanity but it be so deeply root in u that i dare not determine whether any one ever clearly discharge himself from it or no after you have say all and believe all have be say to it prejudice it produce so intestine an inclination in opposition to your best argument that you have little power to resist it for a cicero say even those who most controvert it would yet that the book they write about it should visit the light under their own name and seek to derive glory from seem to despise it all other thing be communicable and fall into commerce we lend our good and stake our life for the necessity and service of our friend but to communicate a man honour and to robe another with a man own glory be very rarely see and yet we have some example of that kind catulus luctatius in the cimbrian war have do all that in him lay to make hi fly soldier face about upon the enemy run himself at last away with the rest and counterfeit the coward to the end hi men might rather seem to follow their captain than to fly from the enemy which be to abandon hi own reputation in order to cover the shame of other when charles v come into provence in the year 1537 ti say that antonio de lev see the emperor positively resolve upon this expedition and believe it would redound very much to hi honour do nevertheless very stiffly oppose it in the council to the end that the entire glory of that resolution should be attribute to hi master and that it might be say hi own wisdom and foresight have be such a that contrary to the opinion of all he have bring about so great an enterprise which be to do him honour at hi own expense the thracian ambassador come to comfort archileonida the mother of brasidas upon the death of her son and commend him to that height a to say he have not leave hi like behind him she reject this private and particular commendation to attribute it to the public tell me not that say she i know the city of sparta have many citizen both great and of great worth than he in the battle of crecy the prince of wale be then very young have the vanguard commit to him the main stress of the battle happen to be in that place which make the lord who be with him find themselves overmatched send to king edward to advance to their relief he inquire of the condition hi son be in and be answer that he be alive and on horseback i should then do him wrong say the king now to go and deprive him of the honour of win this battle he have so long and so bravely sustain what hazard soever he run that shall be entirely hi own and accordingly would neither go nor send knowing that if he go it would be say all have be lose without hi succour and that the honour of the victory would be wholly attribute to him many at rome thought and would usually say that the great of scipio act be in part due to laelius whose constant practice it be still to advance and support scipio grandeur and renown without any care of hi own and theopompus king of sparta to him who tell him the republic could not miscarry since he know so well how to command ti rather answer he because the people know so well how to obey a woman succeed to peerage have notwithstanding their sex the privilege to attend and give their vote in the trial that appertain to the jurisdiction of peer so the ecclesiastical peer notwithstanding their profession be oblige to attend our king in their war not only with their friend and servant but in their own person a the bishop of beauvais do who be with philip augustus at the battle of bouvines have a notable share in that action but he do not think it fit for him to participate in the fruit and glory of that violent and bloody trade he with hi own hand reduce several of the enemy that day to hi mercy whom he deliver to the first gentleman he meet either to kill or receive them to quarter refer the whole execution to this other hand and he do this with regard to william earl of salisbury whom he give up to messire jehan de nesle with a like subtlety of conscience to that i have just name he would kill but not wind and for that reason ever fight with a mace and a certain person of my time be reproach by the king that he have lay hand on a priest stiffly and positively deny he have do any such thing the meaning of which be he have cudgel and kick him plutarch say somewhere that he do not find so great a difference betwixt beast and beast a he do betwixt man and man which he say in reference to the internal quality and perfection of the soul and in truth i find so vast a distance betwixt epaminondas accord to my judgment of him and some that i know who be yet men of good sense that i could willingly enhance upon plutarch and say that there be more difference betwixt such and such a man than there be betwixt such a man and such a beast and that there be a many and innumerable degree of mind a there be cubit betwixt this and heaven but a touch the estimate of men tis strange that ourselves except no other creature be esteem beyond it proper quality we commend a horse for hi strength and sureness of foot and not for hi rich caparison a greyhound for hi speed of heel not for hi fine collar a hawk for her wing not for her ge and bell why in like manner do we not value a man for what be properly hi own he have a great train a beautiful palace so much credit so many thousand pound a year all these be about him but not in him you will not buy a pig in a poke if you cheapen a horse you will see him strip of hi housingcloths you will see him naked and open to your eye or if he be clothe a they anciently be wont to present them to princes to sell ti only on the less important part that you may not so much consider the beauty of hi colour or the breadth of hi crupper a principally to examine hi legs eye and foot which be the member of great use why in give your estimate of a man do you prize him wrapped and muffle up in clothes he then discover nothing to you but such part a be not in the least hi own and conceals those by which alone one may rightly judge of hi value ti the price of the blade that you inquire into not of the scabbard you would not peradventure bid a farthing for him if you saw him strip you be to judge him by himself and not by what he wear and a one of the ancient very pleasantly say do you know why you repute him tall you reckon withal the height of hi patten the pedestal be no part of the statue measure him without hi stilt let him lay aside hi revenue and hi title let him present himself in hi shirt then examine if hi body be sound and sprightly active and dispose to perform it function what soul have he be she beautiful capable and happily provide of all her faculty be she rich of what be her own or of what she have borrow ha fortune no hand in the affair can she without wink stand the lightning of sword be she indifferent whether her life expire by the mouth or through the throat be she settle even and content this be what be to be examine and by that you be to judge of the vast difference betwixt man and man be he such a man be five hundred cubit above kingdom and duchy he be an absolute monarch in and to himself what remain for him to covet or desire compare with such a one the common rabble of mankind stupid and meanspirited servile instable and continually float with the tempest of various passion that toss and tumble them to and fro and all depend upon other and you will find a great distance than betwixt heaven and earth and yet the blindness of common usage be such that we make little or no account of it whereas if we consider a peasant and a king a nobleman and a vassal a magistrate and a private man a rich man and a poor there appear a vast disparity though they differ no more a a man may say than in their breech in thrace the king be distinguish from hi people after a very pleasant and especial manner he have a religion by himself a god all hi own and which hi subject be not to presume to adore which be mercury whilst on the other hand he disdain to have anything to do with theirs mar bacchus and diana and yet they be no other than picture that make no essential dissimilitude for a you see actor in a play represent the person of a duke or an emperor upon the stage and immediately after return to their true and original condition of valet and porter so the emperor whose pomp and lustre so dazzle you in public do but peep behind the curtain and you will see no thing more than an ordinary man and peradventure more contemptible than the mean of hi subject cowardice irresolution ambition spite and envy agitate him as much a another care and fear attack him even in the centre of hi battalion do fever gout and apoplexy spare him any more than one of u when old age hang heavy upon hi shoulder can the yeoman of hi guard ease him of the burden when he be astound with the apprehension of death can the gentleman of hi bedchamber comfort and assure him when jealousy or any other caprice swim in hi brain can our compliment and ceremony restore him to hi goodhumour the canopy embroider with pearl and gold he lie under have no virtue against a violent fit of the colic the flatterer of alexander the great possess him that he be the son of jupiter but be one day wound and observe the blood stream from hi wound what say you now my master say he be not this blood of a crimson colour and purely human this be not of the complexion of that which homer make to issue from the wounded god the poet hermodorus have write a poem in honour of antigonus wherein he call him the son of the sun he who have the emptying of my closestool say antigonus know to the contrary he be but a man at best and if he be deform or illqualified from hi birth the empire of the universe can not set him to right what of all that if he be a fool even pleasure and good fortune be not relish without vigour and understanding whatever the benefit of fortune be they yet require a palate to relish them ti fruition and not possession that render u happy he be a sot hi taste be pal and flat he no more enjoy what he have than one that have a cold relish the flavour of canary or than a horse be sensible of hi rich caparison plato be in the right when he tell u that health beauty vigour and rich and all the other thing call good be equally evil to the unjust as good to the just and the evil on the contrary the same and therefore where the body and the mind be in disorder to what use serve these external convenience consider that the least prick with a pin or the least passion of the soul be sufficient to deprive one of the pleasure of be sole monarch of the world at the first twitch of the gout it signify much to be call sir and your majesty do he not forget hi palace and girandeurs if he be angry can hi be a prince keep him from look red and look pale and grind hi teeth like a madman now if he be a man of part and of right nature royalty add very little to hi happiness he discern ti nothing but counterfeit and gullery nay perhaps he would be of king seleucus opinion that he who know the weight of a sceptre would not stoop to pick it up if he saw it lie before him so great and painful be the duty incumbent upon a good king assuredly it can be no easy task to rule other when we find it so hard a matter to govern ourselves and a to dominion that seem so charm the frailty of human judgment and the difficulty of choice in thing that be new and doubtful consider i be very much of opinion that it be far more easy and pleasant to follow than to lead and that it be a great settlement and satisfaction of mind to have only one path to walk in and to have none to answer for but a man self to which we may add that say of cyrus that no man be fit to rule but he who in hi own worth be of great value than those he be to govern but king hiero in xenophon say far that in the fruition even of pleasure itself they be in a bad condition than private men forasmuch a the opportunity and facility they have of command those thing at will take off from the delight that ordinary folk enjoy can we think that the sing boy of the choir take any great delight in music the satiety rather render it troublesome and tedious to them feast ball masquerade and tiltings delight such a but rarely see and desire to see them but have be frequently at such entertainment the relish of them grow flat and insipid nor do woman so much delight those who make a common practice of the sport he who will not give himself leisure to be thirsty can never find the true pleasure of drinking farce and tumble trick be pleasant to the spectator but a wearisome toil to those by whom they be perform and that this be so we see that prince divert themselves sometimes in disguise their quality awhile to depose themselves and to stoop to the poor and ordinary way of living of the mean of their people nothing be so distasteful and clog a abundance what appetite would not be baffle to see three hundred woman at it mercy a the grand signor have in hi seraglio and of hi ancestor what fruition or taste of sport do he reserve to himself who never go hawk without seven thousand falconer and besides all this i fancy that this lustre of grandeur brings with it no little disturbance and uneasiness upon the enjoyment of the most tempting pleasures the great be too conspicuous and lie too open to every one view neither do i know to what end a man should more require of them to conceal their error since what be only reputed indiscretion in u the people in them brand with the name of tyranny and contempt of the law and besides their proclivity to vice be apt to hold that it be a heightening of pleasure to them to insult over and to trample upon public observance plato indeed in hi goygias define a tyrant to be one who in a city have licence to do whatever hi own will lead him to do and by reason of this impunity the display and publication of their vice do ofttimes more mischief than the vice itself every one fear to be pry into and overlook but prince be so even to their very gesture look and thoughts the people conceive they have right and title to be judge of them besides that the blemish of the great naturally appear great by reason of the eminence and lustre of the place where they be seat and that a mole or a wart appear great in them than a wide gash in other and this be the reason why the poet feign the amour of jupiter to be perform in the disguise of so many borrow shape and that amongst the many amorous practice they lay to hi charge there be only one a i remember where he appear in hi own majesty and grandeur but let u return to hiero who far complains of the inconvenience he find in hi royalty in that he could not look abroad and travel the world at liberty be a it be a prisoner in the bound and limit of hi own dominion and that in all hi action he be evermore surround with an importunate crowd and in truth to see our king sit all alone at table environ with so many people prate about them and so many stranger star upon them a they always be i have often be move rather to pity than to envy their condition king alfonso be wont to say that in this ass be in a good condition than king their master permit them to fee at their own ease and pleasure a favour that king can not obtain of their servant and it have never come into my fancy that it could be of any great benefit to the life of a man of sense to have twenty people prate about him when he be at stool or that the service of a man of ten thousand livres a year or that have take casale or defend siena should be either more commodious or more acceptable to him than those of a good groom of the chamber who understand hi place the advantage of sovereignty be in a manner but imaginary every degree of fortune have in it some image of principality caesar call all the lord of france have free franchise within their own demesne roitelets or petty king and in truth the name of sire except they go pretty far towards kingship for do but look into the province remote from court a brittany for example take notice of the train the vassal the officer the employment service ceremony and state of a lord who live retire from court in hi own house amongst hi own tenant and servant and observe withal the flight of hi imagination there be nothing more royal he hear talk of hi master once a year a of a king of persia without take any further recognition of him than by some remote kindred hi secretary keep in some register and to speak the truth our law be easy enough so easy that a gentleman of france scarce feel the weight of sovereignty pinch hi shoulder above twice in hi life real and effectual subjection only concern such amongst u a voluntarily thrust their neck under the yoke and who design to get wealth and honour by such service for a man that love hi own fireside and can govern hi house without fall by the ear with hi neighbour or engage in suit of law be as free a a duke of venice but that which hiero be most concerned at be that he find himself strip of all friendship deprive of all mutual society wherein the true and most perfect fruition of human life consist for what testimony of affection and goodwill can i extract from him that owe me whether he will or no all that he be able to do can i form any assurance of hi real respect to me from hi humble way of speaking and submissive behaviour when these be ceremony it be not in hi choice to deny the honour we receive from those that fear u be not honour those respect be due to royalty and not to me do i not see that the wicked and the good king he that be hat and he that be beloved have the one a much reverence pay him a the other my predecessor be and my successor shall be serve with the same ceremony and state if my subject do me no harm ti no evidence of any good affection why should i look upon it a such see it be not in their power to do it if they would no one follow me or obey my command upon the account of any friendship betwixt him and me there can be no contracting of friendship where there be so little relation and correspondence my own height have put me out of the familiarity of and intelligence with men there be too great disparity and disproportion betwixt u they follow me either upon the account of decency and custom or rather my fortune than me to increase their own all they say to me or do for me be but outward paint appearance their liberty be on all part restrain by the great power and authority i have over them i see nothing about me but what be dissemble and disguise the emperor julian be one day applaud by hi courtier for hi exact justice i should be proud of these praise say he do they come from person that durst condemn or disapprove the contrary in case i should do it all the real advantage of prince be common to them with men of meaner condition ti for the god to mount winged horse and fee upon ambrosia they have no other sleep nor other appetite than we the steel they arm themselves withal be of no good temper than that we also use their crown neither defend them from the rain nor the sun diocletian who wear a crown so fortunate and revere resign it to retire to the felicity of a private life and some time after the necessity of public affair require that he should reassume hi charge he make answer to those who come to court him to it you would not offer say he to persuade me to this have you see the fine order of the tree i have plant in my orchard and the fair melon i have sow in my garden in anacharsis opinion the happy state of government would be where all other thing be equal precedence should be measure out by the virtue and repulse by the vice of men when king pyrrhus prepare for hi expedition into italy hi wise counsellor cyneas to make him sensible of the vanity of hi ambition well sir say he to what end do you make all this mighty preparationto make myself master of italy reply the king and what after that be do say cyneas i will pass over into gaul and spain say the other and what theni will then go to subdue africa and lastly when i have bring the whole world to my subjection i will sit down and rest content at my own ease for god sake sir reply cyneas tell me what hinder that you may not if you please be now in the condition you speak of why do you not now at this instant settle yourself in the state you seem to aim at and spare all the labour and hazard you interpose i will conclude with an old versicle that i think very apt to the purpose the way by which our law attempt to regulate idle and vain expense in meat and clothes seem to be quite contrary to the end design the true way would be to beget in men a contempt of silk and gold a vain frivolous and useless whereas we augment to them the honour and enhance the value of such thing which sure be a very improper way to create a disgust for to enact that none but prince shall eat turbot shall wear velvet or gold lace and interdict these thing to the people what be it but to bring them into a great esteem and to set every one more agog to eat and wear them let king leave off these ensign of grandeur they have other enough besides those excess be more excusable in any other than a prince we may learn by the example of several nation well way of exterior distinction of quality which truly i conceive to be very requisite in a state enough without foster to this purpose such corruption and manifest inconvenience ti strange how suddenly and with how much ease custom in these indifferent thing establish itself and become authority we have scarce worn cloth a year in compliance with the court for the mourning of henry ii but that silk be already grow into such contempt with every one that a man so clad be presently conclude a citizen silk be divide betwixt the physician and surgeon and though all other people almost go in the same habit there be notwithstanding in one thing or other sufficient distinction of the several condition of men how suddenly do greasy chamois and linen doublet become the fashion in our army whilst all neatness and richness of habit fall into contempt let king but lead the dance and begin to leave off this expense and in a month the business will be do throughout the kingdom without edict or ordinance we shall all follow it should be rather proclaim on the contrary that no one should wear scarlet or goldsmiths work but courtesan and tumbler zeleucus by the like invention reclaim the corrupted manner of the locrians hi law be that no free woman should be allow any more than one maid to follow her unless she be drunk nor be to stir out of the city by night wear jewel of gold about her or go in an embroidered robe unless she be a professed and public prostitute that bravo except no man be to wear a gold ring nor be see in one of those effeminate robe weave in the city of miletus by which infamous exception he discreetly divert hi citizen from superfluity and pernicious pleasure and it be a project of great utility to attract then by honour and ambition to their duty and obedience our king can do what they please in such external reformation their own inclination stand in this case for a law whatever be do at court pass for a rule through the rest of france let the courtier fall out with these abominable breech that discover so much of those part should be conceal these great belly doublet that make u look like i know not what and be so unfit to admit of arm these long effeminate lock of hair this foolish custom of kiss what we present to our equal and our hand in salute them a ceremony in former time only due to prince let them not permit that a gentleman shall appear in place of respect without hi sword unbutton and untrussed a though he come from the house of office and that contrary to the custom of our forefather and the particular privilege of the noble of this kingdom we stand a long time bare to them in what place soever and the same to a hundred other so many tiercelets and quartelets of king we have get nowadays and other like vicious innovation they will see them all presently vanish and cry down these be ti true but superficial error but they be of ill augury and enough to inform u that the whole fabric be crazy and totter when we see the roughcast of our wall to cleave and split plato in hi law esteem nothing of more pestiferous consequence to hi city than to give young men the liberty of introduce any change in their habit gesture dance song and exercise from one form to another shift from this to that hunting after novelty and applaud the inventor by which mean manner be corrupt and the old institution come to be nauseate and despise in all thing save only in those that be evil a change be to be fear even the change of season wind viand and humour and no law be in their true credit but such to which god have give so long a continuance that no one know their beginning or that there ever be any other reason directs that we should always go the same way but not always at the same pace and consequently though a wise man ought not so much to give the rein to human passion a to let him deviate from the right path he may notwithstanding without prejudice to hi duty leave it to them to hasten or to slacken hi speed and not fix himself like a motionless and insensible colossus could virtue itself put on flesh and blood i believe the pulse would beat faster go on to assault than in go to dinner that be to say there be a necessity she should heat and be move upon this account i have take notice a of an extraordinary thing of some great men who in the high enterprise and most important affair have keep themselves in so settled and serene a calm a not at all to break their sleep alexander the great on the day assign for that furious battle betwixt him and darius sleep so profoundly and so long in the morning that parmenio be force to enter hi chamber and come to hi bedside to call him several time by hi name the time to go to fight compel him so to do the emperor otho have put on a resolution to kill himself that night after have settle hi domestic affair divide hi money amongst hi servant and set a good edge upon a sword he have make choice of for the purpose and now stay only to be satisfy whether all hi friend have retire in safety he fell into so sound a sleep that the gentleman of hi chamber hear him snore the death of this emperor have in it circumstance parallel that of the great cato and particularly this just relate for cato be ready to despatch himself whilst he only stay hi hand in expectation of the return of a messenger he have send to bring him news whether the senator he have send away be put out from the port of utica he fell into so sound a sleep that they hear him snore in the next room and the man whom he have send to the port have awaken him to let him know that the tempestuous weather have hinder the senator from put to sea he despatch away another messenger and compose again himself in the bed settle to sleep and sleep till by the return of the last messenger he have certain intelligence they be go we may here far compare him with alexander in the great and dangerous storm that threaten him by the sedition of the tribune metellus who attempt to publish a decree for the call in of pompey with hi army into the city at the time of catilines conspiracy be only and that stoutly oppose by cato so that very sharp language and bitter menace pass betwixt them in the senate about that affair but it be the next day in the forenoon that the controversy be to be decide where metellus besides the favour of the people and of caesarat that time of pompey factionwas to appear accompany with a rabble of slave and gladiator and cato only fortify with hi own courage and constancy so that hi relation domestic and many virtuous people of hi friend be in great apprehension for him and to that degree that some there be who pass over the whole night without sleep eating or drinking for the danger they saw him run into hi wife and sister do nothing but weep and torment themselves in hi house whereas he on the contrary comfort every one and after have sup after hi usual manner go to bed and sleep profoundly till morning when one of hi fellowtribunes rouse him to go to the encounter the knowledge we have of the greatness of this man courage by the rest of hi life may warrant u certainly to judge that hi indifference proceed from a soul so much elevate above such accident that he disdain to let it take any more hold of hi fancy than any ordinary incident in the naval engagement that augustus win of sextus pompeius in sicily just a they be to begin the fight he be so fast asleep that hi friend be compel to wake him to give the signal of battle and this be it that give mark antony afterwards occasion to reproach him that he have not the courage so much a with open eye to behold the order of hi own squadron and not to have dare to present himself before the soldier till first agrippa have bring him news of the victory obtain but a to the young marius who do much bad for the day of hi last battle against sylla after he have marshal hi army and give the word and signal of battle he lay him down under the shade of a tree to repose himself and fell so fast asleep that the rout and flight of hi men could hardly waken him he have see nothing of the fight he be say to have be at that time so extremely spent and wear out with labour and want of sleep that nature could hold out no longer now upon what have be say the physician may determine whether sleep be so necessary that our life depend upon it for we read that king perseus of macedon be prisoner at rome be kill by be keep from sleep but pliny instance such a have live long without sleep herodotus speaks of nation where the men sleep and wake by halfyears and they who write the life of the sage epimenides affirm that he sleep sevenandfifty year together our battle of dreux be remarkable for several extraordinary incident but such a have no great kindness for m de guise nor much favour hi reputation be willing to have him think to blame and that hi make a halt and delaying time with the force he command whilst the constable who be general of the army be rack through and through with the enemy artillery hi battalion rout and himself take prisoner be not to be excuse and that he have much well have run the hazard of charge the enemy in flank than stay for the advantage of fall in upon the rear to suffer so great and so important a loss but besides what the event demonstrate he who will consider it without passion or prejudice will easily be induce to confess that the aim and design not of a captain only but of every private soldier ought to regard the victory in general and that no particular occurrence how nearly soever they may concern hi own interest should divert him from that pursuit philopoemen in an encounter with machanidas have send before a good strong party of hi archer and slinger to begin the skirmish and these be rout and hotly pursue by the enemy who push on the fortune of their arm and in that pursuit passing by the battalion where philopoemen be though hi soldier be impatient to fall on he do not think fit to stir from hi post nor to present himself to the enemy to relieve hi men but have suffer these to be chase and cut in piece before hi face charge in upon the enemys foot when he saw them leave unprotected by the horse and notwithstanding that they be lacedaemonians yet take them in the nick when think themselves secure of the victory they begin to disorder their rank he do this business with great facility and then put himself in pursuit of machanidas which case be very like that of monsieur de guise in that bloody battle betwixt agesilaus and the boeotian which xenophon who be present at it report to be the sharp that he have ever see agesilaus waive the advantage that fortune present him to let the boeotian battalion pas by and then to charge them in the rear how certain soever he might make himself of the victory judging it would rather be an effect of conduct than valour to proceed that way and therefore to show hi prowess rather choose with a marvellous ardour of courage to charge them in the front but he be well beat and well wound for hi pain and constrain at last to disengage himself and to take the course he have at first neglect open hi battalion to give way to this torrent of boeotian and they be pass by take notice that they march in disorder like men who think themselves out of danger he pursue and charge them in flank yet could not so prevail a to bring it to so general a rout but that they leisurely retreat still face about upon him till they have retire to safety what variety of herbs soever be shufed together in the dish yet the whole mass be swallow up under one name of a sallet in like manner under the consideration of name i will make a hodgepodge of diver article every nation have certain name that i know not why be take in no good sense a with u john william benedict in the genealogy of prince also there seem to be certain name fatally affect a the ptolemy of egypt the henry in england the charles in france the baldwin in flanders and the williams of our ancient aquitaine from whence ti say the name of guyenne have it derivation which would seem far fetch be there not a crude derivation in plato himself item tis a frivolous thing in itself but nevertheless worthy to be record for the strangeness of it that be write by an eyewitness that henry duke of normandy son of henry ii king of england make a great feast in france the concourse of nobility and gentry be so great that be for sport sake divide into troop accord to their name in the first troop which consist of williams there be find an hundred and ten knight sit at the table of that name without reckon the ordinary gentleman and servant it be as pleasant to distinguish the table by the name of the guest a it be in the emperor geta to distinguish the several course of hi meat by the first letter of the meat themselves so that those that begin with b be serve up together a brawn beef bream bustard beccaficos and so of the other item there be a say that it be a good thing to have a good name that be to say credit and a good repute but besides this it be really convenient to have a wellsounding name such a be easy of pronunciation and easy to be remember by reason that king and other great person do by that mean the more easily know and the more hardly forget u and indeed of our own servant we more frequently call and employ those whose name be most ready upon the tongue i myself have see henry ii when he could not for hi heart hit of a gentleman name of our country of gascony and moreover be fain to call one of the queen maid of honour by the general name of her race her own family name be so difficult to pronounce or remember and socrates think it worthy a father care to give fine name to hi child item ti say that the foundation of notre dame la grand at poitier take it original from hence that a debauched young fellow formerly live in that place have get to him a wench and at her first come in ask her name and be answer that it be mary he felt himself so suddenly pierce through with the awe of religion and the reverence to that sacred name of the blessed virgin that he not only immediately send the girl away but become a reform man and so continue the remainder of hi life and that in consideration of this miracle there be erect upon the place where this young man house stand first a chapel dedicate to our lady and afterwards the church that we now see stand there this vocal and auricular reproof work upon the conscience and that right into the soul this that follow insinuate itself merely by the sens pythagoras be in company with some wild young fellow and perceive that heat with the feast they complot to go violate an honest house command the sing wench to alter her wanton air and by a solemn grave and spondaic music gently enchant and lay asleep their ardour item will not posterity say that our modern reformation have be wonderfully delicate and exact in have not only combated error and vice and fill the world with devotion humility obedience peace and all sort of virtue but in have proceed so far a to quarrel with our ancient baptismal name of charles louis francis to fill the world with methuselah ezekiel and malachi name of a more spiritual sound a gentleman a neighbour of mine a great admirer of antiquity and who be always extol the excellence of former time in comparison with this present age of ours do not amongst the rest forget to dwell upon the lofty and magnificent sound of the gentleman name of those day don grumedan quedregan agesilan which but to hear name he conceive to denote other kind of men than pierre guillot and michel item i be mightily pleased with jacques amyot for leave throughout a whole french oration the latin name entire without vary and garble them to give them a french cadence it seem a little harsh and rough at first but already custom by the authority of hi plutarch have overcome that novelty i have often wish that such a write history in latin would leave our name a they find them and a they be for in make vaudemont into vallemontanus and metamorphose name to make them suit well with the greek or latin we know not where we be and with the person of the men lose the benefit of the story to conclude ti a scurvy custom and of very ill consequence that we have in our kingdom of france to call every one by the name of hi manor or seigneury ti the thing in the world that the most prejudice and confounds family and descent a young brother of a good family have a manor leave him by hi father by the name of which he have be know and honour can not handsomely leave it ten year after hi decease it fall into the hand of a stranger who do the same do but judge whereabouts we shall be concern the knowledge of these men we need look no further for example than our own royal family where every partition create a new surname whilst in the meantime the original of the family be totally lose there be so great liberty take in these mutation that i have not in my time see any one advance by fortune to any extraordinary condition who have not presently have genealogical title add to him new and unknown to hi father and who have not be inoculate into some illustrious stem by good luck and the obscure family be the most apt for falsification how many gentleman have we in france who by their own account be of royal extraction more i think than who will confess they be not wa it not a pleasant passage of a friend of mine there be several gentleman assemble together about the dispute of one seigneur with another which other have in truth some preeminence of title and alliance above the ordinary gentry upon the debate of this prerogative every one to make himself equal to him allege this one extraction that another this the near resemblance of name that of arm another an old wormeaten patent the very least of them be greatgrandchild to some foreign king when they come to sit down to dinner my friend instead of take hi place amongst them retire with most profound conge entreat the company to excuse him for have hitherto live with them at the saucy rate of a companion but be now well inform of their quality he would begin to pay them the respect due to their birth and grandeur and that it would ill become him to sit down among so many princesending this farce with a thousand reproach let u in god name satisfy ourselves with what our father be content with with what we be we be great enough if we rightly understand how to maintain it let u not disown the fortune and condition of our ancestor and let u lay aside these ridiculous pretence that can never be want to any one that have the impudence to allege them arm have no more security than surname i bear azure powder with trefoil or with a lion paw of the same armed gules in fesse what privilege have this to continue particularly in my house a soninlaw will transport it into another family or some paltry purchaser will make them hi first arm there be nothing wherein there be more change and confusion but this consideration lead me perforce into another subject let u pry a little narrowly into and in god name examine upon what foundation we erect this glory and reputation for which the world be turn topsyturvy wherein do we place this renown that we hunt after with so much pain it be in the end peter or william that carry it take it into hi possession and whom it only concern o what a valiant faculty be hope that in a mortal subject and in a moment make nothing of usurp infinity immensity eternity and of supply it master indigence at it pleasure with all thing he can imagine or desire nature have give u this passion for a pretty toy to play withal and this peter or william what be it but a sound when all be do or three or four dash with a pen so easy to be vary that i would fain know to whom be to be attribute the glory of so many victory to guesquin to glesquin or to gueaquin and yet there would be something of great moment in the case than in lucian that sigma should serve tau with a process for the chase be there in very good earnest the question be which of these letter be to be reward for so many siege battle wound imprisonment and service do to the crown of france by this famous constable nicholas denisot never concern himself far than the letter of hi name of which he have alter the whole contexture to build up by anagram the count dalsinois whom he have handsomely endow with the glory of hi poetry and paint the historian suetonius be satisfy with only the meaning of hi name which make him cashier hi father surname lenis to leave tranquillus successor to the reputation of hi writing who would believe that captain bayard should have no honour but what he derive from the deed of peter terrail and that antonio iscalin should suffer himself to hi face to be rob of the honour of so many navigation and command at sea and land by captain paulin and the baron de la garde secondly these be dash of the pen common to a thousand people how many be there in every family of the same name and surname and how many more in several family age and country history tell u of three of the name of socrates of five plato of eight aristotle of seven xenophon of twenty demetrii and of twenty theodores and how many more she be not acquaint with we may imagine who hinders my groom from call himself pompey the great but after all what virtue what authority or what secret spring be there that fix upon my deceased groom or the other pompey who have hi head cut off in egypt this glorious renown and these so much honoured flourish of the pen so a to be of any advantage to them what sense have the two companion in great esteem amongst me epaminondas of this fine verse that have be so many age current in hi praise or africanus of this other survivor indeed tickle themselves with these fine phrase and by them incite to jealousy and desire inconsiderately and accord to their own fancy attribute to the dead this their own feeling vainly flatter themselves that they shall one day in turn be capable of the same character however well say this verse such a would improve this argument and condemn the oversight of our leader in not push home the victory at moncontour or accuse the king of spain of not know how to make the best use of the advantage he have against u at st quentin may conclude these oversight to proceed from a soul already drink with success or from a spirit which be full and overgorge with this beginning of good fortune have lose the appetite of add to it already have enough to do to digest what it have take in he have hi arm full and can embrace no more unworthy of the benefit fortune have confer upon him and the advantage she have put into hi hand for what utility do he reap from it if notwithstanding he give hi enemy respite to rally and make head against him what hope be there that he will dare at another time to attack an enemy reunite and recomposed and arm anew with anger and revenge who do not dare to pursue them when rout and unman by fear but withal what good opportunity can he expect than that he have lose ti not here a in fence where the most hit gain the prize for so long a the enemy be on foot the game be new to begin and that be not to be call a victory that put not an end to the war in the encounter where caesar have the bad near the city of oricum he reproach pompey soldier that he have be lose have their general know how to overcome and afterwards claw him in a very different fashion when it come to hi turn but why may not a man also argue on the contrary that it be the effect of a precipitous and insatiate spirit not to know how to bind and restrain it coveting that it be to abuse the favour of god to exceed the measure he have prescribe them and that again to throw a man self into danger after a victory obtain be again to expose himself to the mercy of fortune that it be one of the great discretion in the rule of war not to drive an enemy to despair sylla and marius in the social war have defeat the marsians see yet a body of reserve that prompt by despair be come on like enraged brute to dash in upon them think it not convenient to stand their charge have not monsieur de foixs ardour transport him so furiously to pursue the remains of the victory of ravenna he have not obscure it by hi own death and yet the recent memory of hi example serve to preserve monsieur danguien from the same misfortune at the battle of serisoles ti dangerous to attack a man you have deprive of all mean to escape but by hi arm for necessity teach violent resolution this be it that make pharax withhold the king of lacedaemon who have win a battle against the mantineans from go to charge a thousand argians who have escape in an entire body from the defeat but rather let them steal off at liberty that he might not encounter valour whet and enrage by mischance clodomir king of aquitaine after hi victory pursue gondemar king of burgundy beaten and make off as fast a he could for safety compel him to face about and make head wherein hi obstinacy deprive him of the fruit of hi conquest for he there lose hi life in like manner if a man be to choose whether he would have hi soldier richly and sumptuously accoutre or arm only for the necessity of the matter in hand this argument would step in to favour the first of which opinion be sertorius philopcemen brutus caesar and other that it be to a soldier an enflaming of courage and a spur himself in brave attire and withal a motive to be more obstinate in fight have hi arm which be in a manner hi estate and whole inheritance to defend which be the reason say xenophon why those of asia carry their wife and concubine with their choicest jewel and great wealth along with them to the war but then these argument would be a ready to stand up for the other side that a general ought rather to lessen in hi men their solicitude of preserve themselves than to increase it that by such mean they will be in a double fear of hazard their person a it will be a double temptation to the enemy to fight with great resolution where so great booty and so rich spoil be to be obtain and this very thing have be observe in former time notably to encourage the roman against the samnite antiochus shew hannibal the army he have raise wonderfully splendid and rich in all sort of equipage ask him if the roman would be satisfy with that army satisfied reply the other yes doubtless be their avarice never so great lycurgus not only forbid hi soldier all manner of bravery in their equipage but moreover to strip their conquered enemy because he would a he say that poverty and frugality should shine with the rest of the battle at siege and elsewhere where occasion draw u near to the enemy we willingly suffer our men to brave rate and affront him with all sort of injurious language and not without some colour of reason for it be of no little consequence to take from them all hope of mercy and composition by represent to them that there be no fair quarter to be expect from an enemy they have incense to that degree nor other remedy remain but in victory and yet vitellius find himself deceive in this way of proceed for have to do with otho weaker in the valour of hi soldier long unaccustomed to war and effeminated with the delight of the city he so nettle them at last with injurious language reproach them with cowardice and regret for the mistress and entertainment they have leave behind at rome that by this mean he inspire them with such resolution a no exhortation have have the power to have do and himself make them fall upon him with whom their own captain before could by no mean prevail and indeed when they be injury that touch to the quick it may very well fall out that he who go but unwillingly to work in the behalf of hi prince will fall tot with another sort of mettle when the quarrel be hi own considering of how great importance be the preservation of the general of an army and that the universal aim of an enemy be level directly at the head upon which all the other depend the course seem to admit of no dispute which we know have be take by so many great captain of change their habit and disguise their person upon the point of go to engage nevertheless the inconvenience a man by so do run into be not less than that he think to avoid for the captain by this mean be conceal from the knowledge of hi own men the courage they should derive from hi presence and example happens by degree to cool and to decay and not see the wonted mark and ensign of their leader they presently conclude him either dead or that despair of the business he be go to shift for himself and experience show u that both these way have be successful and otherwise what befell pyrrhus in the battle he fight against the consul levinus in italy will serve u to both purpose for though by shroud hi person under the armour of megacles and make him wear hi own he undoubtedly preserve hi own life yet by that very mean he be withal very near run into the other mischief of lose the battle alexander caesar and lucullus love to make themselves know in a battle by rich accoutrement and armour of a particular lustre and colour agis agesilaus and that great gilippus on the contrary use to fight obscurely arm and without any imperial attendance or distinction amongst other oversight pompey be charge withal at the battle of pharsalia he be condemn for make hi army stand still to receive the enemys charge by reason that i shall here steal plutarch own word which be good than mine he by so do deprive himself of the violent impression the motion of run add to the first shock of arm and hinder that clashing of the combatant against one another which be wont to give them great impetuosity and fury especially when they come to rush in with their utmost vigour their courage increase by the shout and the career ti to render the soldier ardour a a man may say more reserved and cold this be what he say but if caesar have come by the bad why might it not as well have be urge by another that on the contrary the strong and most steady posture of fighting be that wherein a man stand planted firm without motion and that they who be steady upon the march closing up and reserve their force within themselves for the push of the business have a great advantage against those who be disorder and who have already spend half their breath in run on precipitately to the charge besides that an army be a body make up of so many individual member it be impossible for it to move in this fury with so exact a motion a not to break the order of battle and that the best of them be not engage before their fellow can come on to help them in that unnatural battle betwixt the two persian brother the lacedaemonian clearchus who command the greek of cyrus party lead them on softly and without precipitation to the charge but come within fifty pace hurry them on full speed hop in so short a career both to keep their order and to husband their breath and at the same time to give the advantage of impetuosity and impression both to their person and their missile arm other have regulate this question a to their army thus if your enemy come full drive upon you stand firm to receive him if he stand to receive you run full drive upon him in the expedition of the emperor charles v into provence king francis be put to choose either to go meet him in italy or to await him in hi own dominion wherein though he very well consider of how great advantage it be to preserve hi own territory entire and clear from the trouble of war to the end that be unexhausted of it store it might continually supply men and money at need that the necessity of war require at every turn to spoil and lay waste the country before u which can not very well be do upon one own to which may be add that the country people do not so easily digest such a havoc by those of their own party a from an enemy so that sedition and commotion might by such mean be kindle amongst u that the licence of pillage and plunder which be not to be tolerate at home be a great ease and refreshment against the fatigue and suffering of war and that he who have no other prospect of gain than hi bare pay will hardly be keep from run home be but two step from hi wife and hi own house that he who lay the cloth be ever at the charge of the feast that there be more alacrity in assault than defend and that the shock of a battles loss in our own bowel be so violent a to endanger the disjointing of the whole body there be no passion so contagious a that of fear that be so easily believe or that so suddenly diffuse itself and that the city that should hear the rattle of this tempest at their gate that should take in their captain and soldier yet tremble and out of breath would be in danger in this heat and hurry to precipitate themselves upon some untoward resolution notwithstanding all this so it be that he choose to recall the force he have beyond the mountain and to suffer the enemy to come to him for he might on the other hand imagine that be at home and amongst hi friend he could not fail of plenty of all manner of convenience the river and pass he have at hi devotion would bring him in both provision and money in all security and without the trouble of convoy that he should find hi subject by so much the more affectionate to him by how much their danger be more near and press that have so many city and barrier to secure him it would be in hi power to give the law of battle at hi own opportunity and advantage and that if it please him to delay the time under cover and at hi ease he might see hi enemy founder and defeat himself with the difficulty he be certain to encounter be engage in a hostile country where before behind and on every side war would be make upon him no mean to refresh himself or to enlarge hi quarter should diseases infest them or to lodge hi wounded men in safety no money no victual but at the point of the lance no leisure to repose and take breath no knowledge of the way or country to secure him from ambush and surprise and in case of lose a battle no possible mean of save the remains neither be there want of example in both these case scipio think it much well to go and attack hi enemy territory in africa than to stay at home to defend hi own and to fight him in italy and it succeed well with him but on the contrary hannibal in the same war ruin himself by abandon the conquest of a foreign country to go and defend hi own the athenian have leave the enemy in their own dominion to go over into sicily be not favour by fortune in their design but agathocles king of syracuse find her favourable to him when he go over into africa and leave the war at home by which examples we be wont to conclude and with some reason that event especially in war for the most part depend upon fortune who will not be govern by nor submit unto human reason and prudence accord to the poet but to take the thing right it should seem that our counsel and deliberation depend a much upon fortune a anything els we do and that she engage also our argument in her uncertainty and confusion we argue rashly and adventurously say timaeus in plato by reason that as well a ourselves our discourse have great participation in the temerity of chance i here have become a grammarian i who never learn any language but by rote and who do not yet know adjective conjunction or ablative i think i have read that the roman have a sort of horse by them call funales or dextrarios which be either lead horse or horse lay on at several stage to be take fresh upon occasion and thence it be that we call our horse of service destriers and our romance commonly use the phrase of adestrer for accompagner to accompany they also call those that be train in such sort that run full speed side by side without bridle or saddle the roman gentleman arm at all piece would shift and throw themselves from one to the other desultorios equos the numidian menatarms have always a led horse in one hand besides that they ride upon to change in the heat of battle there be many horse train to help their rider so a to run upon any one that appear with a drawn sword to fall both with mouth and heel upon any that front or oppose them but it often happen that they do more harm to their friend than to their enemy and moreover you can not loose them from their hold to reduce them again into order when they be once engage and grapple by which mean you remain at the mercy of their quarrel it happen very ill to artybius general of the persian army fight man to man with onesilus king of salami to be mount upon a horse train after this manner it be the occasion of hi death the squire of onesilus cleave the horse down with a scythe betwixt the shoulder a it be rear up upon hi master and what the italian report that in the battle of fornova the horse of charles viii with kick and plunge disengage hi master from the enemy that press upon him without which he have be slain sound like a very great chance if it be true the mamalukes make their boast that they have the most ready horse of any cavalry in the world that by nature and custom they be teach to know and distinguish the enemy and to fall foul upon them with mouth and heel accord to a word or sign give a also to gather up with their teeth dart and lance scatter upon the field and present them to their rider on the word of command t be say both of caesar and pompey that amongst their other excellent quality they be both very good horseman and particularly of caesar that in hi youth be mount on the bare back without saddle or bridle he could make the horse run stop and turn and perform all it air with hi hand behind him a nature design to make of this person and of alexander two miracle of military art so one would say she have do her utmost to arm them after an extraordinary manner for every one know that alexander horse bucephalus have a head incline to the shape of a bull that he would suffer himself to be mount and govern by none but hi master and that he be so honoured after hi death a to have a city erect to hi name caesar have also one which have forefoot like those of a man hi hoof be divide in the form of finger which likewise be not to be ride by any but caesar himself who after hi death dedicate hi statue to the goddess venus i do not willingly alight when i be once on horseback for it be the place where whether well or sick i find myself most at ease plato recommend it for health a also pliny say it be good for the stomach and the joint let u go far into this matter since here we be we read in xenophon a law forbid any one who be master of a horse to travel on foot trogus pompeius and justin say that the parthian be wont to perform all office and ceremony not only in war but also all affair whether public or private make bargain confer entertain take the air and all on horseback and that the great distinction betwixt freeman and slave amongst them be that the one rode on horseback and the other go on foot an institution of which king cyrus be the founder there be several example in the roman history and suetonius more particularly observe it of caesar of captain who on press occasion command their cavalry to alight both by that mean to take from them all hope of flight a also for the advantage they hop in this sort of fight say livy and so the first thing they do to prevent the mutiny and insurrection of nation of late conquest be to take from them their arm and horse and therefore it be that we so often meet in caesar the grand signior to this day suffer not a christian or a jew to keep a horse of hi own throughout hi empire our ancestor and especially at the time they have war with the english in all their great engagement and pitch battle fight for the most part on foot that they might have nothing but their own force courage and constancy to trust to in a quarrel of so great concern a life and honour you stake whatever chrysanthes in xenophon say to the contrary your valour and your fortune upon that of your horse hi wound or death bring your person into the same danger hi fear or fury shall make you repute rash or cowardly if he have an ill mouth or will not answer to the spur your honour must answer for it and therefore i do not think it strange that those battle be more firm and furious than those that be fight on horseback their battle be much well dispute nowadays there be nothing but rout and the mean we choose to make use of in so great a hazard should be as much a possible at our own command wherefore i should advise to choose weapon of the short sort and such of which we be able to give the best account a man may repose more confidence in a sword he hold in hi hand than in a bullet he discharge out of a pistol wherein there must be a concurrence of several circumstance to make it perform it office the powder the stone and the wheel if any of which fail it endanger your fortune a man himself strike much sure than the air can direct hi blow but of that weapon i shall speak more fully when i come to compare the arm of the ancient with those of modern use only by the way the astonishment of the ear abate which every one grow familiar with in a short time i look upon it a a weapon of very little execution and hope we shall one day lay it aside that missile weapon which the italian formerly make use of both with fire and by sling be much more terrible they call a certain kind of javelin arm at the point with an iron three foot long that it might pierce through and through an arm man phalarica which they sometimes in the field dart by hand sometimes from several sort of engine for the defence of beleaguered place the shaft be roll round with flax wax rosin oil and other combustible matter take fire in it flight and light upon the body of a man or hi target take away all the use of arm and limb and yet come to close fight i should think they would also damage the assailant and that the camp be a it be plant with these flaming truncheon would produce a common inconvenience to the whole crowd they have moreover other device which custom make them perfect in which seem incredible to u who have not see them by which they supply the effect of our powder and shot they dart their

arrow so long that take them up one might return them back like a dart and with them pierce a buckler and an arm man through and through the engine that dionysius invent at syracuse to shoot vast massy dart and stone of a prodigious greatness with so great impetuosity and at so great a distance come very near to our modern invention but in this discourse of horse and horsemanship we be not to forget the pleasant posture of one maistre pierre pol a doctor of divinity upon hi mule whom monstrelet report always to have ride sideways through the street of paris like a woman he say also elsewhere that the gascons have terrible horse that would wheel in their full speed which the french picards fleming and brabanters look upon a a miracle have never see the like before which be hi very word caesar speaking of the suabians in the charge they make on horseback say he they often throw themselves off to fight on foot have teach their horse not to stir in the meantime from the place to which they presently run again upon occasion and accord to their custom nothing be so unmanly and so base a to use saddle or pad and they despise such a make use of those convenience insomuch that be but a very few in number they fear not to attack a great many that which i have formerly wonder at to see a horse make to perform all hi air with a switch only and the rein upon hi neck be common with the massilians who rid their horse without saddle or bridle king alfonso he who first institute the order of the band or scarf in spain amongst other rule of the order give them this that they should never ride mule or mulet upon penalty of a mark of silver this i have lately out of guevara letter whoever give these the title of golden epistle have another kind of opinion of them than i have the courtier say that till hi time it be a disgrace to a gentleman to ride on one of these creature but the abyssinian on the contrary the nearer they be to the person of prester john love to be mount upon large mule for the great dignity and grandeur xenophon tell u that the assyrian be fain to keep their horse fetter in the stable they be so fierce and vicious and that it require so much time to loose and harness them that to avoid any disorder this tedious preparation might bring upon them in case of surprise they never sit down in their camp till it be first well fortify with ditch and ramparts hi cyrus who be so great a master in all manner of horse service keep hi horse to their due work and never suffer them to have anything to eat till first they have earn it by the sweat of some kind of exercise the scythian when in the field and in scarcity of provision use to let their horse blood which they drink and sustain themselves by that diet those of crete be besiege by metellus be in so great necessity for drink that they be fain to quench their thirst with their horse urine to shew how much cheap the turkish army support themselves than our european force ti say that besides the soldier drink nothing but water and eat nothing but rice and salt flesh pulverise of which every one may easily carry about with him a month provision they know how to fee upon the blood of their horse as well a the muscovite and tartar and salt it for their use these newdiscovered people of the indie when the spaniard first land amongst them have so great an opinion both of the men and horse that they look upon the first a god and the other a animal ennoble above their nature insomuch that after they be subdue come to the men to sue for peace and pardon and to bring them gold and provision they fail not to offer of the same to the horse with the same kind of harangue to them they have make to the other interpret their neighing for a language of truce and friendship in the other indie to ride upon an elephant be the first and royal place of honour the second to ride in a coach with four horse the third to ride upon a camel and the last and least honour to be carry or draw by one horse only some one of our late writer tell u that he have be in country in those part where they ride upon ox with pad stirrup and bridle and very much at their ease quintus fabius maximus rullianus in a battle with the samnite see hi horse after three or four charge have fail of break into the enemys battalion take this course to make them unbridle all their horse and spur

russia be overwhelm with so dreadful a tempest of snow that to shelter and preserve themselves from the cold many kill and embowelled their horse to creep into their belly and enjoy the benefit of that vital heat bajazet after that furious battle wherein he be overthrow by tamerlane be in a hopeful way of secure hi own person by the fleetness of an arabian mare he have under him have he not be constrain to let her drink her fill at the ford of a river in hi way which render her so heavy and indispose that he be afterwards easily overtake by those that pursue him they say indeed that to let a horse stale take him off hi mettle but a to drink i should rather have think it would refresh him croesus march hi army through certain waste land near sardis meet with an infinite number of serpent which the horse devour with great appetite and which herodotus say be a prodigy of ominous portent to hi affair we call a horse entire that have hi mane and ear so and no other will pass muster the lacedaemonians have defeat the athenian in sicily return triumphant from the victory into the city of syracuse amongst other insolence cause all the horse they have take to be shorn and lead in triumph alexander fought with a nation call dahas whose discipline it be to march two and two together arm on one horse to the war and be in fight one of them alight and so they fight on horseback and on foot one after another by turn i do not think that for graceful rid any nation in the world excel the french a good horseman accord to our way of speak seem rather to have respect to the courage of the man than address in rid of all that ever i saw the most knowing in that art who have the best seat and the best method in break horse be monsieur de carnavalet who serve our king henry ii i have see a man ride with both hi foot upon the saddle take off hi saddle and at hi return take it up again and replace it rid all the while full speed have gallop over a cap make at it very good shot backwards with hi bow take up anything from the ground set one foot on the ground and the other in the stirrup with twenty other ape trick which he get hi living by there have be see in my time at constantinople two men upon one horse who in the height of it speed would throw themselves off and into the saddle again by turn and one who bridle and saddle hi horse with nothing but hi teeth an other who betwixt two horse one foot upon one saddle and the other upon another carry the other man upon hi shoulder would ride full career the other stand bolt upright upon and make very good shot with hi bow several who would ride full speed with their heel upward and their head upon the saddle betwixt several scimitar with the point upwards fix in the harness when i be a boy the prince of sulmona rid an unbroken horse at naples prone to all sort of action hold real under hi knee and toe a if they have be nail there to shew the firmness of hi seat i should willingly pardon our people for admit no other pattern or rule of perfection than their own peculiar manner and custom for ti a common vice not of the vulgar only but almost of all men to walk in the beaten road their ancestor have tread before them i be content when they see fabricius or laelius that they look upon their countenance and behaviour a barbarous see they be neither clothed nor fashioned accord to our mode but i find fault with their singular indiscretion in suffer themselves to be so blinded and impose upon by the authority of the present usage a every month to alter their opinion if custom so require and that they should so vary their judgment in their own particular concern when they wear the busk of their doublet up as high a their breast they stiffly maintain that they be in their proper place some year after it be slip down betwixt their thigh and then they could laugh at the former fashion a uneasy and intolerable the fashion now in use make them absolutely condemn the other two with so great resolution and so universal consent that a man would think there be a certain kind of madness crept in amongst them that infatuate their understanding to this strange degree now see that our change of fashion be so prompt and sudden that the invention of all the tailor in the world can not furnish out new whimwhams enow to fee our vanity withal there will often be a necessity that the despised form must again come in vogue these immediately after fall into the same contempt and that the same judgment must in the space of fifteen or twenty year take up halfadozen not only diver but contrary opinion with an incredible lightness and inconstancy there be not any of u so discreet who suffer not himself to be gull with this contradiction and both in external and internal sight to be insensibly blind i wish to muster up here some old custom that i have in memory some of them the same with ours the other different to the end that bearing in mind this continual variation of human thing we may have our judgment more clearly and firmly settle the thing in use amongst u of fight with rapier and cloak be in practice amongst the roman also say caesar and he observe a vicious custom of our nation that continue yet amongst u which be to stop passenger we meet upon the road to compel them to give an account who they be and to take it for an affront and just cause of quarrel if they refuse to do it at the bath which the ancient make use of every day before they go to dinner and as frequently a we wash our hand they at first only bath their arm and leg but afterwards and by a custom that have continue for many age in most nation of the world they bath stark naked in mixed and perfumed water look upon it a a great simplicity to bathe in mere water the most delicate and affect perfume themselves all over three or four time a day they often cause their hair to be pinch off a the woman of france have some time since take up a custom to do their forehead though they have ointment proper for that purpose they delight to lie soft and allege it a a great testimony of hardiness to lie upon a mattress they eat lie upon bed much after the manner of the turk in this age and ti say of the young cato that after the battle of pharsalia be enter into a melancholy disposition at the ill posture of the public affair he take hi repast always sit assume a strict and austere course of life it be also their custom to kiss the hand of great person the more to honour and caress them and meet with friend they always kiss in salutation a do the venetian in petition or salute any great man they use to lay their hand upon hi knee pasicles the philosopher brother of crate instead of lay hi hand upon the knee lay it upon the private part and be roughly repulse by him to whom he make that indecent compliment what say he be not that part your own as well a the other they use to eat fruit a we do after dinner they wipe their fundament let the lady if they please mince it small with a sponge which be the reason that spongia be a smutty word in latin which sponge be fasten to the end of a stick a appear by the story of him who a he be lead along to be throw to the wild beast in the sight of the people ask leave to do hi business and have no other way to despatch himself force the sponge and stick down hi throat and choke himself they use to wipe after coition with perfumed wool they have in the street of rome vessel and little tub for passenger to urine in they have collation betwixt meal and have in summer cellar of snow to cool their wine and some there be who make use of snow in winter not think their wine cool enough even at that cold season of the year the men of quality have their cupbearer and carver and their buffoon to make them sport they have their meat serve up in winter upon chafe dish which be set upon the table and have portable kitchen of which i myself have see some wherein all their service be carry about with them in summer they have a contrivance to bring fresh and clear rill through their low room wherein be great store of live fish which the guest take out with their own hand to be dress every man accord to hi own liking fish have ever have this preeminence and keep it still that the grandee a to them all pretend to be cook and indeed the taste be more delicate than that of flesh at least to my fancy but in all sort of magnificence debauchery and voluptuous invention of effeminacy and expense we do in truth all we can to parallel them for our will be as corrupt a theirs but we want ability to equal them our force be no more able to reach them in their vicious than in their virtuous quality for both the one and the other proceed from a vigour of soul which be without comparison great in them than in u and souls by how much the weaker they be by so much have they less power to do either very well or very ill the high place of honour amongst them be the middle the name go before or follow after either in writing or speaking have no signification of grandeur a be evident by their writing they will a soon say oppius and caesar a caesar and oppius and me and thee a thee and me this be the reason that make me formerly take notice in the life of flaminius in our french plutarch of one passage where it seem a if the author speaking of the jealousy of honour betwixt the aetolians and roman about the winning of a battle they have with their joined force obtain make it of some importance that in the greek song they have put the aetolians before the roman if there be no amphibology in the word of the french translation the lady in their bath make no scruple of admit men amongst them and moreover make use of their servingmen to rub and anoint them they all powder themselves with a certain powder to moderate their sweat the ancient gaul say sidonius apollinaris wear their hair long before and the hind part of the head shave a fashion that begin to revive in this vicious and effeminate age the roman use to pay the waterman their fare at their first stepping into the boat which we never do till after land the woman use to lie on the side of the bed next the wall and for that reason they call caesar they take breath in their drinking and water their wine and the roguish look and gesture of our lackey be also in use amongst them the argian and roman lady mourn in white a ours do formerly and should do still be i to govern in this point but there be whole book on this subject the judgment be an utensil proper for all subject and will have an oar in everything which be the reason that in these essay i take hold of all occasion where though it happen to be a subject i do not very well understand i try however sound it at a distance and find it too deep for my stature i keep me on the shore and this knowledge that a man can proceed no further be one effect of it virtue yes one of those of which it be most proud one while in an idle and frivolous subject i try to find out matter whereof to compose a body and then to prop and support it another while i employ it in a noble subject one that have be toss and tumble by a thousand hand wherein a man can scarce possibly introduce anything of hi own the way be so beat on every side that he must of necessity walk in the step of another in such a case ti the work of the judgment to take the way that seem best and of a thousand path to determine that this or that be the best i leave the choice of my argument to fortune and take that she first present to me they be all alike to me i never design to go through any of them for i never see all of anything neither do they who so largely promise to show it other of a hundred member and face that everything have i take one onewhile to look it over only another while to ripple up the skin and sometimes to pinch it to the bone i give a stab not so wide but as deep a i can and be for the most part tempt to take it in hand by some new light i discover in it did i know myself less i might perhaps venture to handle something or other to the bottom and to be deceive in my own inability but sprinkle here one word and there another pattern cut from several piece and scatter without design and without engage myself too far i be not responsible for them or oblige to keep close to my subject without vary at my own liberty and pleasure and give up myself to doubt and uncertainty and to my own governing method ignorance all motion discover u the very same soul of caesar that make itself so conspicuous in marshal and command the battle of pharsalia be also see a solicitous and busy in the soft affair of love and leisure a man make a judgment of a horse not only by see him when he be show off hi pace but by hi very walk nay and by see him stand in the stable amongst the function of the soul there be some of a low and meaner form he who do not see her in those inferior office as well a in those of noble note never fully discover her and peradventure she be best show where she move her simple pace the wind of passion take most hold of her in her high flight and the rather by reason that she wholly apply herself to and exercise her whole virtue upon every particular subject and never handle more than one thing at a time and that not accord to it but accord to herself thing in respect to themselves have peradventure their weight measure and condition but when we once take them into u the soul form them a she please death be terrible to cicero covet by cato indifferent to socrates health conscience authority knowledge rich beauty and their contrary all strip themselves at their entering into u and receive a new robe and of another fashion from the soul and of what colour brown bright green dark and of what quality sharp sweet deep or superficial a best plea each of them for they be not agree upon any common standard of form rule or proceeding every one be a queen in her own dominion let u therefore no more excuse ourselves upon the external quality of thing it belong to u to give ourselves an account of them our good or ill have no other dependence but on ourselves ti there that our offering and our vow be due and not to fortune she have no power over our manner on the contrary they draw and make her follow in their train and cast her in their own mould why should not i judge of alexander at table ranting and drinking at the prodigious rate he sometimes use to do or if he play at chess what string of hi soul be not touch by this idle and childish game i hate and avoid it because it be not play enough that it be too grave and serious a diversion and i be ashamed to lay out a much thought and study upon it a would serve to much good use he do not more pump hi brain about hi glorious expedition into the indie nor than another in unravel a passage upon which depend the safety of mankind to what a degree do this ridiculous diversion molest the soul when all her faculty be summon together upon this trivial account and how fair an opportunity she herein give every one to know and to make a right judgment of himself i do not more thoroughly sift myself in any other posture than this what passion be we exempt from in it anger spite malice impatience and a vehement desire of get the good in a concern wherein it be more excusable to be ambitious of be overcome for to be eminent to excel above the common rate in frivolous thing nowise befit a man of honour what i say in this example may be say in all other every particle every employment of man manifest him equally with any other democritus and heraclitus be two philosopher of whom the first finding human condition ridiculous and vain never appear abroad but with a jeering and laugh countenance whereas heraclitus commiserate that same condition of ours appear always with a sorrowful look and tear in hi eye i be clearly for the first humour not because it be more pleasant to laugh than to weep but because it express more contempt and condemnation than the other and i think we can never be despise accord to our full desert compassion and bewail seem to imply some esteem of and value for the thing bemoan whereas the thing we laugh at be by that express to be of no moment i do not think that we be so unhappy a we be vain or have in u so much malice a folly we be not so full of mischief a inanity nor so miserable a we be vile and mean and therefore diogenes who pass away hi time in roll himself in hi tub and make nothing of the great alexander esteem u no good than fly or bladder puff up with wind be a sharp and more penetrating and consequently in my opinion a juster judge than timon surnamed the manhater for what a man hat he lay to heart this last be an enemy to all mankind who passionately desire our ruin and avoid our conversation a dangerous proceed from wicked and deprave nature the other value u so little that we could neither trouble nor infect him by our example and leave u to herd one with another not out of fear but from contempt of our society conclude u a incapable of do good a evil of the same strain be statilius answer when brutus court him into the conspiracy against caesar he be satisfy that the enterprise be just but he do not think mankind worthy of a wise man concern accord to the doctrine of hegesias who say that a wise man ought to do nothing but for himself forasmuch a he only be worthy of it and to the saying of theodorus that it be not reasonable a wise man should hazard himself for hi country and endanger wisdom for a company of fool our condition be as ridiculous a risible a rhetorician of time past say that to make little thing appear great be hi profession this be a shoemaker who can make a great shoe for a little foot they would in sparta have send such a fellow to be whip for make profession of a tricky and deceitful act and i fancy that archidamus who be king of that country be a little surprised at the answer of thucydides when inquiring of him which be the good wrestler pericles or he he reply that it be hard to affirm for when i have throw him say he he always persuade the spectator that he have no fall and carry away the prize the woman who paint pounce and plaster up their ruin fill up their wrinkle and deformity be less to blame because it be no great matter whether we see them in their natural complexion whereas these make it their business to deceive not our sight only but our judgment and to adulterate and corrupt the very essence of thing the republic that have maintain themselves in a regular and wellmodelled government such a those of lacedaemon and crete have orator in no very great esteem aristo wisely define rhetoric to be a science to persuade the people socrates and plato an art to flatter and deceive and those who deny it in the general description verify it throughout in their precept the mohammedan will not suffer their child to be instruct in it a be useless and the athenian perceiving of how pernicious consequence the practice of it be it be in their city of universal esteem order the principal part which be to move the affection with their exordium and peroration to be take away ti an engine invent to manage and govern a disorderly and tumultuous rabble and that never be make use of but like physic to the sick in a discomposed state in those where the vulgar or the ignorant or both together have be allpowerful and able to give the law a in those of athens rhodes and rome and where the public affair have be in a continual tempest of commotion to such place have the orator always repair and in truth we shall find few person in those republic who have push their fortune to any great degree of eminence without the assistance of eloquence pompey caesar crassus lucullus lentulus metellus thence take their chiefest spring to mount to that degree of authority at which they at last arrived make it of great use to them than arm contrary to the opinion of good time for l volumnius speak publicly in favour of the election of q fabius and pub decius to the consular dignity these be men say he bear for war and great in execution in the combat of the tongue altogether want spirit truly consular the subtle eloquent and learn be only good for the city to make praetor of to administer justice eloquence most flourish at rome when the public affair be in the bad condition and most disquiet with intestine commotion a a free and untilled soil bear the bad weed by which it should seem that a monarchical government have less need of it than any other for the stupidity and facility natural to the common people and that render them subject to be turn and twin and lead by the ear by this charm harmony of word without weigh or consider the truth and reality of thing by the force of reason this facility i say be not easily find in a single person and it be also more easy by good education and advice to secure him from the impression of this poison there be never any famous orator know to come out of persia or macedon i have enter into this discourse upon the occasion of an italian i lately receive into my service and who be clerk of the kitchen to the late cardinal caraffa till hi death i put this fellow upon an account of hi office when he fell to discourse of this palatescience with such a settled countenance and magisterial gravity a if he have be handle some profound point of divinity he make a learned distinction of the several sort of appetite of that a man have before he begin to eat and of those after the second and third service the mean simply to satisfy the first and then to raise and actuate the other two the ordering of the sauce first in general and then proceed to the quality of the ingredient and their effect the difference of salad accord to their season those which ought to be serve up hot and which cold the manner of their garnishment and decoration to render them acceptable to the eye after which he enter upon the order of the whole service full of weighty and important consideration and all this set out with lofty and magnificent word the very same we make use of when we discourse of the government of an empire which learn lecture of my man bring this of terence into my memory and yet even the greek themselves very much admire and highly applaud the order and disposition that paulus aemilius observe in the feast he give them at hi return from macedon but i do not here speak of effect i speak of word only i do not know whether it may have the same operation upon other men that it have upon me but when i hear our architect thunder out their bombast word of pilaster architrave and cornice of the corinthian and doric order and suchlike jargon my imagination be presently possess with the palace of apollidon when after all i find them but the paltry piece of my own kitchen door to hear men talk of metonomies metaphor and allegory and other grammar word would not one think they signify some rare and exotic form of speaking and yet they be phrase that come near to the babble of my chambermaid and this other be a gullery of the same stamp to call the office of our kingdom by the lofty title of the roman though they have no similitude of function and still less of authority and power and this also which i doubt will one day turn to the reproach of this age of ours unworthily and indifferently to confer upon any we think fit the most glorious surname with which antiquity honour but one or two person in several age plato carry away the surname of divine by so universal a consent that never any one repine at it or attempt to take it from him and yet the italian who pretend and with good reason to more sprightly wit and sound sense than the other nation of their time have lately bestow the same title upon aretin in whose writing save tumid phrase set out with smart period ingenious indeed but farfetched and fantastic and the eloquence be it what it may i see nothing in him above the ordinary writer of hi time so far be he from approach the ancient divinity and we make nothing of give the surname of great to prince who have nothing more than ordinary in them attilius regulus general of the roman army in africa in the height of all hi glory and victory over the carthaginian write to the republic to acquaint them that a certain hind he have leave in trust with hi estate which be in all but seven acre of land have run away with all hi instrument of husbandry and entreat therefore that they would please to call him home that he might take order in hi own affair l hi wife and child should suffer by this disaster whereupon the senate appoint another to manage hi business cause hi loss to be make good and order hi family to be maintain at the public expense the elder cato return consul from spain sell hi warhorse to save the money it would have cost in bring it back by sea into italy and be governor of sardinia he make all hi visit on foot without other train than one officer of the republic who carry hi robe and a censer for sacrifice and for the most part carry hi trunk himself he brag that he have never wear a gown that cost above ten crown nor have ever send above tenpence to the market for one day provision and that a to hi country house he have not one that be roughcast on the outside scipio aemilianus after two triumph and two consulship go an embassy with no more than seven servant in hi train ti say that homer have never more than one plato three and zeno founder of the sect of stoic none at all tiberius gracchus be allow but fivepence halfpenny a day when employ a public minister about the public affair and be at that time the great man of rome if we would sometimes bestow a little consideration upon ourselves and employ the time we spend in pry into other men action and discover thing without u in examine our own ability we should soon perceive of how infirm and decay material this fabric of ours be compose be it not a singular testimony of imperfection that we can not establish our satisfaction in any one thing and that even our own fancy and desire should deprive u of the power to choose what be most proper and useful for u a very good proof of this be the great dispute that have ever be amongst the philosopher of find out man sovereign good that continue yet and will eternally continue without solution or accord whatever it be that fall into our knowledge and possession we find that it satisfy not and we still pant after thing to come and unknown inasmuch a those present do not suffice for u not that in my judgment they have not in them wherewith to do it but because we seize them with an unruly and immoderate haste our appetite be irresolute and fickle it can neither keep nor enjoy anything with a good grace and man conclude it to be the fault of the thing he be possess of fill himself with and feed upon the idea of thing he neither know nor understands to which he devote hi hope and hi desire pay them all reverence and honour accord to the saying of caesar there be a sort of little knack and frivolous subtlety from which men sometimes expect to derive reputation and applause a poet who compose whole poem with every line begin with the same letter we see the shape of egg globes wing and hatchet cut out by the ancient greek by the measure of their verse make them longer or short to represent such or such a figure of this nature be hi employment who make it hi business to compute into how many several order the letter of the alphabet might be transpose and find out that incredible number mention in plutarch i be mightily please with the humour of him who have a man bring before him that have learn to throw a grain of millet with such dexterity and assurance as never to miss the eye of a needle and be afterwards entreat to give something for the reward of so rare a performance he pleasantly and in my opinion justly order a certain number of bushel of the same grain to be deliver to him that he might not want wherewith to exercise so famous an art ti a strong evidence of a weak judgment when men approve of thing for their be rare and new or for their difficulty where worth and usefulness be

stupidity and wisdom meet in the same centre of sentiment and resolution in the suffering of human accident the wise control and triumph over ill the other know it not these last be a a man may say on this side of accident the other be beyond them who after have well weigh and consider their quality measure and judge them what they be by virtue of a vigorous soul leap out of their reach they

for my own part retreat as much a i can towards the first and natural station whence i so vainly attempt to advance popular and purely natural poesy have in it certain artless grace by which she may come into comparison with the great beauty of poetry perfect by art a we see in our gascon villanels and the song that be bring u from nation that have no knowledge of any manner of science nor so much a the use of write the middle sort of poesy betwixt these two be despise of no value honour or esteem but see that the path once lay open to the fancy i have find a it commonly fall out that what we have take for a difficult exercise and a rare subject prove to be nothing so and that after the invention be once warm it find out an infinite number of parallel example i shall only add this onethat be these essay of mine considerable enough to deserve a critical judgment it might then i think fall out that they would not much take with common and vulgar capacity nor be very acceptable to the singular and excellent sort of men the first would not understand them enough and the last too much and so they may hover in the middle region it have be report of some a of alexander the great that their sweat exhale an odoriferous smell occasion by some rare and extraordinary constitution of which plutarch and other have be inquisitive into the cause but the ordinary constitution of human body be quite otherwise and their best and chief excellency be to be exempt from smell nay the sweetness even of the pure breath have nothing in it of great perfection than to be without any offensive smell like those of healthful child which make plautus say of a woman and such a make use of fine exotic perfume be with good reason to be suspect of some natural imperfection which they endeavour by these odour to conceal to smell though well be to stink and elsewhere i be nevertheless a great lover of good smell and as much abominate the ill one which also i scent at a great distance i think than other men of smell the simple and natural seem to me the most pleasing let the lady look to that for ti chiefly their concern amid the most profound barbarism the scythian woman after bath be wont to powder and crust their face and all their body with a certain odoriferous drug grow in their country which be cleanse off when they come to have familiarity with men they be find perfume and sleek ti not to be believe how strangely all sort of odour cleave to me and how apt my skin be to imbibe them he that complain of nature that she have not furnish mankind with a vehicle to convey smell to the nose have no reason for they will do it themselves especially to me my very mustachios which be full perform that office for if i stroke them but with my glove or handkerchief the smell will not out a whole day they manifest where i have be and the close luscious devour viscid melt kiss of youthful ardour in my wanton age leave a sweetness upon my lip for several hour after and yet i have ever find myself little subject to epidemic disease that be catch either by converse with the sick or breed by the contagion of the air and have escape from those of my time of which there have be several sort in our city and army we read of socrates that though he never depart from athens during the frequent plague that infest the city he only be never infect physician might i believe extract great utility from odours than they do for i have often observe that they cause an alteration in me and work upon my spirit accord to their several virtue which make me approve of what be say that the use of incense and perfume in church so ancient and so universally receive in all nation and religion be intend to cheer u and to rouse and purify the sens the good to fit u for contemplation i could have be glad the good to judge of it to have taste the culinary art of those cook who have so rare a way of season exotic odour with the relish of meat a it be particularly observe in the service of the king of tunis who in our day land at naples to have an interview with charles the emperor hi dish be lard with odoriferous drug to that degree of expense that the cookery of one peacock and two pheasant amount to a hundred ducat to dress them after their fashion and when the carver come to cut them up not only the diningroom but all the apartment of hi palace and the adjoin street be fill with an aromatic vapour which do not presently vanish my chiefest care in choose my lodging be always to avoid a thick and stink air and those beautiful city venice and paris very much lessen the kindness i have for them the one by the offensive smell of her marsh and the other of her dirt i propose formless and undetermined fancy like those who publish doubtful question to be after a disputed upon in the school not to establish truth but to seek it and i submit them to the judgment of those whose office it be to regulate not my writing and action only but moreover my very thoughts let what i here set down meet with correction or applause it shall be of equal welcome and utility to me myself beforehand condemn a absurd and impious if anything shall be find through ignorance or inadvertency couch in this rhapsody contrary to the holy resolution and prescription of the catholic apostolic and roman church into which i be bear and in which i will die and yet always submit to the authority of their censure which have an absolute power over me i thus rashly venture at everything a in treat upon this present subject i know not if or no i be wrong but since by a particular favour of the divine bounty a certain form of prayer have be prescribe and dictate to u word by word from the mouth of god himself i have ever be of opinion that we ought to have it in more frequent use than we yet have and if i be worthy to advise at the sit down to and rise from our table at our rise from and go to bed and in every particular action wherein prayer be use i would that christian always make use of the lord prayer if not alone yet at least always the church may lengthen and diversify prayer accord to the necessity of our instruction for i know very well that it be always the same in substance and the same thing but yet such a privilege ought to be give to that prayer that the people should have it continually in their mouth for it be most certain that all necessary petition be comprehend in it and that it be infinitely proper for all occasion tis the only prayer i use in all place and condition and which i still repeat instead of change whence it also happen that i have no other so entirely by heart a that it just now come into my mind whence it be we should derive that error of have recourse to god in all our design and enterprise to call him to our assistance in all sort of affair and in all place where our weakness stand in need of support without consider whether the occasion be just or otherwise and to invoke hi name and power in what state soever we be or action we be engage in howsoever vicious he be indeed our sole and unique protector and can do all thing for u but though he be pleased to honour u with this sweet paternal alliance he be notwithstanding as just a he be good and mighty and more often exercise hi justice than hi power and favour u accord to that and not accord to our petition plato in hi law make three sort of belief injurious to the god that there be none that they concern not themselves about our affair that they never refuse anything to our vow offering and sacrifice the first of these error accord to hi opinion never continue root in any man from hi infancy to hi old age the other two he confess men might be obstinate in god justice and hi power be inseparable ti in vain we invoke hi power in an unjust cause we be to have our souls pure and clean at that moment at least wherein we pray to him and purify from all vicious passion otherwise we ourselves present him the rod wherewith to chastise u instead of repair anything we have do amiss we double the wickedness and the offence when we offer to him to whom we be to sue for pardon an affection full of irreverence and hatred which make me not very apt to applaud those whom i observe to be so frequent on their knee if the action nearest to the prayer do not give me some evidence of amendment and reformation and the practice of a man who mix devotion with an execrable life seem in some sort more to be condemn than that of a man conformable to hi own propension and dissolute throughout and for that reason it be that our church deny admittance to and communion with men obstinate and incorrigible in any notorious wickedness we pray only by custom and for fashion sake or rather we read or pronounce our prayer aloud which be no good than an hypocritical show of devotion and i be scandalise to see a man cross himself thrice at the benedicite and as often at grace and the more because it be a sign i have in great veneration and continual use even when i yawn and to dedicate all the other hour of the day to act of malice avarice and injustice one hour to god the rest to the devil a if by composition and compensation ti a wonder to see action so various in themselves succeed one another with such an uniformity of method a not to interfere nor suffer any alteration even upon the very confines and pass from the one to the other what a prodigious conscience must that be that can be at quiet within itself whilst it harbour under the same roof with so agree and so calm a society both the crime and the judge a man whose whole meditation be continually work upon nothing but impurity which he know to be so odious to almighty god what can he say when he come to speak to him he draw back but immediately fall into a relapse if the object of divine justice and the presence of hi maker do a he pretend strike and chastise hi soul how short soever the repentance might be the very fear of offend the infinite majesty would so often present itself to hi imagination that he would soon see himself master of those vice that be most natural and vehement in him but what shall we say of those who settle their whole course of life upon the profit and emolument of sin which they know to be mortal how many trade and vocation have we admit and countenance amongst u whose very essence be vicious and he that confess himself to me voluntarily tell me that he have all hi lifetime profess and practise a religion in hi opinion damnable and contrary to that he have in hi heart only to preserve hi credit and the honour of hi employment how could hi courage suffer so infamous a confession what can men say to the divine justice upon this subject their repentance consist in a visible and manifest reparation they lose the colour of allege it both to god and man be they so impudent a to sue for remission without satisfaction and without penitence i look upon these a in the same condition with the first but the obstinacy be not there so easy to be overcome this contrariety and volubility of opinion so sudden so violent that they feign be a kind of miracle to me they present u with the state of an indigestible agony of mind it seem to me a fantastic imagination in those who these late year past be wont to reproach every man they know to be of any extraordinary part and make profession of the catholic religion that it be but outwardly maintain moreover to do him honour forsooth that whatever he might pretend to the contrary he could not but in hi heart be of their reform opinion an untoward disease that a man should be so riveted to hi own belief a to fancy that other can not believe otherwise than a he do and yet bad that they should entertain so vicious an opinion of such great part a to think any man so qualified should prefer any present advantage of fortune to the promise of eternal life and the menace of eternal damnation they may believe me could anything have tempt my youth the ambition of the danger and difficulty in the late commotion have not be the least motif it be not without very good reason in my opinion that the church interdict the promiscuous indiscreet and irreverent use of the holy and divine psalm with which the holy ghost inspire king david we ought not to mix god in our action but with the high reverence and caution that poesy be too holy to be put to no other use than to exercise the lung and to delight our ear it ought to come from the conscience and not from the tongue it be not fit that a prentice in hi shop amongst hi vain and frivolous thought should be permit to pass away hi time and divert himself with such sacred thing neither be it decent to see the holy book of the holy mystery of our belief tumble up and down a hall or a kitchen they be formerly mystery but be now become sport and recreation tis a book too serious and too venerable to be cursorily or slightly turn over the reading of the scripture ought to be a temperate and premeditate act and to which men should always add this devout preface sursum corda prepare even the body to so humble and compose a gesture and countenance a shall evidence a particular veneration and attention neither be it a book for everyone to fist but the study of select men set apart for that purpose and whom almighty god have be please to call to that office and sacred function the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it ti not a story to tell but a history to revere fear and adore be not they then pleasant men who think they have render this fit for the people handle by translate it into the vulgar tongue do the understanding of all therein contain only stick at word shall i venture to say further that by come so near to understand a little they be much wider of the whole scope than before a pure and simple ignorance and wholly depend upon the exposition of qualified person be far more learned and salutary than this vain and verbal knowledge which have only temerity and presumption and i do far believe that the liberty every one have take to disperse the sacred writ into so many idiom carry with it a great deal more of danger than utility the jew mohammedan and almost all other people have reverentially espouse the language wherein their mystery be first conceive and have expressly and not without colour of reason forbid the alteration of them into any other are we assure that in biscay and in brittany there be enough competent judge of this affair to establish this translation into their own language the universal church have not a more difficult and solemn judgment to make in preaching and speak the interpretation be vague free mutable and of a piece by itself so tis not the same thing one of our greek historian age justly censure the he live in because the secret of the christian religion be disperse into the hand of every mechanic to expound and argue upon accord to hi own fancy and that we ought to be much ashamed we who by god especial favour enjoy the pure mystery of piety to suffer them to be profane by the ignorant rabble consider that the gentile expressly forbid socrates plato and the other sage to inquire into or so much a mention the thing commit to the priest of delphi and he say moreover that the faction of prince upon theological subject be arm not with zeal but fury that zeal spring from the divine wisdom and justice and govern itself with prudence and moderation but degenerate into hatred and envy produce tare and nettle instead of corn and wine when conduct by human passion and it be truly say by another who advise the emperor theodosius tell him that dispute do not so much rock the schism of the church asleep a it rouse and animate heresy that therefore all contention and dialectic disputation be to be avoid and men absolutely to acquiesce in the prescription and formula of faith establish by the ancient and the emperor andronicus have overheard some great men at high word in hi palace with lapodius about a point of ours of great importance give them so severe a check a to threaten to cause them to be throw into the river if they do not desist the very woman and child nowadays take upon them to lecture the old and most experienced men about the ecclesiastical law whereas the first of those of plato forbids them to inquire so much a into the civil law which be to stand instead of divine ordinance and allow the old men to confer amongst themselves or with the magistrate about those thing he add provide it be not in the presence of young or profane person a bishop have leave in write that at the other end of the world there be an isle by the ancient call dioscorides abundantly fertile in all sort of tree and fruit and of an exceedingly healthful air the inhabitant of which be christian have church and altars only adorn with cross without any other image great observer of fast and feast exact payer of their tithe to the priest and so chaste that none of them be permit to have to do with more than one woman in hi life a to the rest so content with their condition that environ with the sea they know nothing of navigation and so simple that they understand not one syllable of the religion they profess and wherein they be so devout a thing incredible to such a do not know that the pagan who be so zealous idolater know nothing more of their god than their bare name and their statue the ancient beginning of menalippus a tragedy of euripides run thus i have also know in my time some men writing find fault with for be purely human and philosophical without any mixture of theology and yet with some show of reason it might on the contrary be say that the divine doctrine a queen and regent of the rest well keep her state apart that she ought to be sovereign throughout not subsidiary and suffragan and that peradventure grammatical rhetorical logical example may elsewhere be more suitably choose a also the material for the stage game and public entertainment than from so sacred a matter that divine reason be consider with great veneration and attention by themselves and in their own proper style than when mixed with and adapt to human discourse that it be a fault much more often observe that the divine write too humanly than that the humanist write not theologically enough philosophy say st chrysostom have long be banish the holy school a an handmaid altogether useless and think unworthy to look so much a in passing by the door into the sanctuary of the holy treasure of the celestial doctrine that the human way of speaking be of a much low form and ought not to adopt for herself the dignity and majesty of divine eloquence let who will verbis indisciplinatis talk of fortune destiny accident good and evil hap and other suchlike phrase accord to hi own humour i for my part propose fancy merely human and merely my own and that simply a human fancy and separately consider not a determine by any decree from heaven incapable of doubt or dispute matter of opinion not matter of faith thing which i discourse of accord to my own notion not a i believe accord to god after a laical not clerical and yet always after a very religious manner a child prepare their exercise not to instruct but to be instruct and might it not be say that an edict enjoin all people but such a be public professor of divinity to be very reserve in writing of religion would carry with it a very good colour of utility and justice and to me amongst the rest peradventure to hold my prate i have be tell that even those who be not of our church nevertheless amongst themselves expressly forbid the name of god to be use in common discourse nor so much even by way of interjection exclamation assertion of a truth or comparison and i think them in the right upon what occasion soever we call upon god to accompany and assist u it ought always to be do with the great reverence and devotion there be a i remember a passage in xenophon where he tell u that we ought so much the more seldom to call upon god by how much it be hard to compose our soul to such a degree of calmness patience and devotion a it ought to be in at such a time otherwise our prayer be not only vain and fruitless but vicious forgive u we say our trespass a we forgive them that trespass against u what do we mean by this petition but that we present to god a soul free from all rancour and revenge and yet we make nothing of invoke god assistance in our vice and invite him into our unjust design the covetous man prays for the conservation of hi vain and superfluous rich the ambitious for victory and the good conduct of hi fortune the thief call him to hi assistance to deliver him from the danger and difficulty that obstruct hi wicked design or return him thanks for the facility he have meet with in cut a mans throat at the door of the house men be go to storm or break into by force of a petard they fall to prayer for success their intention and hope of cruelty avarice and lust marguerite queen of navarre tell of a young prince who though she do not name him be easily enough by hi great quality to be know who go upon an amorous assignation to lie with an advocates wife of paris hi way thither be through a church he never pass that holy place go to or return from hi pious exercise but he always kneel down to pray wherein he would employ the divine favour hi soul be full of such virtuous meditation i leave other to judge which nevertheless she instance for a testimony of singular devotion but this be not the only proof we have that woman be not very fit to treat of theological affair a true prayer and religious reconciling of ourselves to almighty god can not enter into an impure soul subject at the very time to the dominion of satan he who call god to hi assistance whilst in a course of vice do a if a cutpurse should call a magistrate to help him or like those who introduce the name of god to the attestation of a lie there be few men who durst publish to the world the prayer they make to almighty god and this be the reason why the pythagorean would have them always public and hear by every one to the end they might not prefer indecent or unjust petition a this man the god severely punish the wicked prayer of oedipus in grant them he have pray that hi child might amongst themselves determine the succession to hi throne by arm and be so miserable a to see himself take at hi word we be not to pray that all thing may go a we would have them but a most concurrent with prudence we seem in truth to make use of our prayer a of a kind of jargon and a those do who employ holy word about sorcery and magical operation and a if we reckon the benefit we be to reap from them a depend upon the contexture sound and jingle of word or upon the grave composing of the countenance for have the soul contaminate with concupiscence not touch with repentance or comfort by any late reconciliation with god we go to present him such word a the memory suggest to the tongue and hope from thence to obtain the remission of our sin there be nothing so easy so sweet and so favourable a the divine law it call and invite u to her guilty and abominable a we be extend her arm and receive u into her bosom foul and pollute a we at present be and be for the future to be but then in return we be to look upon her with a respectful eye we be to receive this pardon with all gratitude and submission and for that instant at least wherein we address ourselves to her to have the soul sensible of the ill we have commit and at enmity with those passion that seduce u to offend her neither the god nor good men say plato will accept the present of a wicked man i can not allow of the way in which we settle for ourselves the duration of our life i see that the sage contract it very much in comparison of the common opinion what say the young cato to those who would stay hi hand from kill himself be i now of an age to be reproach that i go out of the world too soon and yet he be but eightandforty year old he think that to be a mature and advanced age consider how few arrive unto it and such a soothe their thought with i know not what course of nature promise to themselves some year beyond it could they be privilege from the infinite number of accident to which we be by a natural subjection expose they might have some reason so to do what be idle conceit be it to expect to die of a decay of strength which be the effect of extreme age and to propose to ourselves no short lease of life than that consider it be a kind of death of all other the most rare and very seldom see we call that only a natural death a if it be contrary to nature to see a man break hi neck with a fall be drown in shipwreck be snatch away with a pleurisy or the plague and a if our ordinary condition do not expose u to these inconvenience let u no longer flat ourselves with these fine word we ought rather peradventure to call that natural which be general common and universal to die of old age be a death rare extraordinary and singular and therefore so much less natural than the other tis the last and extreme sort of dying and the more remote the less to be hop for it be indeed the bourn beyond which we be not to pas and which the law of nature have set a a limit not to be exceed but it be withal a privilege she be rarely see to give u to last till then ti a lease she only sign by particular favour and it may be to one only in the space of two or three age and then with a pas to boot to carry him through all the traverse and difficulty she have strew in the way of this long career and therefore my opinion be that when once forty year we should consider it a an age to which very few arrive for see that men do not usually proceed so far it be a sign that we be pretty well advanced and since we have exceed the ordinary bound which be the just measure of life we ought not to expect to go much far have escape so many precipice of death whereinto we have see so many other men fall we should acknowledge that so extraordinary a fortune a that which have hitherto rescue u from those eminent peril and keep u alive beyond the ordinary term of living be not like to continue long ti a fault in our very law to maintain this error these say that a man be not capable of manage hi own estate till he be fiveandtwenty year old whereas he will have much ado to manage hi life so long augustus cut off five year from the ancient roman standard and declare that thirty year old be sufficient for a judge servius tullius supersede the knight of above sevenandforty year of age from the fatigue of war augustus dismiss them at fortyfive though methinks it seem a little unreasonable that men should be send to the fireside till fiveandfifty or sixty year of age i should be of opinion that our vocation and employment should be as far a possible extend for the public good i find the fault on the other side that they do not employ u early enough this emperor be arbiter of the whole world at nineteen and yet would have a man to be thirty before he could be fit to determine a dispute about a gutter for my part i believe our soul be adult at twenty as much a they be ever like to be and a capable then a ever a soul that have not by that time give evident earnest of it force and virtue will never after come to proof the natural quality and virtue produce what they have of vigorous and fine within that term or never a they say in dauphin of all the great human action i ever hear or read of of what sort soever i have observe both in former age and our own more be perform before the age of thirty than after and this ofttimes in the very life of the same men may i not confidently instance in those of hannibal and hi great rival scipio the good half of their life they live upon the glory they have acquire in their youth great men after ti true in comparison of other but by no mean in comparison of themselves a to my own particular i do certainly believe that since that age both my understanding and my constitution have rather decay than improve and retire rather than advanced ti possible that with those who make the best use of their time knowledge and experience may increase with their year but vivacity promptitude steadiness and other piece of u of much great importance and much more essentially our own languish and decay sometimes the body first submit to age sometimes the mind and i have see enough who have get a weakness in their brain before either in their leg or stomach and by how much the more it be a disease of no great pain to the sufferer and of obscure symptom so much great be the danger for this reason it be that i complain of our law not that they keep u too long to our work but that they set u to work too late for the frailty of life consider and to how many ordinary and natural rock it be expose one ought not to give up so large a portion of it to childhood idleness and apprenticeship
