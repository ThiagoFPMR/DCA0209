ambrosio shudder at himself when he reflect on hi rapid advance in iniquity the enormous crime which he have just commit fill him with real horror the murder elvira be continually before hi eye and hi guilt be already punish by the agony of hi conscience time however considerably weaken these impression one day pass away another follow it and still not the least suspicion be throw upon him impunity reconcile him to hi guilt he begin to resume hi spirit and a hi fear of detection die away he pay less attention to the reproach of remorse matilda exert herself to quiet hi alarm at the first intelligence of elviras death she seem greatly affected and join the monk in deplore the unhappy catastrophe of hi adventure but when she find hi agitation to be somewhat calmed and himself good dispose to listen to her argument she proceed to mention hi offence in milder term and convince him that he be not so highly culpable a he appear to consider himself she represent that he have only avail himself of the right which nature allow to every one those of selfpreservation that either elvira or himself must have perish and that her inflexibility and resolution to ruin him have deservedly mark her out for the victim she next state that a he have before render himself suspect to elvira it be a fortunate event for him that her lip be close by death since without this last adventure her suspicion if make public might have produce very disagreeable consequence he have therefore free himself from an enemy to whom the error of hi conduct be sufficiently know to make her dangerous and who be the great obstacle to hi design upon antonia those design she encourage him not to abandon she assure him that no longer protect by her mother watchful eye the daughter would fall an easy conquest and by praise and enumerate antonias charm she strive to rekindle the desire of the monk in this endeavour she succeed but too well a if the crime into which hi passion have seduce him have only increase it violence he long more eagerly than ever to enjoy antonia the same success in conceal hi present guilt he trust would attend hi future he be deaf to the murmur of conscience and resolve to satisfy hi desire at any price he wait only for an opportunity of repeat hi former enterprize but to procure that opportunity by the same mean be now impracticable in the first transport of despair he have dash the enchanted myrtle into a thousand piece matilda tell him plainly that he must expect no further assistance from the infernal power unless he be willing to subscribe to their establish condition this ambrosio be determine not to do he persuade himself that however great might be hi iniquity so long a he preserve hi claim to salvation he need not despair of pardon he therefore resolutely refuse to enter into any bond or compact with the fiend and matilda find him obstinate upon this point forbore to press him further she exert her invention to discover some mean of put antonia into the abbot power nor be it long before that mean present itself while her ruin be thus meditate the unhappy girl herself suffer severely from the loss of her mother every morning on wake it be her first care to hasten to elviras chamber on that which follow ambrosios fatal visit she wake later than be her usual custom of this she be convince by the abbey chime she start from her bed threw on a few loose garment hastily and be speed to enquire how her mother have pass the night when her foot struck against something which lay in her passage she look down what be her horror at recognize elviras livid corse she utter a loud shriek and throw herself upon the floor she clasp the inanimate form to her bosom felt that it be deadcold and with a movement of disgust of which she be not the mistress let it fall again from her arm the cry have alarm flora who hasten to her assistance the sight which she behold penetrate her with horror but her alarm be more audible than antonias she make the house ring with her lamentation while her mistress almost suffocate with grief could only mark her distress by sob and groan flora shrieks soon reach the ear of the hostess whose terror and surprize be excessive on learn the cause of this disturbance a physician be immediately send for but on the first moment of behold the corse he declare that elviras recovery be beyond the power of art he proceed therefore to give hi assistance to antonia who by this time be truly in need of it she be convey to bed while the landlady busy herself in give order for elviras burial dame jacintha be a plain good kind of woman charitable generous and devout but her intellect be weak and she be a miserable slave to fear and superstition she shudder at the idea of pass the night in the same house with a dead body she be persuade that elviras ghost would appear to her and no less certain that such a visit would kill her with fright from this persuasion she resolve to pass the night at a neighbour and insist that the funeral should take place the next day st clares cemetery be the near it be determine that elvira should be bury there dame jacintha engage to defray every expence attend the burial she know not in what circumstance antonia be leave but from the spar manner in which the family have live she conclude them to be indifferent consequently she entertain very little hope of ever be recompense but this consideration prevent her not from take care that the interment be perform with decency and from show the unfortunate antonia all possible respect nobody die of mere grief of this antonia be an instance aid by her youth and healthy constitution she shake off the malady which her mother death have occasion but it be not so easy to remove the disease of her mind her eye be constantly fill with tear every trifle affect her and she evidently nourish in her bosom a profound and root melancholy the slight mention of elvira the most trivial circumstance recall that beloved parent to her memory be sufficient to throw her into serious agitation how much would her grief have be increase have she know the agony which terminate her mother existence but of this no one entertain the least suspicion elvira be subject to strong convulsion it be suppose that aware of their approach she have drag herself to her daughter chamber in hope of assistance that a sudden access of her fit have seize her too violent to be resist by her already enfeebled state of health and that she have expire ere she have time to reach the medicine which generally relieve her and which stand upon a shelf in antonias room this idea be firmly credit by the few people who interest themselves about elvira her death be esteem a natural event and soon forget by all save by her who have but too much reason to deplore her loss in truth antonias situation be sufficiently embarrass and unpleasant she be alone in the midst of a dissipated and expensive city she be ill provide with money and worse with friend her aunt leonella be still at cordova and she know not her direction of the marquis de la cisterna she hear no news a to lorenzo she have long give up the idea of possess any interest in hi bosom she know not to whom she could address herself in her present dilemma she wish to consult ambrosio but she remember her mother injunction to shun him as much a possible and the last conversation which elvira have hold with her upon the subject have give her sufficient light respect hi design to put her upon her guard against him in future still all her mother warning could not make her change her good opinion of the friar she continue to feel that hi friendship and society be requisite to her happiness she look upon hi failing with a partial eye and could not persuade herself that he really have intend her ruin however elvira have positively command her to drop hi acquaintance and she have too much respect for her order to disobey them at length she resolve to address herself for advice and protection to the marquis de la cisterna a be her near relation she write to him briefly state her desolate situation she beseech him to compassionate hi brother child to continue to her elviras pension and to authorise her retire to hi old castle in murcia which till now have be her retreat have seal her letter she give it to the trusty flora who immediately set out to execute her commission but antonia be bear under an unlucky star had she make her application to the marquis but one day sooner receive a hi niece and place at the head of hi family she would have escape all the misfortune with which she be now threaten raymond have always intend to execute this plan but first hi hope of make the proposal to elvira through the lip of agnes and afterwards hi disappointment at lose hi intended bride as well a the severe illness which for some time have confine him to hi bed make him defer from day to day the give an asylum in hi house to hi brother widow he have commission lorenzo to supply her liberally with money but elvira unwilling to receive obligation from that nobleman have assure him that she need no immediate pecuniary assistance consequently the marquis do not imagine that a trifling delay on hi part could create any embarrassment and the distress and agitation of hi mind might well excuse hi negligence have he be inform that elviras death have leave her daughter friendless and unprotected he would doubtless have take such measure a would have ensure her from every danger but antonia be not destine to be so fortunate the day on which she send her letter to the palace de la cisterna be that follow lorenzos departure from madrid the marquis be in the first paroxysm of despair at the conviction that agnes be indeed no more he be delirious and hi life be in danger no one be suffer to approach him flora be inform that he be incapable of attend to letter and that probably a few hour would decide hi fate with this unsatisfactory answer she be oblige to return to her mistress who now find herself plunge into great difficulty than ever flora and dame jacintha exert themselves to console her the latter beg her to make herself easy for that as long a she choose to stay with her she would treat her like her own child antonia find that the good woman have take a real affection for her be somewhat comfort by think that she have at least one friend in the world a letter be now bring to her direct to elvira she recognize leonellas writing and open it with joy find a detailed account of her aunt adventure at cordova she inform her sister that she have recover her legacy have lose her heart and have receive in exchange that of the most amiable of apothecary past present and to come she add that she should be at madrid on the tuesday night and meant to have the pleasure of present her caro sposo in form though her nuptials be far from please antonia leonellas speedy return give her niece much delight she rejoice in thinking that she should once more be under a relation care she could not but judge it to be highly improper for a young woman to be live among absolute stranger with no one to regulate her conduct or protect her from the insult to which in her defenceless situation she be expose she therefore look forward with impatience to the tuesday night it arrive antonia listen anxiously to the carriage a they roll along the street none of them stop and it grow late without leonellas appear still antonia resolve to sit up till her aunt arrival and in spite of all her remonstrance dame jacintha and flora insist upon do the same the hour pass on slow and tediously lorenzos departure from madrid have put a stop to the nightly serenade she hop in vain to hear the usual sound of guitar beneath her window she take up her own and strike a few chord but music that even have lose it charm for her and she soon replace the instrument in it case she seat herself at her embroidery frame but nothing go right the silk be miss the thread snap every moment and the needle be so expert at fall that they seem to be animate at length a flake of wax fell from the taper which stand near her upon a favourite wreath of violet this compleatly discompose her she throw down her needle and quit the frame it be decree that for that night nothing should have the power of amuse her she be the prey of ennui and employ herself in make fruitless wish for the arrival of her aunt a she walk with a listless air up and down the chamber the door catch her eye conducting to that which have be her mother she remember that elviras little library be arrange there and think that she might possibly find in it some book to amuse her till leonella should arrive accordingly she take her taper from the table pass through the little closet and enter the adjoin apartment a she look around her the sight of this room bring to her recollection a thousand painful idea it be the first time of her enter it since her mother death the total silence prevailing through the chamber the bed despoil of it furniture the cheerless hearth where stand an extinguished lamp and a few dying plant in the window which since elviras loss have be neglect inspired antonia with a melancholy awe the gloom of night give strength to this sensation she place her light upon the table and sink into a large chair in which she have see her mother seat a thousand and a thousand time she be never to see her seat there again tear unbidden stream down her cheek and she abandon herself to the sadness which grow deep with every moment ashamed of her weakness she at length rise from her seat she proceed to seek for what have bring her to this melancholy scene the small collection of book be arrange upon several shelf in order antonia examine them without find any thing likely to interest her till she put her hand upon a volume of old spanish ballad she read a few stanza of one of them they excite her curiosity she take down the book and seat herself to peruse it with more ease she trim the taper which now draw towards it end and then read the following ballad the perusal of this story be illcalculated to dispel antonias melancholy she have naturally a strong inclination to the marvellous and her nurse who believe firmly in apparition have relate to her when an infant so many horrible adventure of this kind that all elviras attempt have fail to eradicate their impression from her daughter mind antonia still nourish a superstitious prejudice in her bosom she be often susceptible of terror which when she discover their natural and insignificant cause make her blush at her own weakness with such a turn of mind the adventure which she have just be read suffice to give her apprehension the alarm the hour and the scene combine to authorize them it be the dead of night she be alone and in the chamber once occupy by her deceased mother the weather be comfortless and stormy the wind howl around the house the door rattle in their frame and the heavy rain patter against the window no other sound be hear the taper now burn down to the socket sometimes flaring upwards shoot a gleam of light through the room then sink again seem upon the point of expire antonias heart throbbed with agitation her eye wander fearfully over the object around her a the trembling flame illuminate them at interval she attempt to rise from her seat but her limb tremble so violently that she be unable to proceed she then call flora who be in a room at no great distance but agitation choaked her voice and her cry die away in hollow murmur she pass some minute in this situation after which her terror begin to diminish she strive to recover herself and acquire strength enough to quit the room suddenly she fancy that she hear a low sigh drawn near her this idea bring back her former weakness she have already raise herself from her seat and be on the point of take the lamp from the table the imaginary noise stop her she draw back her hand and support herself upon the back of a chair she listen anxiously but nothing more be heard gracious god she say to herself what could be that sound wa i deceive or do i really hear it her reflection be interrupt by a noise at the door scarcely audible it seem a if somebody be whisper antonias alarm increase yet the bolt she know to be fasten and this idea in some degree reassure her presently the latch be lift up softly and the door move with caution backwards and forward excess of terror now supply antonia with that strength of which she have till then be deprive she start from her place and make towards the closet door whence she might soon have reach the chamber where she expect to find flora and dame jacintha scarcely have she reach the middle of the room when the latch be lift up a second time an involuntary movement oblige her to turn her head slowly and gradually the door turn upon it hinge and stand upon the threshold she behold a tall thin figure wrap in a white shroud which cover it from head to foot this vision arrest her foot she remain a if petrify in the middle of the apartment the stranger with measure and solemn step draw near the table the die taper dart a blue and melancholy flame a the figure advance towards it over the table be fix a small clock the hand of it be upon the stroke of three the figure stop opposite to the clock it raise it right arm and point to the hour at the same time look earnestly upon antonia who wait for the conclusion of this scene motionless and silent the figure remain in this posture for some moment the clock strike when the sound have cease the stranger advance yet a few step nearer antonia yet three day say a voice faint hollow and sepulchral yet three day and we meet again antonia shudder at the word we meet again she pronounce at length with difficulty where shall we meet whom shall i meet the figure point to the ground with one hand and with the other raise the linen which cover it face almighty god my mother antonia shriek and fell lifeless upon the floor dame jacintha who be at work in a neighbouring chamber be alarm by the cry flora be just go down stair to fetch fresh oil for the lamp by which they have be sit jacintha therefore hasten alone to antonias assistance and great be her amazement to find her extend upon the floor she raise her in her arm convey her to her apartment and place her upon the bed still senseless she then proceed to bathe her temple chafe her hand and use all possible mean of bring her to herself with some difficulty she succeed antonia open her eye and look round her wildly where be she she cry in a trembling voice be she go be i safe speak to me comfort me oh speak to me for god sake safe from whom my child reply the astonished jacintha what alarm you of whom be you afraid in three day she tell me that we should meet in three day i hear her say it i saw her jacintha i saw her but this moment she throw herself upon jacinthas bosom you saw her saw whom my mother ghost christ jesus cry jacintha and start from the bed let fall antonia upon the pillow and flee in consternation out of the room a she hasten down stair she meet flora ascend them go to your mistress flora say she here be rare doings oh i be the most unfortunate woman alive my house be fill with ghost and dead body and the lord know what besides yet i be sure nobody like such company less than i do but go your way to donna antonia flora and let me go mine thus say she continue her course to the street door which she open and without allow herself time to throw on her veil she make the best of her way to the capuchin abbey in the meanwhile flora hasten to her lady chamber equally surprized and alarm at jacinthas consternation she find antonia lie upon the bed insensible she use the same mean for her recovery that jacintha have already employ but find that her mistress only recover from one fit to fall into another she send in all haste for a physician while expect hi arrival she undrest antonia and convey her to bed heedless of the storm terrify almost out of her sens jacintha run through the street and stop not till she reach the gate of the abbey she ring loudly at the bell and as soon a the porter appear she desire permission to speak to the superior ambrosio be then confer with matilda upon the mean of procure access to antonia the cause of elviras death remain unknown he be convince that crime be not so swiftly follow by punishment a hi instructor the monk have teach him and a till then he have himself believe this persuasion make him resolve upon antonias ruin for the enjoyment of whose person danger and difficulty only seem to have increase hi passion the monk have already make one attempt to gain admission to her presence but flora have refuse him in such a manner a to convince him that all future endeavour must be vain elvira have confide her suspicion to that trusty servant she have desire her never to leave ambrosio alone with her daughter and if possible to prevent their meeting altogether flora promise to obey her and have execute her order to the very letter ambrosios visit have be reject that morning though antonia be ignorant of it he saw that to obtain a sight of hi mistress by open mean be out of the question and both himself and matilda have consume the night in endeavour to invent some plan whose event might be more successful such be their employment when a laybrother enter the abbot cell and inform him that a woman call herself jacintha zuniga request audience for a few minute ambrosio be by no mean dispose to grant the petition of hi visitor he refuse it positively and bad the laybrother tell the stranger to return the next day matilda interrupt him see this woman say she in a low voice i have my reason the abbot obey her and signify that he would go to the parlour immediately with this answer the laybrother withdraw as soon a they be alone ambrosio enquire why matilda wish him to see this jacintha she be antonias hostess reply matilda she may possibly be of use to you but let u examine her and learn what bring her hither they proceed together to the parlour where jacintha be already wait for the abbot she have conceive a great opinion of hi piety and virtue and suppose him to have much influence over the devil think that it must be an easy matter for him to lay elviras ghost in the red sea fill with this persuasion she have hasten to the abbey a soon a she saw the monk enter the parlour she drop upon her knee and begin her story a follow oh reverend father such an accident such an adventure i know not what course to take and unless you can help me i shall certainly go distracted well to be sure never be woman so unfortunate a myself all in my power to keep clear of such abomination have i do and yet that all be too little what signify my tell my bead four time a day and observe every fast prescribe by the calendar what signify my have make three pilgrimage to st james of compostella and purchase a many pardon from the pope a would buy off cain punishment nothing prospers with me all go wrong and god only know whether any thing will ever go right again why now be your holiness the judge my lodger die in convulsion out of pure kindness i bury her at my own expence not that she be any relation of mine or that i shall be benefit a single pistol by her death i get nothing by it and therefore you know reverend father that her living or dying be just the same to me but that be nothing to the purpose to return to what i be say i take care of her funeral have every thing perform decently and properly and put myself to expence enough god know and how do you think the lady repay me for my kindness why truly by refuse to sleep quietly in her comfortable deal coffin a a peaceable welldisposed spirit ought to do and come to plague me who never wish to set eye on her again forsooth it well become her to go racket about my house at midnight pop into her daughter room through the keyhole and frighten the poor child out of her wit though she be a ghost she might be more civil than to bolt into a person house who like her company so little but a for me reverend father the plain state of the case be this if she walk into my house i must walk out of it for i can not abide such visitor not i thus you see your sanctity that without your assistance i be ruin and undone for ever i shall be oblige to quit my house nobody will take it when ti know that she haunt it and then i shall find myself in a fine situation miserable woman that i be what shall i do what will become of me here she weep bitterly wrung her hand and beg to know the abbot opinion of her case in truth good woman reply he it will be difficult for me to relieve you without know what be the matter with you you have forget to tell me what have happen and what it be you want let me die cried jacintha but your sanctity be in the right this then be the fact state briefly a lodger of mine be lately dead a very good sort of woman that i must need say for her as far a my knowledge of her go though that be not a great way she keep me too much at a distance for indeed she be give to be upon the high rope and whenever i venture to speak to her she have a look with her which always make me feel a little queerish god forgive me for say so however though she be more stately than needful and affect to look down upon me though if i be well inform i come of as good parent a she could do for her ear for her father be a shoemaker at cordova and mine be an hatter at madrid aye and a very creditable hatter too let me tell you yet for all her pride she be a quiet wellbehaved body and i never wish to have a good lodger this make me wonder the more at her not sleep quietly in her grave but there be no trust to people in this world for my part i never saw her do amiss except on the friday before her death to be sure i be then much scandalize by see her eat the wing of a chicken how madona flora quoth i flora may it please your reverence be the name of the wait maidhow madona flora quoth i do your mistress eat flesh upon friday well well see the event and then remember that dame jacintha warn you of it these be my very word but ala i might as well have hold my tongue nobody mind me and flora who be somewhat pert and snappish more be the pity say i tell me that there be no more harm in eat a chicken than the egg from which it come nay she even declare that if her lady add a slice of bacon she would not be an inch nearer damnation god protect u a poor ignorant sinful soul i protest to your holiness i tremble to hear her utter such blasphemy and expect every moment to see the ground open and swallow her up chicken and all for you must know worshipful father that while she talk thus she hold the plate in her hand on which lay the identical roast fowl and a fine bird it be that i must say for it done to a turn for i superintend the cooking of it myself it be a little gallician of my own raising may it please your holiness and the flesh be as white a an eggshell a indeed donna elvira tell me herself dame jacintha say she very goodhumouredly though to say the truth she be always very polite to me here ambrosios patience fail him eager to know jacinthas business in which antonia seem to be concern he be almost distract while listen to the rambling of this prose old woman he interrupt her and protest that if she do not immediately tell her story and have do with it he should quit the parlour and leave her to get out of her difficulty by herself this threat have the desired effect jacintha relate her business in a few word a she could manage but her account be still so prolix that ambrosio have need of hi patience to bear him to the conclusion and so your reverence say she after relate elviras death and burial with all their circumstance and so your reverence upon hear the shriek i put away my work and away post i to donna antonias chamber find nobody there i past on to the next but i must own i be a little timorous at go in for this be the very room where donna elvira use to sleep however in i go and sure enough there lay the young lady at full length upon the floor as cold a a stone and as white a a sheet i be surprized at this a your holiness may well suppose but oh me how i shake when i saw a great tall figure at my elbow whose head touch the ceiling the face be donna elviras i must confess but out of it mouth come cloud of fire it arm be load with heavy chain which it rattle piteously and every hair on it head be a serpent as big a my arm at this i be frighten enough and begin to say my avemaria but the ghost interrupting me utter three loud groan and roar out in a terrible voice oh that chicken wing my poor soul suffers for it a soon a she have say this the ground open the spectre sink down i hear a clap of thunder and the room be fill with a smell of brimstone when i recover from my fright and have bring donna antonia to herself who tell me that she have cry out upon see her mother ghost and well might she cry poor soul had i be in her place i should have cry ten time louder it directly come into my head that if any one have power to quiet this spectre it must be your reverence so hither i come in all diligenceto beg that you will sprinkle my house with holy water and lay the apparition in the red sea ambrosio star at this strange story which he could not credit did donna antonia also see the ghost say he a plain a i see you reverend father ambrosio pause for a moment here be an opportunity offer him of gain access to antonia but he hesitate to employ it the reputation which he enjoy in madrid be still dear to him and since he have lose the reality of virtue it appear a if it semblance be become more valuable he be conscious that publicly to break through the rule never to quit the abbey precinct would derogate much from hi suppose austerity in visit elvira he have always take care to keep hi feature conceal from the domestic except by the lady her daughter and the faithful flora he be know in the family by no other name than that of father jerome should he comply with jacinthas request and accompany her to her house he know that the violation of hi rule could not be keep a secret however hi eagerness to see antonia obtain the victory he even hop that the singularity of this adventure would justify him in the eye of madrid but whatever might be the consequence he resolve to profit by the opportunity which chance have present to him an expressive look from matilda confirm him in this resolution good woman say he to jacintha what you tell me be so extraordinary that i can scarcely credit your assertion however i will comply with your request tomorrow after matins you may expect me at your house i will then examine into what i can do for you and if it be in my power will free you from this unwelcome visitor now then go home and peace be with you home exclaim jacintha i go home not i by my troth except under your protection i set no foot of mine within the threshold god help me the ghost may meet me upon the stair and whisk me away with her to the devil oh that i have accept young melchior bascos offer then i should have have somebody to protect me but now i be a lone woman and meet with nothing but cross and misfortune thank heaven it be not yet too late to repent there be simon gonzalez will have me any day of the week and if i live till daybreak i will marry him out of hand an husband i will have that be determine for now this ghost be once in my house i shall be frighten out of my wit to sleep alone but for god sake reverend father come with me now i shall have no rest till the house be purify or the poor young lady either the dear girl she be in a piteous take i leave her in strong convulsion and i doubt she will not easily recover her fright the friar start and interrupt her hastily in convulsion say you antonia in convulsion lead on good woman i follow you this moment jacintha insist upon hi stop to furnish himself with the vessel of holy water with this request he comply think herself safe under hi protection should a legion of ghost attack her the old woman return the monk a profusion of thanks and they depart together for the strada di san iago so strong an impression have the spectre make upon antonia that for the first two or three hour the physician declare her life to be in danger the fit at length become less frequent induce him to alter hi opinion he say that to keep her quiet be all that be necessary and he order a medicine to be prepare which would tranquillize her nerve and procure her that repose which at present she much want the sight of ambrosio who now appear with jacintha at her bedside contribute essentially to compose her ruffled spirit elvira have not sufficiently explain herself upon the nature of hi design to make a girl so ignorant of the world a her daughter aware how dangerous be hi acquaintance at this moment when penetrate with horror at the scene which have just past and dread to contemplate the ghost prediction her mind have need of all the succour of friendship and religion antonia regard the abbot with an eye doubly partial that strong prepossession in hi favour still exist which she have felt for him at first sight she fancy yet know not wherefore that hi presence be a safeguard to her from every danger insult or misfortune she thank him gratefully for hi visit and relate to him the adventure which have alarm her so seriously the abbot strove to reassure her and convince her that the whole have be a deception of her overheated fancy the solitude in which she have pass the evening the gloom of night the book which she have be read and the room in which she sit be all calculate to place before her such a vision he treat the idea of ghost with ridicule and produce strong argument to prove the fallacy of such a system hi conversation tranquillize and comfort her but do not convince her she could not believe that the spectre have be a mere creature of her imagination every circumstance be impressed upon her mind too forcibly to permit her flatter herself with such an idea she persist in assert that she have really see her mother ghost have hear the period of her dissolution announce and declare that she never should quit her bed alive ambrosio advise her against encourage these sentiment and then quit her chamber have promise to repeat hi visit on the morrow antonia receive this assurance with every mark of joy but the monk easily perceive that he be not equally acceptable to her attendant flora obey elviras injunction with the most scrupulous observance she examine every circumstance with an anxious eye likely in the least to prejudice her young mistress to whom she have be attach for many year she be a native of cuba have follow elvira to spain and love the young antonia with a mother affection flora quit not the room for a moment while the abbot remain there she watch hi every word hi every look hi every action he saw that her suspicious eye be always fix upon him and conscious that hi design would not bear inspection so minute he felt frequently confuse and disconcert he be aware that she doubt the purity of hi intention that she would never leave him alone with antonia and hi mistress defend by the presence of this vigilant observer he despair of find the mean to gratify hi passion a he quit the house jacintha meet him and beg that some mass might be sing for the repose of elviras soul which she doubt not be suffer in purgatory he promise not to forget her request but he perfectly gain the old woman heart by engage to watch during the whole of the approach night in the haunted chamber jacintha could find no term sufficiently strong to express her gratitude and the monk depart loaded with her benediction it be broad day when he return to the abbey hi first care be to communicate what have past to hi confident he felt too sincere a passion for antonia to have hear unmoved the prediction of her speedy death and he shudder at the idea of lose an object so dear to him upon this head matilda reassure him she confirm the argument which himself have already use she declare antonia to have be deceive by the wandering of her brain by the spleen which opprest her at the moment and by the natural turn of her mind to superstition and the marvellous a to jacinthas account the absurdity refute itself the abbot hesitate not to believe that she have fabricate the whole story either confuse by terror or hop to make him comply more readily with her request have overrule the monk apprehension matilda continue thus the prediction and the ghost be equally false but it must be your care ambrosio to verify the first antonia within three day must indeed be dead to the world but she must live for you her present illness and this fancy which she have take into her head will colour a plan which i have long meditate but which be impracticable without your procure access to antonia she shall be yours not for a single night but for ever all the vigilance of her duenna shall not avail her you shall riot unrestrained in the charm of your mistress this very day must the scheme be put in execution for you have no time to lose the nephew of the duke of medina celi prepare to demand antonia for hi bride in a few day she will be remove to the palace of her relation the marquis de la cisterna and there she will be secure from your attempt thus during your absence have i be inform by my spy who be ever employ in bring me intelligence for your service now then listen to me there be a juice extract from certain herb know but to few which bring on the person who drink it the exact image of death let this be administer to antonia you may easily find mean to pour a few drop into her medicine the effect will be throw her into strong convulsion for an hour after which her blood will gradually cease to flow and heart to beat a mortal paleness will spread itself over her feature and she will appear a corse to every eye she have no friend about her you may charge yourself unsuspected with the superintendence of her funeral and cause her to be bury in the vault of st clare their solitude and easy access render these cavern favourable to your design give antonia the soporific draught this evening eight and forty hour after she have drank it life will revive to her bosom she will then be absolutely in your power she will find all resistance unavailing and necessity will compel her to receive you in her arm antonia will be in my power exclaim the monk matilda you transport me at length then happiness will be mine and that happiness will be matildas gift will be the gift of friendship i shall clasp antonia in my arm far from every pry eye

for them herself however a she leave a third person in the room and expect to be absent but a few minute she believe that she risqued nothing in quit her post no sooner have she leave the room than ambrosio move towards the table on which stand antonias medicine it be place in a recess of the window the physician seat in an armedchair and employ in question hi patient pay no attention to the proceeding of the monk ambrosio seize the opportunity he draw out the fatal phial and let a few drop fall into the medicine he then hastily leave the table and return to the seat which he have quit

follow the same prescription which on the night before have procure her a refreshing sleep flora reply that the draught stand ready upon the table he advise the patient to take it without delay and then retire flora pour the medicine into a cup and present it to her mistress at that moment ambrosios courage fail him might not matilda have deceive him might not jealousy have persuade her to destroy her rival and substitute poison in the room of an opiate this idea appear so reasonable that he be on the point of prevent her from swallow the medicine hi resolution be adopt too late the cup be already empty and antonia restore it into flora hand no remedy be now to be find ambrosio could only expect the moment impatiently destine to decide upon antonias life or death upon hi own happiness or despair dread to create suspicion by hi stay or betray himself by hi mind agitation he take leave of hi victim and withdraw from the room antonia part from him with less cordiality than on the former night flora have represent to her mistress that to admit hi visit be to disobey her mother order she describe to her hi emotion on enter the room and the fire which sparkle in hi eye while he gaze upon her this have escape antonias observation but not her attendant who explain the monk design and their probable consequence in term much clear than elviras though not quite so delicate have succeed in alarm her young lady and persuade her to treat him more distantly than she have do hitherto the idea of obey her mother will at once determine antonia though she grieve at lose hi society she conquer herself sufficiently to receive the monk with some degree of reserve and coldness she thank him with respect and gratitude for hi former visit but do not invite hi repeat them in future it now be not the friar interest to solicit admission to her presence and he take leave of her a if not design to return fully persuade that the acquaintance which she dread be now at an end flora be so much work upon by hi easy compliance that she begin to doubt the justice of her suspicion a she light him down stair she thank him for have endeavour to root out from antonias mind her superstitious terror of the spectre prediction she add that a he seem interested in donna antonias welfare should any change take place in her situation she would be careful to let him know it the monk in reply take pain to raise hi voice hop that jacintha would hear it in this he succeed a he reach the foot of the stair with hi conductress the landlady fail not to make her appearance why

and what not for god sake your holiness do not leave me in such a woeful condition on my bended knee i beseech you to keep your promise watch this night in the haunted chamber lay the apparition in the red sea and jacintha remembers you in her prayer to the last day of her existence this request ambrosio expect and desire yet he affect to raise objection and to seem unwilling to keep hi word he tell jacintha that the ghost exist nowhere but in her own brain and that her insist upon hi stay all night in the house be ridiculous and useless jacintha be obstinate she be not to be convince and press him so urgently not to leave her a prey to the devil that at length he grant her request all this show of resistance impose not upon flora who be naturally of a suspicious temper she suspect the monk to be act a part very contrary to hi own inclination and that he wish for no good than to remain where he be she even go so far a to believe that jacintha be in hi interest and the poor old woman be immediately set down a no good than a procuress while she applaud herself for have penetrate into this plot against her lady honour she resolve in secret to render it fruitless so then say she to the abbot with a look halfsatirical and half indignant so then you mean to stay here tonight do so in god name nobody will prevent you sit up to watch for the ghost arrival i shall sit up too and the lord grant that i may see nothing bad than a ghost i quit not donna antonias bedside during this bless night let me see any one dare to enter the room and be he mortal or immortal be he ghost devil or man i warrant hi repenting that ever he cross the threshold this hint be sufficiently strong and ambrosio understand it meaning but instead of show that he perceive her suspicion he reply mildly that he approve the duenna precaution and advise her to persevere in her intention this she assure him faithfully that he might depend upon her do jacintha then conduct him into the chamber where the ghost have appear and flora return to her lady jacintha open the door of the haunted room with a trembling hand she venture to peep in but the wealth of india would not have tempt her to cross the threshold she give the taper to the monk wish him well through the adventure and hasten to be go ambrosio enter he bolt the door place the light upon the table and seat himself in the chair which on the former night have sustain antonia in spite of matildas assurance that the spectre be a mere creation of fancy hi mind be impress with a certain mysterious horror he in vain endeavour to shake it off the silence of the night the story of the apparition the chamber wainscot with dark oak pannells the recollection which it bring with it of the murder elvira and hi incertitude respect the nature of the drop give by him to antonia make him feel uneasy at hi present situation but he think much less of the spectre than of the poison should he have destroy the only object which render life dear to him should the ghost prediction prove true should antonia in three day be no more and he the wretched cause of her death the supposition be too horrible to dwell upon he drive away these dreadful image and as often they present themselves again before him matilda have assure him that the effect of the opiate would be speedy he listen with fear yet with eagerness expect to hear some disturbance in the adjoining chamber all be still silent he conclude that the drop have not begin to operate great be the stake for which he now play a moment would suffice to decide upon hi misery or happiness matilda have teach him the mean of ascertain that life be not extinct for ever upon this assay depend all hi hope with every instant hi impatience redouble hi terror grow more lively hi anxiety more awake unable to bear this state of incertitude he endeavour to divert it by substitute the thought of other to hi own the book a be before mention be range upon shelf near the table this stand exactly opposite to the bed which be place in an alcove near the closet door ambrosio take down a volume and seat himself by the table but hi attention wander from the page before him antonias image and that of the murdered elvira persist to force themselves before hi imagination still he continue to read though hi eye run over the character without hi mind be conscious of their import such be hi occupation when he fancy that he hear a footstep he turn hi head but nobody be to be see he resume hi book but in a few minute after the same sound be repeat and follow by a rustle noise close behind him he now start from hi seat and look round him perceive the closet door stand halfunclosed on hi first enter the room he have try to open it but find it bolt on the inside how be this say he to himself how come this door unfasten he advance towards it he push it open and look into the closet no one be there while he stand irresolute he think that he distinguish a groaning in the adjacent chamber it be antonias and he suppose that the drop begin to take effect but upon listen more attentively he find the noise to be cause by jacintha who have fall asleep by the lady bedside and be snore most lustily ambrosio draw back and return to the other room muse upon the sudden opening of the closet door for which he strive in vain to account he pace the chamber up and down in silence at length he stop and the bed attract hi attention the curtain of the recess be but halfdrawn he sigh involuntarily that bed say he in a low voice that bed be elviras there have she past many a quiet night for she be good and innocent how sound must have be her sleep and yet now she sleep sounder doe she indeed sleep oh god grant that she may what if she rise from her grave at this sad and silent hour what if she break the bond of the tomb and glide angrily before my blasted eye oh i never could support the sight again to see her form distort by die agony her bloodswollen vein her livid countenance her eye burst from their socket with pain to hear her speak of future punishment menace me with heaven vengeance tax me with the crime i have commit with those i be go to commit great god what be that a he utter these word hi eye which be fix upon the bed saw the curtain shake gently backwards and forward the apparition be recall to hi mind and he almost fancy that he behold elviras visionary form recline upon the bed a few moment consideration suffice to reassure him it be only the wind say he recover himself again he pace the chamber but an involuntary movement of awe and inquietude constantly lead hi eye towards the alcove he draw near it with irresolution he pause before he ascend the few step which lead to it he put out hi hand thrice to remove the curtain and as often draw it back absurd terror he cry at length ashamed of hi own weakness hastily he mount the step when a figure drest in white start from the alcove and glide by him make with precipitation towards the closet madness and despair now supply the monk with that courage of which he have till then be destitute he fly down the step pursue the apparition and attempt to grasp it ghost or devil i hold you he exclaim and seize the spectre by the arm oh christ jesus cry a shrill voice holy father how you gripe me i protest that i mean no harm this address as well a the arm which he hold convince the abbot that the suppose ghost be substantial flesh and blood he draw the intruder towards the table and hold up the light discover the feature of madona flora incense at have be betray by this trifling cause into fear so ridiculous he ask her sternly what business have bring her to that chamber flora ashamed at be find out and terrify at the severity of ambrosios look fell upon her knee and promise to make a full confession i protest reverend father say she that i be quite grieve at have disturb you nothing be far from my intention i mean to get out of the room as quietly a i get in and

leave old dame jacintha sit by my lady bed and i venture to steal into the closet being unwilling to interrupt you i content myself at first with put my eye to the keyhole but a i could see nothing by this mean i undrew the bolt and while your back be turn to the alcove i whipt me in softly and silently here i lay snug behind the curtain till your reverence find me out and seize me ere i have time to regain the closet door this be the whole truth i assure you holy father and i beg your pardon a thousand time for my impertinence during this speech the abbot have time to recollect himself he be satisfy with read the penitent spy a lecture upon the danger of curiosity and the meanness of the action in which she have be just discover flora declare herself fully persuade that she have do wrong she promise never to be guilty of the same fault again and be retire very humble and contrite to antonias chamber when the closet door be suddenly thrown open and in rushed jacintha pale and out of breath oh father father she cry in a voice almost choaked with terror what shall i do what shall i do here be a fine piece of work nothing but misfortune nothing but dead people and die people oh i

cast a spell upon it upon me and upon all about me poor donna antonia there she lie in just such convulsion a kill her mother the ghost tell her true i be sure the ghost have tell her true flora run or rather flew to her lady chamber ambrosio follow her hi bosom tremble with hope and apprehension they find antonia a jacintha have describe tear by rack convulsion from which they in vain endeavour to relieve her the monk dispatch jacintha to the abbey in all haste and commission her to bring father pablos back with her without lose a moment i will go for him reply jacintha and tell him to come hither but a to bring him myself i shall do no such thing i be sure that the house be bewitch and burn me if ever i set foot in it again with this resolution she set out for the monastery and deliver to father pablos the abbot order she then betook herself to the house of old simon gonzalez whom she resolve never to quit till she have make him her husband and hi dwell her own father pablos have no

her dissolution be approach and that nothing could save her worthy ambrosio she say in a feeble voice while she press hi hand to her lip i be now at liberty to express how grateful be my heart for your attention and kindness i be upon the bed of death yet an hour and i shall be no more i may therefore acknowledge without restraint that to relinquish your society be very painful to me but such
