return undiscovered to the abbey ambrosios mind be fill with the most pleasing image he be wilfully blind to the danger of expose himself to antonias charm he only remember the pleasure which her society have afford him and rejoice in the prospect of that pleasure be repeat he fail not to profit by elviras indisposition to obtain a sight of her daughter every day at first he bound hi wish to inspire antonia with friendship but no sooner be he convince that she felt that sentiment in it full extent than hi aim become more decided and hi attention assume a warmer colour the innocent familiarity with which she treat him encourage hi desire grown use to her modesty it no longer command the same respect and awe he still admire it but it only make him more anxious to deprive her of that quality which form her principal charm warmth of passion and natural penetration of which latter unfortunately both for himself and antonia he possess an ample share supply a knowledge of the art of seduction he easily distinguish the emotion which be favourable to hi design and seize every mean with avidity of infuse corruption into antonias bosom this he find no easy matter extreme simplicity prevent her from perceive the aim to which the monk insinuation tend but the excellent moral which she owe to elviras care the solidity and correctness of her understanding and a strong sense of what be right implant in her heart by nature make her feel that hi precept must be faulty by a few simple word she frequently overthrow the whole bulk of hi sophistical argument and make him conscious how weak they be when oppose to virtue and truth on such occasion he take refuge in hi eloquence he overpower her with a torrent of philosophical paradox to which not understand them it be impossible for her to reply and thus though he do not convince her that hi reasoning be just he at least prevent her from discover it to be false he perceive that her respect for hi judgment augment daily and doubt not with time to bring her to the point desire he be not unconscious that hi attempt be highly criminal he saw clearly the baseness of seduce the innocent girl but hi passion be too violent to permit hi abandon hi design he resolve to pursue it let the consequence be what they might he depend upon find antonia in some unguarded moment and see no other man admit into her society nor hear any mention either by her or by elvira he imagine that her young heart be still unoccupied while he wait for the opportunity of satisfy hi unwarrantable lust every day increase hi coldness for matilda not a little be this occasion by the consciousness of hi fault to her to hide them from her he be not sufficiently master of himself yet he dread l in a transport of jealous rage she should betray the secret on which hi character and even hi life depend matilda could not but remark hi indifference he be conscious that she remark it and fear her reproach shun her studiously yet when he could not avoid her her mildness might have convince him that he have nothing to dread from her resentment she have resume the character of the gentle interesting rosario she tax him not with ingratitude but her eye fill with involuntary tear and the soft melancholy of her countenance and voice uttered complaint far more touching than word could have convey ambrosio be not unmoved by her sorrow but unable to remove it cause he forbear to show that it affect him a her conduct convince him that he need not fear her vengeance he continue to neglect her and avoid her company with care matilda saw that she in vain attempt to regain hi affection yet she stifle the impulse of resentment and continue to treat her inconstant lover with her former fondness and attention by degree elviras constitution recover itself she be no long trouble with convulsion and antonia cease to tremble for her mother ambrosio behold this reestablish with displeasure he saw that elviras knowledge of the world would not be the dupe of hi sanctified demeanour and that she would easily perceive hi view upon her daughter he resolve therefore before she quit her chamber to try the extent of hi influence over the innocent antonia one evening when he have find elvira almost perfectly restore to health he quit her early than be hi usual custom not find antonia in the antichamber he venture to follow her to her own it be only separated from her mother by a closet in which flora the waitingwoman generally sleep antonia sit upon a sopha with her back towards the door and read attentively she hear not hi approach till he have seat himself by her she start and welcome him with a look of pleasure then rise she would have conduct him to the sittingroom but ambrosio take her hand oblige her by gentle violence to resume her place she comply without difficulty she know not that there be more impropriety in converse with him in one room than another she think herself equally secure of hi principle and her own and have replace herself upon the sopha she begin to prattle to him with her usual ease and vivacity he examine the book which she have be read and have now place upon the table it be the bible how say the friar to himself antonia read the bible and be still so ignorant but upon a further inspection he find that elvira have make exactly the same remark that prudent mother while she admire the beauty of the sacred writing be convince that unrestricted no reading more improper could be permit a young woman many of the narrative can only tend to excite idea the bad calculate for a female breast every thing be call plainly and roundly by it name and the annals of a brothel would scarcely furnish a great choice of indecent expression yet this be the book which young woman be recommend to study which be put into the hand of child able to comprehend little more than those passage of which they have well remain ignorant and which but too frequently inculcate the first rudiment of vice and give the first alarm to the still sleep passion of this be elvira so fully convinced that she would have prefer put into her daughter hand amadis de gaul or the valiant champion tirante the white and would sooner have authorise her study the lewd exploit of don galaor or the lascivious joke of the damsel plazer di mi vida she have in consequence make two resolution respect the bible the first be that antonia should not read it till she be of an age to feel it beauty and profit by it morality the second that it should be copy out with her own hand and all improper passage either alter or omit she have adhere to this determination and such be the bible which antonia be read it have be lately deliver to her and she peruse it with an avidity with a delight that be inexpressible ambrosio perceive hi mistake and replace the book upon the table antonia spoke of her mother health with all the enthusiastic joy of a youthful heart i admire your filial affection say the abbot it prove the excellence and sensibility of your character it promise a treasure to him whom heaven have destine to possess your affection the breast so capable of fondness for a parent what

at hi action surprize at first deprive her of the power of resistance at length recover herself she strive to escape from hi embrace father ambrosio she cry release me for god sake but the licentious monk heed not her prayer he persist in hi design and proceed to take still great liberty antonia pray wept and struggle terrified to the extreme though at what she know not she exert all her strength to repulse the friar and be on the point of shriek for assistance when the chamber door be suddenly thrown open ambrosio have just sufficient presence of mind to be sensible of hi danger reluctantly he quit hi prey and start hastily from the couch antonia utter an exclamation of joy fly towards the door and find herself clasp in the arm of her mother alarmed at some of the abbot speech which antonia have innocently repeat elvira resolve to ascertain the truth of her suspicion she have know enough of mankind not to be impose upon by the monk repute virtue she reflect on several circumstance which though trifle on be put together seem to authorize her fear hi frequent visit which as far a she could see be confine to her family hi evident emotion whenever she speak of antonia hi be in the full prime and heat of manhood and above all hi pernicious philosophy communicate to her by antonia and which accord but ill with hi conversation in her presence all these circumstance inspire her with doubt respect the purity of ambrosios friendship in consequence she resolve when he should next be alone with antonia to endeavour at surprizing him her plan have succeed ti true that when she enter the room he have already abandon hi prey but the disorder of her daughter dress and the shame and confusion stamp upon the friar countenance suffice to prove that her suspicion be but too wellfounded however she be too prudent to make those suspicion know she judge that to unmask the imposter would be no easy matter the public be so much prejudice in hi favour and have but few friend she think it dangerous to make herself so powerful an enemy she affect therefore not to remark hi agitation seat herself tranquilly upon the sopha assign some trifle reason for have quit her room unexpectedly and converse on various subject with seem confidence and ease reassure by her behaviour the monk begin to recover himself he strive to answer elvira without appear embarrassed but he be still too great a novice in dissimulation and he felt that he must look confused and awkward he soon break off the conversation and rise to depart what be hi vexation when on take leave elvira tell him in polite term that be now perfectly reestablish she think it an injustice to deprive other of hi company who might be more in need of it she assure him of her eternal gratitude for the benefit which during her illness she have derive from hi society and exhortation and she lament that her domestic affair as well a the multitude of business which hi situation must of necessity impose upon him would in future deprive her of the pleasure of hi visit though deliver in the mild language this hint be too plain to be mistake still he be prepare to put in a remonstrance when an expressive

with rage and shame with bitterness and disappointment antonias mind felt relieve by hi departure yet she could not help lament that she be never to see him more elvira also felt a secret sorrow she have receive too much pleasure from think him her friend not to regret the necessity of change her opinion but her mind be too much accustom to the fallacy of worldly friendship to permit her present disappointment to weigh upon it long she now endeavour to make her daughter aware of the risque which she have ran but she be oblige to treat the subject with caution l in remove the bandage of ignorance the veil of innocence should be rent away she therefore content herself with warn antonia to be upon her guard and order her should the abbot persist in hi visit never to receive them but in company with this injunction antonia promise to comply ambrosio hasten to hi cell he close the door after him and throw himself upon the bed in despair the impulse of desire the sting of disappointment the shame of detection and the fear of be publicly unmask render hi bosom a scene of the most horrible confusion he know not what course to pursue debarred the presence of antonia he have no hope of satisfy that passion which be now become a part of hi existence he reflect that hi secret be in a woman power he tremble with apprehension when he behold the precipice before him and with rage when he think that have it not be for elvira he should now have possess the object of hi desire with the direct imprecation he vow vengeance against her he swear that cost what it would he still would possess antonia start from the bed he pace the chamber with disordered step howl with impotent fury dash himself violently against the wall and indulge all the transport of rage and madness he be still under the influence of this storm of passion when he hear a gentle knock at the door of hi cell conscious that hi voice must have be hear he dare not refuse admittance to the importuner he strive to compose himself and to hide hi agitation having in some degree succeed he draw back the bolt the door open and matilda appear at this precise moment there be no one with whose

know to me nay i be constantly with you in some degree thanks to this precious gift with these word she draw from beneath her habit a mirror of polished steel the border of which be mark with various strange and unknown character amidst all my sorrow amidst all my regret for your coldness i be sustain from despair by the virtue of this talisman on pronounce certain word the person appear in it on whom the observer thought be bent thus though i be exile from your sight you ambrosio be ever present to mine the friar curiosity be excite strongly what you relate be incredible matilda be you not amuse yourself with my credulity be your own eye the judge she put the mirror into hi hand curiosity induce him to take it and love to wish that antonia might appear matilda pronounce the magic word immediately a thick smoke rise from the character trace upon the border and spread itself over the surface it disperse again gradually a confused mixture of colour and image present themselves to the friar eye which at length arrange themselves in their proper place he behold in miniature antonias lovely form the scene be a small closet belonging to her apartment she be undress to bathe herself the long tress of her hair be already bind up the amorous monk have full opportunity to observe the voluptuous contour and admirable symmetry of her person she throw off her last garment and advance to the bath prepare for her she put her foot into the water it strike cold and she draw it back again though unconscious of be observe an inbred sense of modesty induce her to veil her charm and she stand hesitate upon the brink in the attitude of the venus de medici at this moment a tame linnet flew towards her nestle it head between her breast and nibble them in wanton play the smile antonia strove in vain to shake off the bird and at length raise her hand to drive it from it delightful harbour ambrosio could bear no more hi desire be work up to phrenzy i yield he cry dash the mirror upon the ground matilda i follow you do with me what you will she wait not to hear hi consent repeat it be already midnightshe fly to her cell and soon return with her little basket and the key of the cemetery which have remain in her possession since her first visit to the vault she give the monk no time for reflection come she say and take hi hand follow me and witness the effect of your resolve this say she draw him hastily along they pass into the buryingground unobserved open the door of the sepulchre and find themselves at the head of the subterraneous staircase a yet the beam of the full moon have guide their step but that resource now fail them matilda have neglect to provide herself with a lamp still hold ambrosios hand she descend the marble step but the profound obscurity with which they be overspread oblige them to walk slow and cautiously you tremble say matilda to her companion fear not the destined spot be near they reach the foot of the staircase and continue to proceed feel their way along the wall on turn a corner suddenly they descry faint gleam of light which seem burning at a distance thither they bend their step the ray proceed from a small sepulchral lamp which flame unceasingly before the statue of st clare it ting with dim and cheerless beam the massy column which support the roof but be too feeble to dissipate the thick gloom in which the vault above be bury matilda take the lamp wait for me say she to the friar in a few moment i be here again with these word she hasten into one of the passage which branch in various direction from this spot and form a sort of labyrinth ambrosio be now left alone darkness the most profound surround him and encourage the doubt which begin to revive in hi bosom he have be hurry away by the delirium of the moment the shame of betray hi terror while in matildas presence have induce him to repress them but now that he be abandon to himself they resume their former ascendancy he tremble at the scene which he be soon to witness he know not how far the delusion of magic might operate upon hi mind and possibly might force him to some deed whose commission would make the breach between himself and heaven irreparable in this fearful dilemma he would have implore god assistance but be conscious that he have forfeit all claim to such protection gladly would he have return to the abbey but a he have past through innumerable cavern and wind passage the attempt of regain the stair be hopeless hi fate be determine no possibility of escape present itself he therefore combat hi apprehension and call every argument to hi succour which might enable him to support the try scene with fortitude he reflect that antonia would be the reward of hi daring he inflame hi imagination by enumerate her charm he persuade himself that a matilda have observe he always should have time sufficient for repentance and that a he employ her assistance not that of the daemon the crime of sorcery could not be lay to hi charge he have read much respect witchcraft he understand that unless a formal act be sign renounce hi claim to salvation satan would have no power over him he be fully determine not to execute any such act whatever threat might be use or advantage hold out to him such be hi meditation while wait for matilda they be interrupt by a low murmur which seem at no great distance from him he be startle he listen some minute past in silence after which the murmur be repeat it appear to be the groaning of one in pain in any other situation this circumstance would only have excite hi attention and curiosity in the present hi predominant sensation be that of terror hi imagination totally engross by the idea of sorcery and spirit he fancy that some unquiet ghost be wander near him or els that matilda have fall a victim to her presumption and be perish under the cruel fang of the daemon the noise seem not to approach but continue to be hear at interval sometimes it become more audible doubtless a the suffering of the person who utter the groan become more acute and insupportable ambrosio now and then think that he could distinguish accent and once in particular he be almost convinced that he hear a faint voice exclaim god oh god no hope no succour yet deep groan follow these word they die away gradually and universal silence again prevail what can this mean think the bewildered monk at that moment an idea which flash into hi mind almost petrify him with horror he start and shudder at himself should it be possible he groan involuntarily should it but be possible oh what a monster be i he wish to resolve hi doubt and to repair hi fault if it be not too late already but these generous and compassionate sentiment be soon put to flight by the return of matilda he forget the groaning sufferer and remember nothing but the danger and embarrassment of hi own situation the light of the return lamp gild the wall and in a few moment after matilda stand beside him she have quit her religious habit she be now cloathed in a long sable robe on which be trace in gold embroidery a variety of unknown character it be fasten by a girdle of precious stone in which be fix a poignard her neck and arm be uncover in her hand she bore a golden wand her hair be loose and flow wildly upon her shoulder her eye sparkle with terrific expression and her whole demeanour be calculate to inspire the beholder with awe and admiration follow me she say to the monk in a low and solemn voice all be ready hi limb tremble while he obey her she lead him through various narrow passage and on every side a they past along the beam of the lamp display none but the most revolting object skull bone graf and image whose eye seem to glare on them with horror and surprize at length they reach a spacious cavern whose lofty roof the eye seek in vain to discover a profound obscurity hover through the void damp vapours strike cold to the friar heart and he listen sadly to the blast while it howl along the lonely vault here matilda stop she turn to ambrosio hi cheek and lip be pale with apprehension by a glance of mingle scorn and anger she reprove hi pusillanimity but she speak not she place the lamp upon the ground near the basket she motion that ambrosio should be silent and begin the mysterious rite she draw a circle round him another round herself and then take a small phial from the basket pour a few drop upon the ground before her she bent over the place mutter some indistinct sentence and immediately a pale sulphurous flame arise from the ground it increase by degree and at length spread it wave over the whole surface the circle alone except in which stand matilda and the monk it then ascend the huge column of unhewn stone glide along the roof and form the cavern into an immense chamber totally cover with blue tremble fire it emit no heat on the contrary the extreme chill of the place seem to augment with every moment matilda continue her incantation at interval she take various article from the basket the nature and name of most of which be unknown to the friar but among the few which he distinguish he particularly observe three human finger and an agnus dei which she break in piece she throw them all into the flame which burn before her and they be instantly consume the monk behold her with anxious curiosity suddenly she utter a loud and pierce shriek she appear to be seize with an access of delirium she tear her hair beat her bosom use the most frantic gesture and draw the poignard from her girdle plunge it into her left arm the blood gush out plentifully and a she stand on the brink of the circle she take care that it should fall on the outside the flame retire from the spot on which the blood be pour a volume of dark cloud rise slowly from the ensanguined earth and ascend gradually till it reach the vault of the cavern at the same time a clap of thunder be hear the echo peal fearfully along the subterraneous passage and the ground shake beneath the foot of the enchantress it be now that ambrosio repent of hi rashness the solemn singularity of the charm have prepare him for something strange and horrible he wait with fear for the spirit appearance whose come be announce by thunder and earthquake he look wildly round him expect that some dreadful apparition would meet hi eye the sight of which would drive him mad a cold shivering seize hi body and he sink upon one knee unable to support himself he come exclaimed matilda in a joyful accent ambrosio start and expect the daemon with terror what be hi surprize when the thunder ceasing to roll a full strain of melodious music sound in the air at the same time the cloud disperse and he behold a figure more beautiful than fancy pencil ever draw it be a youth seemingly scarce eighteen the perfection of whose form and face be unrivalled he be perfectly naked a bright star sparkle upon hi forehead two crimson wing extend themselves from hi shoulder and hi silken lock be confine by a band of manycoloured fire which play round hi head form themselves into a variety of figure and shone with a brilliance far surpass that of precious stone circlet of diamond be fasten round hi arm and ankle and in hi right hand he bore a silver branch imitate myrtle hi form shone with dazzling glory he be surround by cloud of rosecoloured light and at the moment that he appear a refresh air breathe perfume through the cavern enchanted at a vision so contrary to hi expectation ambrosio gaze upon the spirit with delight and wonder yet however beautiful the figure he could not but remark a wildness in the daemon eye and a mysterious melancholy impress upon hi feature betray the fallen angel and inspire the spectator with secret awe the music cease matilda address herself to the spirit she speak in a language unintelligible to the monk and be answer in the same she seem to insist upon something which the daemon be unwilling to grant he frequently dart upon ambrosio angry glance and at such time the friar heart sank within him matilda appear to grow incensed she speak in a loud and command tone and her gesture declare that she be threaten him with her vengeance her menace have the desire effect the spirit sink upon hi knee and with a submissive air present to her the branch of myrtle no sooner have she receive it than the music be again heard a thick cloud spread itself over the apparition the blue flame disappear and total obscurity reign through the cave the abbot move not from hi place hi faculty be all bind up in pleasure anxiety and surprize at length the darkness disperse he perceive matilda stand near him in her religious habit with the myrtle in her hand no trace of the incantation and the vault be only illuminate by the faint ray of the sepulchral lamp i have succeed say matilda though with more difficulty than i expect lucifer whom i summon to my assistance be at first unwilling to obey my command to enforce hi compliance i be constrain to have recourse to my strong charm they have produce the desired effect but i have engage never more to invoke hi agency in your favour beware then how you employ an opportunity which never will return my magic art will now be of no use to you in future you can only hope for supernatural aid by invoke the daemon yourself and accept the condition of their service this you will never do
