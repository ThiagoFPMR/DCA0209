cause most warmly in truth she merit to have friend and i wish i could prevail upon you to consider her youth and her peculiar situation she seem sensible of her fault the excess of her grief prove her penitence and i be convinced that her tear flow more from contrition than fear of punishment reverend mother would you be persuade to mitigate the severity of your sentence would you but deign to overlook this first transgression i offer myself a the pledge of her future conduct overlook it say you mother camilla you amaze me what after disgrace me in the presence of madrid idol of the very man on whom i most wish to impress an idea of the strictness of my discipline how despicable must i have appear to the reverend abbot no mother no i never can forgive the insult i can not better convince ambrosio that i abhor such crime than by punish that of agnes with all the rigour of which our severe law admit cease then your supplication they will all be unavailing my resolution be take tomorrow agnes shall be make a terrible example of my justice and resentment the mother camilla seem not to give up the point but by this time the nun be out of hear the prioress unlock the door which communicate with st clares chapel and have enter with her companion close it again after them matilda now ask who be this agnes with whom the prioress be thus incense and what connexion she could have with ambrosio he relate her adventure and he add that since that time hi idea have undergone a thorough revolution he now felt much compassion for the unfortunate nun i design say he to request an audience of the domina tomorrow and use every mean of obtain a mitigation of her sentence beware of what you do interrupted matilda your sudden change of sentiment may naturally create surprize and may give birth to suspicion which it be most our interest to avoid rather redouble your outward austerity and thunder out menace against the error of other the good to conceal your own abandon the nun to her fate your interfering might be dangerous and her imprudence merit to be punish she be unworthy to enjoy love pleasure who have not wit enough to conceal them but in discuss this trifle subject i waste moment which be precious the night fly apace and much must be do before morning the nun be retire all be safe give me the lamp ambrosio i must descend alone into these cavern wait here and if any one approach warn me by your voice but a you value your existence presume not to follow me your life would fall a victim to your imprudent curiosity thus say she advance towards the sepulchre

descend it ambrosio remain above watch the faint beam of the lamp a they still proceed up the stair they disappear and he find himself in total darkness leave to himself he could not reflect without surprize on the sudden change in matildas character and sentiment but a few day have past since she appear the mild and soft of her sex devote to hi will and look up to him a to a superior being now she assume a sort of courage and manliness in her manner and discourse but illcalculated to please him she speak no long to insinuate but command he find himself unable to cope with her in argument and be unwillingly oblige to confess the superiority of her judgment every moment convince him of the astonishing power of her mind but what she gain in the opinion of the man she lose with interest in the affection of the lover he regret rosario the fond the gentle and submissive he grieve that matilda prefer the virtue of hi sex to those of her own and when he think of her expression respect the devoted nun he could not help blame them a cruel and unfeminine pity be a sentiment so natural so appropriate to the female character that it be scarcely a merit for a woman to possess it but to be without it be a grievous crime ambrosio could not easily forgive hi mistress for be deficient in this amiable quality however though he blame her insensibility he felt the truth of her observation and though he pity sincerely the unfortunate agnes he resolve to drop the idea of interpose in her behalf near an hour have elapse since matilda descend into the cavern still she return not ambrosios curiosity be excite he draw near the staircase he listen all be silent except that at interval he catch the sound of matildas voice a it wind along the subterraneous passage and be reecho by the sepulchre vault roofs she be at too great a distance for him to distinguish her word and ere they reach him they be deaden into a low murmur he long to penetrate into this mystery he resolve to disobey her injunction and follow her into the cavern he advance to the staircase he have already descend some step when hi courage fail him he remember matildas menace if he infringe her order and hi bosom be fill with a secret unaccountable awe he return up the stair resume hi former station and wait impatiently for the conclusion of this adventure suddenly he be sensible of a violent shock an earthquake rock the ground the column which support the roof under which he stand be so strongly shake that every moment menace him with it fall and at the same moment he hear a loud and tremendous burst of thunder it cease and hi eye be fix upon the staircase he saw a bright column of light flash along the cavern beneath it be see but for an instant no sooner do it disappear than all be once more quiet and obscure profound darkness again surround him and the silence of night be only break by the whir bat a she flit slowly by him with every instant ambrosios amazement increase another hour elapse after which the same light again appear and be lose again a suddenly it be accompany by a strain of sweet but solemn music which a it steal through the vault below inspire the monk with mingled delight and terror it have not long be hush when he hear matildas step upon the staircase she ascend from the cavern the most lively joy animate her beautiful feature did you see any thing she ask

enslave by the prejudice of education and superstition might make you shudder at the idea of that which experience have teach me to prize and value at present you be unfit to be trust with a secret of such importance but the strength of your judgment and the curiosity which i rejoice to see sparkle in your eye make me hope that you will one day deserve my confidence till that period arrive restrain your impatience remember that you have give me your solemn oath never to enquire into this nights adventure i insist upon your keep this oath for though she add smile while she seal hi lip with a wanton kiss though i forgive your break your vow to heaven i expect you to keep your vow to me the friar return the embrace which have set hi blood on fire the luxurious and unbounded excess of the former night be renew and they separate not till the bell rang for matins the same pleasure be frequently repeat the monk rejoice in the feigned rosario unexpected recovery and none of them suspect hi real sex the abbot possess hi mistress in tranquillity and perceive hi frailty unsuspected abandon himself to hi passion in full security shame and remorse no longer torment him frequent repetition make him familiar with sin and hi bosom become proof against the sting of conscience in these sentiment he be encourage by matilda but she soon be aware that she have satiate her lover by the unbounded freedom of her caress her charm become accustom to him they cease to excite the same desire which at first they have inspire the delirium of passion be past he have leisure to observe every trifling defect where none be to be find satiety make him fancy them the monk be glut with the fullness of pleasure a week have scarcely elapse before he be weary of hi paramour hi warm constitution still make him seek in her arm the gratification of hi lust but when the moment of passion be over he quit her with disgust and hi humour naturally inconstant make him sigh impatiently for variety possession which cloy man only increase the affection of woman matilda with every succeed day grow more attached to the friar since he have obtain her favour he be become dearer to her than ever and she felt grateful to him for the pleasure in which they have equally be sharer unfortunately a her passion grow ardent ambrosios grow cold the very mark of her fondness excite hi disgust and it excess serve to extinguish the flame which already burn but feebly in hi bosom matilda could not but remark that her society seem to him daily less agreeable he be inattentive while she speak her musical talent which she possess in perfection have lose the power of amuse him or if he deign to praise them hi compliment be evidently force and cold he no longer gazed upon her with affection or applaud her sentiment with a lover partiality this matilda well perceive and redouble her effort to revive those sentiment which he once have felt she could not but fail since he consider a importunity the pain which she take to please him and be disgust by the very mean which she use to recall the wanderer still however their illicit commerce continue but it be clear that he be lead to her arm not by love but the craving of brutal appetite hi constitution make a woman necessary to him and matilda be the only one with whom he could indulge hi passion safely in spite of her beauty he gaze upon every other female with more desire but fear that hi hypocrisy should be make public he confine hi inclination to hi own breast it be by no mean hi nature to be timid but hi education have impress hi mind with fear so strongly that apprehension be now become part of hi character have hi youth be pass in the world he would have show himself possess of many brilliant and manly quality he be naturally enterprizing firm and fearless he have a warrior heart and he might have shine with splendour at the head of an army there be no want of generosity in hi nature the wretched never fail to find in him a compassionate auditor hi ability be quick and shin and hi judgment vast solid and decisive with such qualification he would have be an ornament to hi country that he possess them he have give proof in hi early infancy and hi parent have behold hi dawn virtue with the fond delight and admiration unfortunately while yet a child he be deprive of those parent he fell into the power of a relation whose only wish about him be never to hear of him more for that purpose he give him in charge to hi friend the former superior of the capuchin the abbot a very monk use all hi endeavour to persuade the boy that happiness exist not without the wall of a convent he succeed fully to deserve admittance into the order of st francis be ambrosios high ambition hi instructor carefully repress those virtue whose grandeur and disinterestedness be illsuited to the cloister instead of universal benevolence he adopt a selfish partiality for hi own particular establishment he be teach to consider compassion for the error of other a a crime of the black dye the noble frankness of hi temper be exchange for servile humility and in order to break hi natural spirit the monk terrify hi young mind by place before him all the horror with which superstition could furnish them they paint to him the torment of the damned in colour the most dark terrible and fantastic and threaten him at the slight fault with eternal perdition no wonder that hi imagination constantly dwell upon these fearful object should have render hi character timid and apprehensive add to this that hi long absence from the great world and total unacquaintance with the common danger of life make him form of them an idea far more dismal than the reality while the monk be busy in root out hi virtue and narrow hi sentiment they allow every vice which have fall to hi share to arrive at full perfection he be suffer to be proud vain ambitious and disdainful he be jealous of hi equal and despise all merit but hi own he be implacable when offend and cruel in hi revenge still in spite of the pain take to pervert them hi natural good quality would occasionally break through the gloom cast over them so carefully at such time the contest for superiority between hi real and acquire character be strike and unaccountable to those unacquainted with hi original disposition he pronounce the most severe sentence upon offender which the moment after compassion induce him to mitigate he undertake the most daring enterprizes which the fear of their consequence soon oblige him to abandon hi inborn genius dart a brilliant light upon subject the most obscure and almost instantaneously hi superstition replunged them in darkness more profound than that from which they have just be rescue hi brother monk regard him a a superior being remark not this contradiction in their idol conduct they be persuade that what he do must be right and suppose him to have good reason for change hi resolution the fact be that the different sentiment with which education and nature have inspire him be combat in hi bosom it remain for hi passion which a yet no opportunity have call into play to decide the victory unfortunately hi passion be the very bad judge to whom he could possibly have apply hi monastic seclusion have till now be in hi favour since it give him no room for discover hi bad quality the superiority of hi talent raise him too far above hi companion to permit hi be jealous of them hi exemplary piety persuasive eloquence and please manner have secure him universal esteem and consequently he have no injury to revenge hi ambition be justify by hi acknowledged merit and hi pride consider a no more than proper confidence he never saw much less conversed with the other sex he be ignorant of the pleasure in woman power to bestow and if he read in the course of hi study that men be fond he smile and wonder how for a time spare diet frequent watching and severe penance cool and represt the natural warmth of hi constitution but no sooner do opportunity present itself no sooner do he catch a glimpse of joy to which he be still a stranger than religion barrier be too feeble to resist the overwhelming torrent of hi desire all impediment yield before the force of hi temperament warm sanguine and voluptuous in the excess a yet hi other passion lay dormant but they only need to be once awaken to display themselves with violence a great and irresistible he continue to be the admiration of madrid the enthusiasm create by hi eloquence seem rather to increase than diminish every thursday which be the only day when he appear in public the capuchin cathedral be crowd with auditor and hi discourse be always receive with the same approbation he be name confessor to all the chief family in madrid and no one be count fashionable who be injoined penance by any other than ambrosio in hi resolution of never stir out of hi convent he still persist this circumstance create a still great opinion of hi sanctity and selfdenial above all the woman sing forth hi praise loudly less influenced by devotion than by hi noble countenance majestic air and wellturned graceful figure the abbey door be throng with carriage from morning to night and the noble and fair dame of madrid confess to the abbot their secret peccadilloes the eye of the luxurious friar devour their charm have

thought never once enter their imagination the climate heat ti well know operate with no small influence upon the constitution of the spanish lady but the most abandon would have think it an easy task to inspire with passion the marble statue of st francis than the cold and rigid heart of the immaculate ambrosio on hi part the friar be little acquainted with the depravity of the world he suspect not that but few of hi penitent would have reject hi address yet have he be well instruct on this head the danger attend such an attempt would have seal up hi lip in silence he know that it would be difficult for a woman to keep a secret so strange and so important a hi frailty and he even tremble l matilda should betray him anxious to preserve a reputation which be infinitely dear to him he saw all the risque of commit it to the power of some vain giddy female and a the beauty of madrid affect only hi sens without touch hi heart he forget them as soon a they be out of hi sight the danger of

antonia she think the world be compose only of those who resemble her and that vice exist be to her still a secret the monk have be of service to her he say that he wish her well she be grateful for hi kindness and think that no term be strong enough to be the vehicle of her thanks with what delight do ambrosio listen to the declaration of her artless gratitude the natural grace of her manner the unequalled sweetness of her voice her modest vivacity her unstudied elegance her expressive countenance and intelligent eye unite to inspire him with pleasure and admiration while the solidity and correctness of her remark receive additional beauty from the unaffected simplicity of the language in which they be convey ambrosio be at length oblige to tear himself from this conversation which possess for him but too many charm he repeat to antonia hi wish that hi visit should not be make know which desire she promise to observe he then quit the house while hi enchantress hasten to her mother ignorant of the mischief which her beauty have cause she be eager to know elviras opinion of the man whom she have praise in such enthusiastic term and be delight to find it equally favourable if not even more so than her own even before he speak say elvira i be prejudice in hi favour the fervour of hi exhortation dignity of hi manner and closeness of hi reason be very far from induce me to alter my opinion hi fine and fulltoned voice strike me particularly but surely antonia i have hear it before it seem perfectly familiar to my ear either i must have know the abbot in former time or hi voice bear a wonderful resemblance to that of some other to whom i have often listen there be certain tone which touch my very heart and make me feel sensation so singular that i strive in vain to account for them my dear mother it produce the same effect upon me yet certainly neither of u ever hear hi voice till we come to madrid i suspect that what we attribute to hi voice really proceeds from hi pleasant manner which forbid our consider him a a stranger i know not why but i feel more at my ease while converse with him than i usually do with people who be unknown to me i fear not to repeat to him all my childish thought and somehow i felt confident that he would hear my folly with indulgence oh i be not deceive in him he listen to me with such an air of kindness and attention he answer me with such gentleness such condescension he do not call me an infant and treat me with contempt a our cross old confessor at the castle use to do i verily believe that if i have live in murcia a thousand year i never should have like that fat old father dominic i confess that father dominic have not the most pleasing manner in the world but he be honest friendly and wellmeaning ah my dear mother those quality be so common god grant my child that experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious i have find them but too much so but tell me antonia why be it impossible for me to have see the abbot before because since the moment when he enter the abbey he have never be on the outside of it wall he tell me just now that from hi ignorance of the street he have some difficulty to find the strada di san iago though so near the abbey all this be possible and still i may have see him before he enter the abbey in order to come out it be rather necessary that he should first go in holy virgin a you say that be very trueoh but might he not have be bear in the abbey elvira smile why not very easily stay stay now i recollect how it be he be put into the abbey quite a child the common people say that he fell from heaven and be send a a present to the capuchin by the virgin that be very kind of her and so he fell from heaven antonia he must have have a terrible tumble many do not credit this and i fancy my dear mother that i must number you among the unbeliever indeed a our landlady tell my aunt the general idea be that hi parent be poor and unable to maintain him leave him just bear at the abbey door the late superior from pure charity have him educate in the convent and he prove to be a model of virtue and piety and learning and i know not what els besides in consequence he be first receive a a brother of the order and not long ago be choose abbot however whether this account or the other be the true one at least all agree that when the monk take him under their care he could not speak therefore you could not have hear hi voice before he enter the monastery because at that time he have no voice at all upon my word antonia you argue very closely your conclusion be infallible i do not suspect you of be so able a logician ah you be mock me but so much the good it delight me to see you in spirit besides you seem tranquil and easy and i hope that you will have no more convulsion oh i be sure the abbot visit would do you good it have indeed do me good my child he have quiet my mind upon some point which agitate me and i already feel the effect of hi attention my eye grow heavy and i think i can sleep a little draw the curtain my antonia but if i should not wake before midnight do not sit up with me i charge you antonia promise to obey her and have receive her blessing draw the curtain of the bed she then seat herself in silence at her embroidery frame and beguile the hour with building castle in the air her spirit be enliven by the evident change for the good in elvira and her fancy present her with vision bright and please in these dream ambrosio make no despicable figure she think of him with joy and gratitude but for every idea which fell to the friar share at least two be unconsciously bestow upon lorenzo thus pass the time till the bell in the neighbouring steeple of the capuchin cathedral announce the hour of midnight antonia remember her mother injunction and obey them though with reluctance she undrew the curtain with caution elvira be enjoy a profound and quiet slumber her cheek glow with health return colour a smile declare that her dream be pleasant and a antonia bent over her she fancy that she hear her name pronounce she kiss her mother forehead softly and retire to her chamber there she kneel before a statue of st rosolia her patroness she recommend herself to the protection of heaven and a have be her custom from infancy conclude her devotion by chaunting the follow stanza have finish her usual devotion antonia retire to bed sleep soon steal over her sens and for several hour she enjoy that calm repose which innocence alone can know and for which many a monarch with pleasure would exchange hi crown
