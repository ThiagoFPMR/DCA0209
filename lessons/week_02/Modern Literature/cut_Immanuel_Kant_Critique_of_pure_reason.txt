that all our knowledge begin with experience there can be nodoubt for how be it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awaken into exercise otherwise than by mean of object which affect our sens and partly of themselves produce representation partly rouse our power of understand into activity to compare to connect or to separate these and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous impression into a knowledge of object which be call experience in respect of time therefore noknowledge of ours be antecedent to experience but begin with it but though all our knowledge begin with experience it by nomean follow that all arise out of experience for on the contrary it be quite possible that our empirical knowledge be a compound of that which we receive through impression and that which the faculty of cognition supply from itself sensuous impression give merely the occasion an addition which we can not distinguish from the original element give by sense till long practice have make u attentive to and skilful in separate it it be therefore a question which require close investigation and not to be answer at first sight whether there exist a knowledge altogether independent of experience and even of all sensuous impression knowledge of this kind be call a priori in contradistinction to empirical knowledge which have it source a posteriori that be in experience but the expression a priori be not a yet definite enough adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above start for in speaking of knowledge which have it source in experience we be wont to say that this or that may be know a priori because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience but from a general rule which however we have itself borrow from experience thus if a man undermine hi house we say he might know a priori that it would have fall that be he need not to have wait for the experience that it do actually fall but still a priori he could not know even this much for that body be heavy and consequently that they fall when their support be take away must have be know to him previously by mean of experience by the term knowledge a priori therefore we shall in the sequel understand not such a be independent of this or that kind of experience but such a be absolutely so of all experience oppose to this be empirical knowledge or that which be possible only a posteriori that be through experience knowledge a priori be either pure or impure pure knowledge a priori be that with which noempirical element be mix up for example the proposition every change have a cause be a proposition a priori but impure because change be a conception which can only be derive from experience the human intellect even in an unphilosophical state be in possession of certain cognition a priori the question now be a to a criterion by which we may securely distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition experience nodoubt teach u that this or that object be constitute in such and such a manner but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise now in the first place if we have a proposition which contain the idea of necessity in it very conception it be a if moreover it be not derive from any other proposition unless from one equally involve the idea of necessity it be absolutely priori secondly an empirical judgement never exhibit strict and absolute but only assume and comparative universality by induction therefore the most we can say isso far a we have hitherto observe there be noexception to this or that rule if on the other hand a judgement carry with it strict and absolute universality that be admits of nopossible exception it be not derive from experience but be valid absolutely a priori empirical universality be therefore only an arbitrary extension of validity from that which may be predicate of a proposition valid in most case to that which be assert of a proposition which hold good in all a for example in the affirmation all body be heavy when on the contrary strict universality characterize a judgement it necessarily indicate another peculiar source of knowledge namely a faculty of cognition a priori necessity and strict universality therefore be infallible test for distinguish pure from empirical knowledge and be inseparably connect with each other but a in the use of these criterion the empirical limitation be sometimes more easily detect than the contingency of the judgement or the unlimited universality which we attach to a judgement be often a more convincing proof than it necessity it may be advisable to use the criterion separately each be by itself infallible now that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgement which be necessary and in the strict sense universal consequently pure a priori it will be an easy matter to show if we desire an example from the science we need only take any proposition in mathematics if we cast our eye upon the common operation of the understand the proposition every change must have a cause will amply serve our purpose in the latter case indeed the conception of a cause so plainly involve the conception of a necessity of connection with an effect and of a strict universality of the law that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear be we to derive it like hume from a frequent association of what happen with that which precede and the habit thence originating of connect representationsthe necessity inherent in the judgement be therefore merely subjective besides without seek for such example of principle exist a priori in cognition we might easily show that such principle be the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself and consequently prove their existence a priori for whence could our experience itself acquire certainty if all the rule on which it depend be themselves empirical and consequently fortuitous noone therefore can admit the validity of the use of such rule a first principle but for the present we may content ourselves with have establish the fact that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure a priori cognition and secondly with have point out the proper test of such cognition namely universality and necessity not only in judgement however but even in conception be an a priori origin manifest for example if we take away by degree from our conception of a body all that can be refer to mere sensuous experiencecolour hardness or softness weight even impenetrabilitythe body will then vanish but the space which it occupy still remain and this it be utterly impossible to annihilate in thought again if we take away in like manner from our empirical conception of any object corporeal or incorporeal all property which mere experience have teach u to connect with it still we can not think away those through which we cogitate it a substance or adhere to substance although our conception of substance be more determined than that of an object compel therefore by that necessity with which the conception of substance force itself upon u we must confess that it have it seat in our faculty of cognition a priori philosophy stand in need of a science which shall determine the possibility principle and extent of human knowledge a priori of far more importance than all that have be above say be the consideration that certain of our cognition rise completely above the sphere of all possible experience and by mean of conception to which there exist in the whole extent of experience nocorresponding object seem to extend the range of our judgement beyond it bound and just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere where experience affords u neither instruction nor guidance lie the investigation of reason which on account of their importance we consider far preferable to and a have a far more elevated aim than all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous phenomenon so high a value do we set upon these investigation that even at the risk of error we persist in follow them out and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain u from the pursuit these unavoidable problem of mere pure reason be god freedom of will and immortality the science which with all it preliminary have for it especial object the solution of these problem be name metaphysicsa science which be at the very outset dogmatical that be it confidently take upon itself the execution of this task without any previous investigation of the ability or inability of reason for such an undertaking now the safe ground of experience be thus abandon it seem nevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with the cognition we possess without know whence they come and on the strength of principle the origin of which be undiscovered instead of thus try to build without a foundation it be rather to be expect that we should long ago have put the question how the understanding can arrive at these a priori cognition and what be the extent validity and worth which they may possess we say this be natural enough meaning by the word natural that which be consistent with a just and reasonable way of thinking but if we understand by the term that which usually happen nothing indeed could be more natural and more comprehensible than that this investigation should be leave long unattempted for one part of our pure knowledge the science of mathematics have be long firmly establish and thus lead u to form flattering expectation with regard to other though these may be of quite a different nature besides when we get beyond the bound of experience we be of course safe from opposition in that quarter and the charm of widen the range of our knowledge be so great that unless we be bring to a standstill by some evident contradiction we hurry on undoubtingly in our course this however may be avoid if we be sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fiction which be not the less fiction on that account mathematical science affords u a brilliant example how far independently of all experience we may carry our a priori knowledge it be true that the mathematician occupies himself with object and cognition only in so far a they can be represent by mean of intuition but this circumstance be easily overlook because the say intuition can itself be give a priori and therefore be hardly to be distinguish from a mere pure conception deceive by such a proof of the power of reason we can perceive nolimit to the extension of our knowledge the light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air whose resistance it feel might imagine that her movement would be far more free and rapid in airless space just in the same way do plato abandon the world of sense because of the narrow limit it set to the understanding venture upon the wing of idea beyond it into the void space of pure intellect he do not reflect that he make noreal progress by all hi effort for he meet with noresistance which might serve him for a support a it be whereon to rest and on which he might apply hi power in order to let the intellect acquire momentum for it progress it be indeed the common fate of human reason in speculation to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly a possible and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the foundation be a solid one or noarrived at this point all sort of excuse be seek after in order to console u for it want of stability or rather indeed to enable u to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous an investigation but what free u during the process of building from all apprehension or suspicion and flatters u into the belief of it solidity be this a great part perhaps the great part of the business of our reason consist in the analysation of the conception which we already posse of object by this mean we gain a multitude of cognition which although really nothing more than elucidation or explanation of that which though in a confused manner be already think in our conception be at least in respect of their form prize a new introspection whilst so far a regard their matter or content we have really make noaddition to our conception but only disinvolve them but a this process do furnish a real priori knowledge which have a sure progress and useful result reason deceive by this slip in without be itself aware of it assertion of a quite different kind in which to give conception it add other a priori indeed but entirely foreign to them without our know how it arrive at these and indeed without such a question ever suggest itself i shall therefore at once proceed to examine the difference between these two mode of knowledge of the difference between analytical and synthetical judgement in all judgement wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate be cogitate i mention affirmative judgement only here the application to negative will be very easy this relation be possible in two different way either the predicate b belong to the subject a a somewhat which be contain though covertly in the conception a or the predicate b lie completely out of the conception a although it stand in connection with it in the first instance i term the judgement analytical in the second synthetical analytical judgement affirmative be therefore those in which the connection of the predicate with the subject be cogitate through identity those in which this connection be cogitate without identity be call synthetical judgement the former may be call explicative the latter augmentative judgement because the former add in the predicate nothing to the conception of the subject but only analyse it into it constituent conception which be think already in the subject although in a confused manner the latter add to our conception of the subject a predicate which be not contain in it and which noanalysis could ever have discover therein for example when i say all body be extend this be an analytical judgement for i need not go beyond the conception of body in order to find extension connect with it but merely analyse the conception that be become conscious of the manifold property which i think in that conception in order to discover this predicate in it it be therefore an analytical judgement on the other hand when i say all body be heavy the predicate be something totally different from that which i think in the mere conception of a body by the addition of such a predicate therefore it become a synthetical judgement judgement of experience a such be always synthetical for it would be absurd to think of ground an analytical judgement on experience because in form such a judgement i need not go out of the sphere of my conception and therefore recourse to the testimony of experience be quite unnecessary that body be extend be not an empirical judgement but a proposition which stand firm a priori for before address myself to experience i already have in my conception all the requisite condition for the judgement and i have only to extract the predicate from the conception accord to the principle of contradiction and thereby at the same time become conscious of the necessity of the judgement a necessity which i could never learn from experience on the other hand though at first i do not at all include the predicate of weight in my conception of body in general that conception still indicate an object of experience a part of the totality of experience to which i can still add other part and this i do when i recognize by observation that body be heavy i can cognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through the characteristic of extension impenetrability shape etc all which be cogitate in this conception but now i extend my knowledge and look back on experience from which i have derive this conception of body i find weight at all time connect with the above characteristic and therefore i synthetically add to my conception this a a predicate and say all body be heavy thus it be experience upon which rest the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of weight with the conception of body because both conception although the one be not contain in the other still belong to one another only contingently however a part of a whole namely of experience which be itself a synthesis of intuition but to synthetical judgement a priori such aid be entirely want if i go out of and beyond the conception a in order to recognize another b a connect with it what foundation have i to rest on whereby to render the synthesis possible i have here nolong the advantage of look out in the sphere of experience for what i want let u take for example the proposition everything that happen have a cause in the conception of something that happen i indeed think an existence which a certain time antecedes and from this i can derive analytical judgement but the conception of a cause lie quite out of the above conception and indicate something entirely different from that which happen and be consequently not contain in that conception how then be i able to assert concern the general conceptionthat which happenssomething entirely different from that conception and to recognize the conception of cause although not contain in it yet a belonging to it and even necessarily what be here the unknown = x upon which the understanding rest when it believe it have find out of the conception a a foreign predicate b which it nevertheless considers to be connect with it it can not be experience because the principle adduce annex the two representation cause and effect to the representation existence not only with universality which experience can not give but also with the expression of necessity therefore completely a priori and from pure conception upon such synthetical that be augmentative proposition depend the whole aim of our speculative knowledge a priori for although analytical judgement be indeed highly important and necessary they be so only to arrive at that clearness of conception which be requisite for a sure and extended synthesis and this alone be a real acquisition in all theoretical science of reason synthetical judgement a priori be contain a principle mathematical judgement be always synthetical hitherto this fact though incontestably true and very important in it consequence seem to have escape the analyst of the human mind nay to be in complete opposition to all their conjecture for a it be find that mathematical conclusion all proceed accord to the principle of contradiction which the nature of every apodeictic certainty require people become persuaded that the fundamental principle of the science also be recognize and admit in the same way but the notion be fallacious for although a synthetical proposition can certainly be discern by mean of the principle of contradiction this be possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes from which the latter be deduce but never of itself before all be it observe that proper mathematical proposition be always judgement a priori and not empirical because they carry along with them the conception of necessity which can not be give by experience if this be demur to it matter not i will then limit my assertion to pure mathematics the very conception of which imply that it consist of knowledge altogether nonempirical and a priori we might indeed at first suppose that the proposition + = be a merely analytical proposition follow accord to the principle of contradiction from the conception of a sum of seven and five but if we regard it more narrowly we find that our conception of the sum of seven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sum into one whereby it can not at all be cogitate what this single number be which embrace both the conception of twelve be by nomean obtain by merely cogitate the union of seven and five and we may analyse our conception of such a possible sum as long a we will still we shall never discover in it the notion of twelve we must go beyond these conception and have recourse to an intuition which correspond to one of the twoour five finger for example or like segner in hi arithmetic five point and so by degree add the unit contain in the five give in the intuition to the conception of seven for i first take the number and for the conception of call in the aid of the finger of my hand a object of intuition i add the unit which i before take together to make up the number gradually now by mean of the material image my hand to the number and by this process i at length see the number arise that should be add to i have certainly cogitate in my conception of a sum = + but not that this sum be equal to arithmetical proposition be therefore always synthetical of which we may become more clearly convince by try large number for it will thus become quite evident that turn and twist our conception a we may it be impossible without have recourse to intuition to arrive at the sum total or product by mean of the mere analysis of our conception just a little be any principle of pure geometry analytical a straight line between two point be the shortest be a synthetical proposition for my conception of straight contains nonotion of quantity but be merely qualitative the conception of the shortest be therefore fore wholly an addition and by noanalysis can it be extract from our conception of a straight line intuition must therefore here lend it aid by mean of which and thus only our synthesis be possible some few principle preposited by geometrician be indeed really analytical and depend on the principle of contradiction they serve however like identical proposition a link in the chain of method not a principlesfor example a = a the whole be equal to itself or a+b a the whole be great than it part and yet even these principle themselves though they derive their validity from pure conception be only admit in mathematics because they can be present in intuition what cause u here commonly to believe that the predicate of such apodeictic judgement be already contain in our conception and that the judgement be therefore analytical be merely the equivocal nature of the expression we must join in thought a certain predicate to a give conception and this necessity cleave already to the conception but the question be not what we must join in thought to the give conception but what we really think therein though only obscurely and then it become manifest that the predicate pertain to these conception necessarily indeed yet not a think in the conception itself but by virtue of an intuition which must be add to the conception the science of natural philosophy physic contains in itself synthetical judgement a priori a principle i shall adduce two proposition for instance the proposition in all change of the material world the quantity of matter remain unchanged or that in all communication of motion action and reaction must always be equal in both of these not only be the necessity and therefore their origin a priori clear but also that they be synthetical proposition for in the conception of matter i do not cogitate it permanency but merely it presence in space which it fill i therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter in order to think on to it something a priori which i do not think in it the proposition be therefore not analytical but synthetical and nevertheless conceive a priori and so it be with regard to the other proposition of the pure part of natural philosophy a to metaphysics even if we look upon it merely a an attempted science yet from the nature of human reason an indispensable one we find that it must contain synthetical proposition a priori it be not merely the duty of metaphysics to dissect and thereby analytically to illustrate the conception which we form a priori of thing but we seek to widen the range of our a priori knowledge for this purpose we must avail ourselves of such principle a add something to the original conceptionsomething not identical with nor contain in it and by mean of synthetical judgement a priori leave far behind u the limit of experience for example in the proposition the world must have a beginning and such like thus metaphysics accord to the proper aim of the science consist merely of synthetical proposition a priori the universal problem of pure reason it be extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigation under the formula of a single problem for in this manner we not only facilitate our own labour inasmuch a we define it clearly to ourselves but also render it more easy for other to decide whether we have do justice to our undertake the proper problem of pure reason then be contain in the question how be synthetical judgement a priori possible that metaphysical science have hitherto remain in so vacillate a state of uncertainty and contradiction be only to be attribute to the fact that this great problem and perhaps even the difference between analytical and synthetical judgement do not sooner suggest itself to philosopher upon the solution of this problem or upon sufficient proof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge a priori depend the existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics among philosopher david hume come the near of all to this problem yet it never acquire in hi mind sufficient precision nor do he regard the question in it universality on the contrary he stop short at the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with it cause principium causalitatis insist that such proposition a priori be impossible accord to hi conclusion then all that we term metaphysical science be a mere delusion arise from the fancied insight of reason into that which be in truth borrow from experience and to which habit have give the appearance of necessity against this assertion destructive to all pure philosophy he would have be guard have he have our problem before hi eye in it universality for he would then have perceive that accord to hi own argument there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science which assuredly can not exist without synthetical proposition a priorian absurdity from which hi good understanding must have save him in the solution of the above problem be at the same time comprehend the possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation and construction of all science which contain theoretical knowledge a priori of object that be to say the answer to the following question how be pure mathematical science possible how be pure natural science possible respect these science a they do certainly exist it may with propriety be ask how they be possiblefor that they must be possible be show by the fact of their really exist but a to metaphysics the miserable progress it have hitherto make and the fact that of noone system yet bring forward far a regard it true aim can it be say that this science really exist leave any one at liberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of it existence footnote a to the existence of pure natural science or physic perhaps many may still express doubt but we have only to look at the different proposition which be commonly treat of at the commencement of proper empirical physical sciencethose for example relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter the vi inertia the equality of action and reaction etcto be soon convince that they form a science of pure physic physica pura or rationalis which well deserve to be separately expose a a special science in it whole extent whether that be great or confine yet in a certain sense this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be look upon a give in other word metaphysics must be consider a really exist if not a a science nevertheless a a natural disposition of the human mind metaphysica naturalis for human reason without any instigation imputable to the mere vanity of great knowledge unceasingly progress urge on by it own feeling of need towards such question a can not be answer by any empirical application of reason or principle derive therefrom and so there have ever really exist in every man some system of metaphysics it will always exist so soon a reason awakes to the exercise of it power of speculation and now the question arise how be metaphysics a a natural disposition possible in other word how from the nature of universal human reason do those question arise which pure reason proposes to itself and which it be impel by it own feeling of need to answer as well a it can but a in all the attempt hitherto make to answer the question which reason be prompt by it very nature to propose to itself for example whether the world have a beginning or have exist from eternity it have always meet with unavoidable contradiction we must not rest satisfy with the mere natural disposition of the mind to metaphysics that be with the existence of the faculty of pure reason whence indeed some sort of metaphysical system always arise but it must be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the question whether we know or do not know the thing of which metaphysics treat we must be able to arrive at a decision on the subject of it question or on the ability or inability of reason to form any judgement respect them and therefore either to extend with confidence the bound of our pure reason or to set strictly define and safe limit to it action this last question which arise out of the above universal problem would properly run thus how be metaphysics possible a a science thus the critique of reason lead at last naturally and necessarily to science and on the other hand the dogmatical use of reason without criticism lead to groundless assertion against which other equally specious can always be set thus end unavoidably in scepticism besides this science can not be of great and formidable prolixity because it have not to do with object of reason the variety of which be inexhaustible but merely with reason herself and her problem problem which arise out of her own bosom and be not propose to her by the nature of outward thing but by her own nature and when once reason have previously become able completely to understand her own power in regard to object which she meet with in experience it will be easy to determine securely the extent and limit of her attempted application to object beyond the confines of experience we may and must therefore regard the attempt hitherto make to establish metaphysical science dogmatically a nonexistent for what of analysis that be mere dissection of conception be contain in one or other be not the aim of but only a preparation for metaphysics proper which have for it object the extension by mean of synthesis of our a priori knowledge and for this purpose mere analysis be of course useless because it only show what be contain in these conception but not how we arrive a priori at them and this it be her duty to show in order to be able afterwards to determine their valid use in regard to all object of experience to all knowledge in general but little selfdenial indeed be need to give up these pretension see the undeniable and in the dogmatic mode of procedure inevitable contradiction of reason with herself have long since ruin the reputation of every system of metaphysics that have appear up to this time it will require more firmness to remain undeterred by difficulty from within and opposition from without from endeavour by a method quite oppose to all those hitherto follow to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to human reasona science from which every branch it have bear may be cut away but whose root remain indestructible vii idea and division of a particular science under the name of a critique of pure reason from all that have be say there result the idea of a particular science which may be call the critique of pure reason for reason be the faculty which furnish u with the principle of knowledge a priori hence pure reason be the faculty which contain the principle of cognize anything absolutely a priori an organon of pure reason would be a compendium of those principle accord to which alone all pure cognition a priori can be obtain the completely extended application of such an organon would afford u a system of pure reason a this however be demand a great deal and it be yet doubtful whether any extension of our knowledge be here possible or if so in what case we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure reason it source and limit a the propaedeutic to a system of pure reason such a science must not be call a doctrine but only a critique of pure reason and it use in regard to speculation would be only negative not to enlarge the bound of but to purify our reason and to shield it against errorwhich alone be nolittle gain i apply the term transcendental to all knowledge which be not so much occupy with object a with the mode of our cognition of these object so far a this mode of cognition be possible a priori a system of such conception would be call transcendental philosophy but this again be still beyond the bound of our present essay for a such a science must contain a complete exposition not only of our synthetical a priori but of our analytical a priori knowledge it be of too wide a range for our present purpose because we do not require to carry our analysis any farther than be necessary to understand in their full extent the principle of synthesis a priori with which alone we have to do this investigation which we can not properly call a doctrine but only a transcendental critique because it aim not at the enlargement but at the correction and guidance of our knowledge and be to serve a a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of all knowledge a priori be the sole object of our present essay such a critique be consequently as far a possible a preparation for an organon and if this new organon should be find to fail at least for a canon of pure reason accord to which the complete system of the philosophy of pure reason whether it extend or limit the bound of that reason might one day be set forth both analytically and synthetically for that this be possible nay that such a system be not of so great extent a to preclude the hope of it ever be complete be evident for we have not here to do with the nature of outward object which be infinite but solely with the mind which judge of the nature of object and again with the mind only in respect of it cognition a priori and the object of our investigation a it be not to be seek without but altogether within ourselves can not remain concealed and in all probability be limit enough to be completely survey and fairly estimate accord to it worth or worthlessness still less let the reader here expect a critique of book s and system of pure reason our present object be exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself only when we make this critique our foundation do we possess a pure touchstone for estimate the philosophical value of ancient and modern writing on this subject and without this criterion the incompetent historian or judge decides upon and correct the groundless assertion of other with hi own which have themselves just as little foundation transcendental philosophy be the idea of a science for which the critique of pure reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically that be from principle with a full guarantee for the validity and stability of all the part which enter into the building it be the system of all the principle of pure reason if this critique itself do not assume the title of transcendental philosophy it be only because to be a complete system it ought to contain a full analysis of all human knowledge a priori our critique must indeed lay before u a complete enumeration of all the radical conception which constitute the say pure knowledge but from the complete analysis of these conception themselves a also from a complete investigation of those derive from them it abstain with reason partly because it would be deviate from the end in view to occupy itself with this analysis since this process be not attend with the difficulty and insecurity to be find in the synthesis to which our critique be entirely devote and partly because it would be inconsistent with the unity of our plan to burden this essay with the vindication of the completeness of such an analysis and deduction with which after all we have at present nothing to do this completeness of the analysis of these radical conception as well a of the deduction from the conception a priori which may be give by the analysis we can however easily attain provide only that we be in possession of all these radical conception which be to serve a principle of the synthesis and that in respect of this main purpose nothing be want to the critique of pure reason therefore belongs all that constitute transcendental philosophy and it be the complete idea of transcendental philosophy but still not the science itself because it only proceed so far with the analysis a be necessary to the power of judge completely of our synthetical knowledge a priori the principal thing we must attend to in the division of the part of a science like this be that noconception must enter it which contain aught empirical in other word that the knowledge a priori must be completely pure hence although the high principle and fundamental conception of morality be certainly cognition a priori yet they do not belong to transcendental philosophy because though they certainly do not lay the conception of pain pleasure desire inclination etc which be all of empirical origin at the foundation of it precept yet still into the conception of dutyas an obstacle to be overcome or a an incitement which should not be make into a motivethese empirical conception must necessarily enter in the construction of a system of pure morality transcendental philosophy be consequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason for all that be practical so far a it contain motif relate to feeling and these belong to empirical source of cognition if we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a science in general it ought to comprehend first a doctrine of the element and secondly a doctrine of the method of pure reason each of these main division will have it subdivision the separate reason for which we can not here particularize only so much seem necessary by way of introduction of premonition that there be two source of human knowledge which probably spring from a common but to u unknown root namely sense and understanding by the former object be give to u by the latter thought so far a the faculty of sense may contain representation a priori which form the condition under which object be give in so far it belong to transcendental philosophy the transcendental doctrine of sense must form the first part of our science of element because the condition under which alone the object of human knowledge be give must precede those under which they be think i transcendental doctrine of element first part transcendental aesthetic s i introductory in whatsoever mode or by whatsoever mean our knowledge may relate to object it be at least quite clear that the only manner in which it immediately relate to them be by mean of an intuition to this a the indispensable groundwork all think point but an intuition can take place only in so far a the object be give to u this again be only possible to man at least on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner the capacity for receive representation receptivity through the mode in which we be affect by object object be call sensibility by mean of sensibility therefore object be give to u and it alone furnish u with intuition by the understanding they be think and from it arise conception but an thought must directly or indirectly by mean of certain sign relate ultimately to intuition consequently with u to sensibility because in noother way can an object be give to u the effect of an object upon the faculty of representation so far a we be affect by the say object be sensation that sort of intuition which relate to an object by mean of sensation be call an empirical intuition the undetermined object of an empirical intuition be call phenomenon that which in the phenomenon correspond to the sensation i term it matter but that which effect that the content of the phenomenon can be arrange under certain relation i call it form but that in which our sensation be merely arrange and by which they be susceptible of assume a certain form can not be itself sensation it be then the matter of all phenomenon that be give to u a posteriori the form must lie ready a priori for them in the mind and consequently can be regard separately from all sensation i call all representation pure in the transcendental meaning of the word wherein nothing be meet with that belong to sensation and accordingly we find exist in the mind a priori the pure form of sensuous intuition in general in which all the manifold content of the phenomenal world be arrange and view under certain relation this pure form of sensibility i shall call pure intuition thus if i take away from our representation of a body all that the understanding think a belonging to it a substance force divisibility etc and also whatever belongs to sensation a impenetrability hardness colour etc yet there be still something leave u from this empirical intuition namely extension and shape these belong to pure intuition which exist a priori in the mind a a mere form of sensibility and without any real object of the sens or any sensation the science of all the principle of sensibility a priori i call transcendental aesthetic there must then be such a science form the first part of the transcendental doctrine of element in contradistinction to that part which contain the principle of pure thought and which be call transcendental logic footnote the german be the only people who at present use this word to indicate what other call the critique of taste at the foundation of this term lie the disappointed hope which the eminent analyst baumgarten conceive of subject the criticism of the beautiful to principle of reason and so of elevate it rule into a science but hi endeavour be vain for the say rule or criterion be in respect to their chief source merely empirical consequently never can serve a determinate law a priori by which our judgement in matter of taste be to be direct it be rather our judgement which form the proper test a to the correctness of the principle on this account it be advisable to give up the use of the term a designate the critique of taste and to apply it solely to that doctrine which be true sciencethe science of the law of sensibilityand thus come nearer to the language and the sense of the ancient in their wellknown division of the object of cognition into aiotheta kai noeta or to share it with speculative philosophy and employ it partly in a transcendental partly in a psychological signification in the science of transcendental aesthetic accordingly we shall first isolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty by separate from it all that be annex to it perception by the conception of understand so that nothing be leave but empirical intuition in the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belong to sensation so that nothing may remain but pure intuition and the mere form of phenomenon which be all that the sensibility can afford a priori from this investigation it will be find that there be two pure form of sensuous intuition a principle of knowledge a priori namely space and time to the consideration of these we shall now proceed section i of space metaphysical exposition of this conception by mean of the external sense a property of the mind we represent to ourselves object a without u and these all in space herein alone be their shape dimension and relation to each other determine or determinable the internal sense by mean of which the mind contemplate itself or it internal state give indeed nointuition of the soul a an object yet there be nevertheless a determinate form under which alone the contemplation of our internal state be possible so that all which relate to the inward determination of the mind be represent in relation of time of time we can not have any external intuition any more than we can have an internal intuition of space what then be time and space are they real existence or be they merely relation or determination of thing such however as would equally belong to these thing in themselves though they should never become object of intuition or be they such a belong only to the form of intuition and consequently to the subjective constitution of the mind without which these predicate of time and space could not be attach to any object in order to become informed on these point we shall first give an exposition of the conception of space by exposition i mean the clear though not detailed representation of that which belong to a conception and an exposition be metaphysical when it contain that which represent the conception a give a priori space be not a conception which have be derive from outward experience for in order that certain sensation may relate to something without me that be to something which occupy a different part of space from that in which i be in like manner in order that i may represent them not merely a without of and near to each other but also in separate place the representation of space must already exist a a foundation consequently the representation of space can not be borrow from the relation of external phenomenon through experience but on the contrary this external experience be itself only possible through the say antecedent representation space then be a necessary representation a priori which serve for the foundation of all external intuition we never can imagine or make a representation to ourselves of the nonexistence of space though we may easily enough think that noobject be find in it it must therefore be consider a the condition of the possibility of phenomenon and by nomean a a determination dependent on them and be a representation a priori which necessarily supply the basis for external phenomena space be nodiscursive or a we say general conception of the relation of thing but a pure intuition for in the first place we can only represent to ourselves one space and when we talk of diver space we mean only part of one and the same space moreover these part can not antecede this one allembracing space a the component part from which the aggregate can be make up but can be cogitate only a exist in it space be essentially one and multiplicity in it consequently the general notion of space of this or that space depend solely upon limitation hence it follow that an a priori intuition which be not empirical lie at the root of all our conception of space thus moreover the principle of geometryfor example that in a triangle two side together be great than the third be never deduce from general conception of line and triangle but from intuition and this a priori with apodeictic certainty space be represent a an infinite give quantity now every conception must indeed be consider a a representation which be contain in an infinite multitude of different possible representation which therefore comprise these under itself but noconception a such can be so conceive a if it contain within itself an infinite multitude of representation nevertheless space be so conceived of for all part of space be equally capable of be produce to infinity consequently the original representation of space be an intuition a priori and not a conception transcendental exposition of the conception of space by a transcendental exposition i mean the explanation of a conception a a principle whence can be discern the possibility of other synthetical a priori cognition for this purpose it be requisite firstly that such cognition do really flow from the give conception and secondly that the say cognition be only possible under the presupposition of a give mode of explain this conception geometry be a science which determine the property of space synthetically and yet a priori what then must be our representation of space in order that such a cognition of it may be possible it must be originally intuition for from a mere conception noproposition can be deduce which go out beyond the conception and yet this happen in geometry introd v but this intuition must be find in the mind a priori that be before any perception of object consequently must be pure not empirical intuition for geometrical principle be always apodeictic that be unite with the consciousness of their necessity a space have only three dimension but proposition of this kind can not be empirical judgement nor conclusion from them introd ii now how can an external intuition anterior to object themselves and in which our conception of object can be determine a priori exist in the human mind obviously not otherwise than in so far a it have it seat in the subject only a the formal capacity of the subject be affect by object and thereby of obtain immediate representation that be intuition consequently only a the form of the external sense in general thus it be only by mean of our explanation that the possibility of geometry a a synthetical science a priori becomes comprehensible every mode of explanation which do not show u this possibility although in appearance it may be similar to ours can with the utmost certainty be distinguish from it by these mark conclusion from the foregoing conception space do not represent any property of object a thing in themselves nor do it represent them in their relation to each other in other word space do not represent to u any determination of object such a attache to the object themselves and would remain even though all subjective condition of the intuition be abstract for neither absolute nor relative determination of object can be intuit prior to the existence of the thing to which they belong and therefore not a priori space be nothing els than the form of all phenomenon of the external sense that be the subjective condition of the sensibility under which alone external intuition be possible now because the receptivity or capacity of the subject to be affect by object necessarily antecedes all intuition of these object it be easily understood how the form of all phenomenon can be give in the mind previous to all actual perception therefore a priori and how it a a pure intuition in which all object must be determine can contain principle of the relation of these object prior to all experience it be therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of space extend object etc if we depart from the subjective condition under which alone we can obtain external intuition or in other word by mean of which we be affect by object the representation of space have nomeaning whatsoever this predicate be only applicable to thing in so far a they appear to u that be be object of sensibility the constant form of this receptivity which we call sensibility be a necessary condition of all relation in which object can be intuit a exist without u and when abstraction of these object be make be a pure intuition to which we give the name of space it be clear that we can not make the special condition of sensibility into condition of the possibility of thing but only of the possibility of their existence as far a they be phenomena and so we may correctly say that space contain all which can appear to u externally but not all thing consider a thing in themselves be they intuit or not or by whatsoever subject one will a to the intuition of other think being we can not judge whether they be or be not bind by the same condition which limit our own intuition and which for u be universally valid if we join the limitation of a judgement to the conception of the subject then the judgement will possess unconditioned validity for example the proposition all object be beside each other in space be valid only under the limitation that these thing be take a object of our sensuous intuition but if i join the condition to the conception and say all thing a external phenomenon be beside each other in space then the rule be valid universally and without any limitation our exposition consequently teach the reality ie the objective validity of space in regard of all which can be present to u externally a object and at the same time also the ideality of space in regard to object when they be consider by mean of reason a thing in themselves that be without reference to the constitution of our sensibility we maintain therefore the empirical reality of space in regard to all possible external experience although we must admit it transcendental ideality in other word that it be nothing so soon a we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all experience depend and look upon space a something that belong to thing in themselves but with the exception of space there be norepresentation subjective and refer to something external to u which could be call objective a priori for there be noother subjective representation from which we can deduce synthetical proposition a priori a we can from the intuition of space see therefore to speak accurately noideality whatever belongs to these although they agree in this respect with the representation of space that they belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous perception such a mode for example a that of sight of hear and of feeling by mean of the sensation of colour sound and heat but which because they be only sensation and not intuition do not of themselves give u the cognition of any object least of all an a priori cognition my purpose in the above remark be merely this to guard any one against illustrate the asserted ideality of space by example quite insufficient for example by colour taste etc for these must be contemplate not a property of thing but only a change in the subject change which may be different in different men for in such a case that which be originally a mere phenomenon a rise for example be take by the empirical understanding for a thing in itself though to every different eye in respect of it colour it may appear different on the contrary the transcendental conception of phenomenon in space be a critical admonition that in general nothing which be intuit in space be a thing in itself and that space be not a form which belong a a property to thing but that object be quite unknown to u in themselves and what we call outward object be nothing els but mere representation of our sensibility whose form be space but whose real correlate the thing in itself be not know by mean of these representation nor ever can be but respect which in experience noinquiry be ever make section ii of time metaphysical exposition of this conception time be not an empirical conception for neither coexistence nor succession would be perceive by u if the representation of time do not exist a a foundation a priori without this presupposition we could not represent to ourselves that thing exist together at one and the same time or at different time that be contemporaneously or in succession time be a necessary representation lie at the foundation of all our intuition with regard to phenomena in general we can not think away time from them and represent them to ourselves a out of and unconnected with time but we can quite well represent to ourselves time void of phenomena time be therefore give a priori in it alone be all reality of phenomenon possible these may all be annihilate in thought but time itself a the universal condition of their possibility can not be so annul on this necessity a priori be also found the possibility of apodeictic principle of the relation of time or axiom of time in general such a time have only one dimension different time be not coexistent but successive a different space be not successive but coexistent these principle can not be derive from experience for it would give neither strict universality nor apodeictic certainty we should only be able to say so common experience teach u but not it must be so they be valid a rule through which in general experience be possible and they instruct u respect experience and not by mean of it time be not a discursive or a it be call general conception but a pure form of the sensuous intuition different time be merely part of one and the same time but the representation which can only be give by a single object be an intuition besides the proposition that different time can not be coexistent could not be derive from a general conception for this proposition be synthetical and therefore can not spring out of conception alone it be therefore contain immediately in the intuition and representation of time the infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every determined quantity of time be possible only through limitation of one time lie at the foundation consequently the original representation time must be give a unlimited but a the determinate representation of the part of time and of every quantity of an object can only be obtain by limitation the complete representation of time must not be furnish by mean of conception for these contain only partial representation conception on the contrary must have immediate intuition for their basis transcendental exposition of the conception of time i may here refer to what be say above s where for or sake of brevity i have place under the head of metaphysical exposition that which be properly transcendental here i shall add that the conception of change and with it the conception of motion a change of place be possible only through and in the representation of time that if this representation be not an intuition internal a priori noconception of whatever kind could render comprehensible the possibility of change in other word of a conjunction of contradictorily oppose predicate in one and the same object for example the presence of a thing in a place and the nonpresence of the same thing in the same place it be only in time that it be possible to meet with two contradictorily oppose determination in one thing that be after each other thus our conception of time explain the possibility of so much synthetical knowledge a priori a be exhibit in the general doctrine of motion which be not a little fruitful conclusion from the above conception time be not something which subsist of itself or which inhere in thing a an objective determination and therefore remains when abstraction be make of the subjective condition of the intuition of thing for in the former case it would be something real yet without present to any power of perception any real object in the latter case a an order or determination inherent in thing themselves it could not be antecedent to thing a their condition nor discern or intuit by mean of synthetical proposition a priori but all this be quite possible when we regard time a merely the subjective condition under which all our intuition take place for in that case this form of the inward intuition can be represent prior to the object and consequently a priori time be nothing els than the form of the internal sense that be of the intuition of self and of our internal state for time can not be any determination of outward phenomenon it have to do neither with shape nor position on the contrary it determine the relation of representation in our internal state and precisely because this internal intuition present to u noshape or form we endeavour to supply this want by analogy and represent the course of time by a line progress to infinity the content of which constitute a series which be only of one dimension and we conclude from the property of this line a to all the property of time with this single exception that the part of the line be coexistent whilst those of time be successive from this it be clear also that the representation of time be itself an intuition because all it relation can be express in an external intuition time be the formal condition a priori of all phenomenon whatsoever space a the pure form of external intuition be limit a a condition a priori to external phenomenon alone on the other hand because all representation whether they have or have not external thing for their object still in themselves a determination of the mind belong to our internal state and because this internal state be subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition that be to timetime be a condition a priori of all phenomenon whatsoeverthe immediate condition of all internal and thereby the mediate condition of all external phenomenon if i can say a priori all outward phenomenon be in space and determine a priori accord to the relation of space i can also from the principle of the internal sense affirm universally all phenomenon in general that be all object of the sens be in time and stand necessarily in relation of time if we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuition possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and present to u by our faculty of representation and consequently take object a they be in themselves then time be nothing it be only of objective validity in regard to phenomena because these be thing which we regard a object of our sens it nolonger objective we make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition in other word of that mode of representation which be peculiar to u and speak of thing in general time be therefore merely a subjective condition of our human intuition which be always sensuous that be so far a we be affect by object and in itself independently of the mind or subject be nothing nevertheless in respect of all phenomenon consequently of all thing which come within the sphere of our experience it be necessarily objective we can not say all thing be in time because in this conception of thing in general we abstract and make nomention of any sort of intuition of thing but this be the proper condition under which time belong to our representation of object if we add the condition to the conception and say all thing a phenomenon that be object of sensuous intuition be in time then the proposition have it sound objective validity and universality a priori what we have now set forth teach therefore the empirical reality of time that be it objective validity in reference to all object which can ever be present to our sens and a our intuition be always sensuous noobject ever can be present to u in experience which do not come under the condition of time on the other hand we deny to time all claim to absolute reality that be we deny that it without have regard to the form of our sensuous intuition absolutely inhere in thing a a condition or property such property a belong to object a thing in themselves never can be present to u through the medium of the sens herein consist therefore the transcendental ideality of time accord to which if we abstract the subjective condition of sensuous intuition it be nothing and can not be reckon a subsisting or inhering in object a thing in themselves independently of it relation to our intuition this ideality like that of space be not to be prove or illustrate by fallacious analogy with sensation for this reasonthat in such argument or illustration we make the presupposition that the phenomenon in which such and such predicate inhere have objective reality while in this case we can only find such an objective reality a be itself empirical that be regard the object a a mere phenomenon in reference to this subject see the remark in section i s elucidation against this theory which grant empirical reality to time but deny to it absolute and transcendental reality i have hear from intelligent men an objection so unanimously urge that i conclude that it must naturally present itself to every reader to whom these consideration be novel it run thus change be real this the continual change in our own representation demonstrate even though the existence of all external phenomenon together with their change be deny now change be only possible in time and therefore time must be something real but there be nodifficulty in answer this i grant the whole argument time nodoubt be something real that be it be the real form of our internal intuition it therefore have subjective reality in reference to our internal experience that be i have really the representation of time and of my determination therein time therefore be not to be regard a an object but a the mode of representation of myself a an object but if i could intuit myself or be intuit by another be without this condition of sensibility then those very determination which we now represent to ourselves a change would present to u a knowledge in which the representation of time and consequently of change would not appear the empirical reality of time therefore remain a the condition of all our experience but absolute reality accord to what have be say above can not be grant it time be nothing but the form of our internal intuition if we take away from it the special condition of our sensibility the conception of time also vanishes and it inhere not in the object themselves but solely in the subject or mind which intuit them footnote i can indeed say my representation follow one another or be successive but this mean only that we be conscious of them a in a succession that be accord to the form of the internal sense time therefore be not a thing in itself nor be it any objective determination pertain to or inherent in thing but the reason why this objection be so unanimously bring against our doctrine of time and that too by disputant who can not start any intelligible argument against the doctrine of the ideality of space be thisthey have nohope of demonstrate apodeictically the absolute reality of space because the doctrine of idealism be against them accord to which the reality of external object be not capable of any strict proof on the other hand the reality of the object of our internal sense that be myself and my internal state be clear immediately through consciousness the formerexternal object in spacemight be a mere delusion but the latterthe object of my internal perceptionis undeniably real they do not however reflect that both without question of their reality a representation belong only to the genus phenomenon which have always two aspects the one the object consider a a thing in itself without regard to the mode of intuit it and the nature of which remain for this very reason problematical the other the form of our intuition of the object which must be seek not in the object a a thing in itself but in the subject to which it appearswhich form of intuition nevertheless belongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object time and space be therefore two source of knowledge from which a priori various synthetical cognition can be draw of this we find a striking example in the cognition of space and it relation which form the foundation of pure mathematics they be the two pure form of all intuition and thereby make synthetical proposition a priori possible but these source of knowledge be merely condition of our sensibility do therefore and a such strictly determine their own range and purpose in that they do not and can not present object a thing in themselves but be applicable to them solely in so far a they be consider a sensuous phenomenon the sphere of phenomenon be the only sphere of their validity and if we venture out of this nofurther objective use can be make of them for the rest this formal reality of time and space leave the validity of our empirical knowledge unshaken for our certainty in that respect be equally firm whether these form necessarily inhere in the thing themselves or only in our intuition of them on the other hand those who maintain the absolute reality of time and space whether a essentially subsist or only inhere a modification in thing must find themselves at utter variance with the principle of experience itself for if they decide for the first view and make space and time into substance this be the side take by mathematical natural philosopher they must admit two selfsubsisting nonentity infinite and eternal which exist yet without there be anything real for the purpose of contain in themselves everything that be real if they adopt the second view of inherence which be prefer by some metaphysical natural philosopher and regard space and time a relation contiguity in space or succession in time abstract from experience though represent confusedly in this state of separation they find themselves in that case necessitate to deny the validity of mathematical doctrine a priori in reference to real thing for example in spaceat all event their apodeictic certainty for such certainty can not be find in an a posteriori proposition and the conception a priori of space and time be accord to this opinion mere creation of the imagination have their source really in experience inasmuch a out of relation abstract from experience imagination have make up something which contain indeed general statement of these relation yet of which noapplication can be make without the restriction attach thereto by nature the former of these party gain this advantage that they keep the sphere of phenomenon free for mathematical science on the other hand these very condition space and time embarrass them greatly when the understanding endeavour to pass the limit of that sphere the latter have indeed this advantage that the representation of space and time do not come in their way when they wish to judge of object not a phenomenon but merely in their relation to the understanding devoid however of a true and objectively valid a priori intuition they can neither furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematical cognition a priori nor bring the proposition of experience into necessary accordance with those of mathematics in our theory of the true nature of these two original form of the sensibility both difficulty be surmount in conclusion that transcendental aesthetic can not contain any more than these two elementsspace and time be sufficiently obvious from the fact that all other conception appertain to sensibility even that of motion which unite in itself both element presuppose something empirical motion for example presuppose the perception of something movable but space consider in itself contain nothing movable consequently motion must be something which be find in space only through experiencein other word an empirical datum in like manner transcendental aesthetic can not number the conception of change among it data a priori for time itself do not change but only something which be in time to acquire the conception of change therefore the perception of some exist object and of the succession of it determination in one word experience be necessary general remark on transcendental aesthetic in order to prevent any misunderstand it will be requisite in the first place to recapitulate as clearly a possible what our opinion be with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous cognition in general we have intend then to say that all our intuition be nothing but the representation of phenomenon that the thing which we intuit be not in themselves the same a our representation of them in intuition nor be their relation in themselves so constitute a they appear to u and that if we take away the subject or even only the subjective constitution of our sens in general then not only the nature and relation of object in space and time but even space and time themselves disappear and that these a phenomenon can not exist in themselves but only in u what may be the nature of object consider a thing in themselves and without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility be quite unknown to u we know nothing more than our mode of perceive them which be peculiar to u and which though not of necessity pertaining to every animate be be so to the whole human race with this alone we have to do space and time be the pure form thereof sensation the matter the former alone can we cognize a priori that be antecedent to all actual perception and for this reason such cognition be call pure intuition the latter be that in our cognition which be call cognition a posteriori that be empirical intuition the former appertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility of whatsoever kind our sensation may be the latter may be of very diversified character suppose that we should carry our empirical intuition even to the very high degree of clearness we should not thereby advance one step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of object a thing in themselves for we could only at best arrive at a complete cognition of our own mode of intuition that be of our sensibility and this always under the condition originally attach to the subject namely the condition of space and time while the question what be object consider a thing in themselves remain unanswerable even after the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world to say then that all our sensibility be nothing but the confused representation of thing contain exclusively that which belong to them a thing in themselves and this under an accumulation of characteristic mark and partial representation which we can not distinguish in consciousness be a falsification of the conception of sensibility and phenomenization which render our whole doctrine thereof empty and useless the difference between a confused and a clear representation be merely logical and have nothing to do with content nodoubt the conception of right a employ by a sound understanding contain all that the most subtle investigation could unfold from it although in the ordinary practical use of the word we be not conscious of the manifold representation comprise in the conception but we can not for this reason assert that the ordinary conception be a sensuous one contain a mere phenomenon for right can not appear a a phenomenon but the conception of it lie in the understanding and represent a property the moral property of action which belong to them in themselves on the other hand the representation in intuition of a body contain nothing which could belong to an object consider a a thing in itself but merely the phenomenon or appearance of something and the mode in which we be affect by that appearance and this receptivity of our faculty of cognition be call sensibility and remain toto caelo different from the cognition of an object in itself even though we should examine the content of the phenomenon to the very bottom it must be admit that the leibnitzwolfian philosophy have assign an entirely erroneous point of view to all investigation into the nature and origin of our cognition inasmuch a it regard the distinction between the sensuous and the intellectual a merely logical whereas it be plainly transcendental and concern not merely the clearness or obscurity but the content and origin of both for the faculty of sensibility not only do not present u with an indistinct and confused cognition of object a thing in themselves but in fact give u noknowledge of these at all on the contrary so soon a we abstract in thought our own subjective nature the object represent with the property ascribe to it by sensuous intuition entirely disappear because it be only this subjective nature that determine the form of the object a a phenomenon in phenomenon we commonly indeed distinguish that which essentially belong to the intuition of them and be valid for the sensuous faculty of every human be from that which belong to the same intuition accidentally a valid not for the sensuous faculty in general but for a particular state or organization of this or that sense accordingly we be accustom to say that the former be a cognition which represent the object itself whilst the latter present only a particular appearance or phenomenon thereof this distinction however be only empirical if we stop here as be usual and do not regard the empirical intuition a itself a mere phenomenon a we ought to do in which nothing that can appertain to a thing in itself be to be find our transcendental distinction be lose and we believe that we cognize object a thing in themselves although in the whole range of the sensuous world investigate the nature of it object as profoundly a we may we have to do with nothing but phenomena thus we call the rainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower and the rain the reality or thing in itself and this be right enough if we understand the latter conception in a merely physical sense that be a that which in universal experience and under whatever condition of sensuous perception be know in intuition to be so and so determined and not otherwise but if we consider this empirical datum generally and inquire without reference to it accordance with all our sens whether there can be discover in it aught which represent an object a a thing in itself the raindrop of course be not such for they be a phenomena empirical object the question of the relation of the representation to the object be transcendental and not only be the raindrop mere phenomenon but even their circular form nay the space itself through which they fall be nothing in itself but both be mere modification or fundamental disposition of our sensuous intuition whilst the transcendental object remain for u utterly unknown the second important concern of our aesthetic be that it do not obtain favour merely a a plausible hypothesis but posse a undoubted a character of certainty a can be demand of any theory which be to serve for an organon in order fully to convince the reader of this certainty we shall select a case which will serve to make it validity apparent and also to illustrate what have be say in suppose then that space and time be in themselves objective and condition of thepossibility of object a thing in themselves in the first place it be evident that both present u with very many apodeictic and synthetic proposition a priori but especially spaceand for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation at present a the proposition of geometry be cognize synthetically a priori and with apodeictic certainty i inquire whence do you obtain proposition of this kind and on what basis do the understanding rest in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universally valid truth there be noother way than through intuition or conception a such and these be give either a priori or a posteriori the latter namely empirical conception together with the empirical intuition on which they be found can not afford any synthetical proposition except such a be itself also empirical that be a proposition of experience but an empirical proposition can not possess the quality of necessity and absolute universality which nevertheless be the characteristic of all geometrical proposition a to the first and only mean to arrive at such cognition namely through mere conception or intuition a priori it be quite clear that from mere conception nosynthetical cognition but only analytical one can be obtain take for example the proposition two straight line can not enclose a space and with these alone nofigure be possible and try to deduce it from the conception of a straight line and the number two or take the proposition it be possible to construct a figure with three straight line and endeavour in like manner to deduce it from the mere conception of a straight line and the number three all your endeavour be in vain and you find yourself force to have recourse to intuition a in fact geometry always do you therefore give yourself an object in intuition but of what kind be this intuition be it a pure a priori or be it an empirical intuition if the latter then neither an universally valid much less an apodeictic proposition can arise from it for experience never can give u any such proposition you must therefore give yourself an object a priori in intuition and upon that ground your synthetical proposition now if there do not exist within you a faculty of intuition a priori if this subjective condition be not in respect to it form also the universal condition a priori under which alone the object of this external intuition be itself possible if the object that be the triangle be something in itself without relation to you the subject how could you affirm that that which lie necessarily in your subjective condition in order to construct a triangle must also necessarily belong to the triangle in itself for to your conception of three line you could not add anything new that be the figure which therefore must necessarily be find in the object because the object be give before your cognition and not by mean of it if therefore space and time also be not a mere form of your intuition which contain condition a priori under which alone thing can become external object for you and without which subjective condition the object be in themselves nothing you could not construct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regard external object it be therefore not merely possible or probable but indubitably certain that space and time a the necessary condition of all our external and internal experience be merely subjective condition of all our intuition in relation to which all object be therefore mere phenomenon and not thing in themselves present to u in this particular manner and for this reason in respect to the form of phenomenon much may be say a priori whilst of the thing in itself which may lie at the foundation of these phenomenon it be impossible to say anything ii in confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external as well a internal sense consequently of all object of sense a mere phenomenon we may especially remark that all in our cognition that belong to intuition contains nothing more than mere relation the feeling of pain and pleasure and the will which be not cognition be except the relation to wit of place in an intuition extension change of place motion and law accord to which this change be determined move force that however which be present in this or that place or any operation go on or result take place in the thing themselves with the exception of change of place be not give to u by intuition now by mean of mere relation a thing can not be know in itself and it may therefore be fairly conclude that a through the external sense nothing but mere representation of relation be give u the say external sense in it representation can contain only the relation of the object to the subject but not the essential nature of the object a a thing in itself the same be the case with the internal intuition not only because in the internal intuition the representation of the external sens constitute the material with which the mind be occupy but because time in which we place and which itself antecede the consciousness of these representation in experience and which a the formal condition of the mode accord to which object be place in the mind lie at the foundation of them contain relation of the successive the coexistent and of that which always must be coexistent with succession the permanent now that which a representation can antecede every exercise of thought of an object be intuition and when it contain nothing but relation it be the form of the intuition which a it present u with norepresentation except in so far a something be place in the mind can be nothing els than the mode in which the mind be affect by it own activity to witits present to itself representation consequently the mode in which the mind be affect by itself that be it can be nothing but an internal sense in respect to it form everything that be represent through the medium of sense be so far phenomenal consequently we must either refuse altogether to admit an internal sense or the subject which be the object of that sense could only be represent by it a phenomenon and not a it would judge of itself if it intuition be pure spontaneous activity that be be intellectual the difficulty here lie wholly in the question how can the subject have an internal intuition of itself but this difficulty be common to every theory the consciousness of self apperception be the simple representation of the ego and if by mean of that representation alone all the manifold representation in the subject be spontaneously give then our internal intuition would be intellectual this consciousness in man require an internal perception of the manifold representation which be previously give in the subject and the manner in which these representation be give in the mind without spontaneity must on account of this difference the want of spontaneity be call sensibility if the faculty of selfconsciousness be to apprehend what lie in the mind it must all act that and can in this way alone produce an intuition of self but the form of this intuition which lie in the original constitution of the mind determine in the representation of time the manner in which the manifold representation be to combine themselves in the mind since the subject intuit itself not a it would represent itself immediately and spontaneously but accord to the manner in which the mind be internally affect consequently a it appear and not a it be iii when we say that the intuition of external object and also the selfintuition of the subject represent both object and subject in space and time a they affect our sens that be a they appearthis be by nomean equivalent to assert that these object be mere illusory appearance for when we speak of thing a phenomenon the object nay even the property which we ascribe to them be looked upon a really give only that in so far a this or that property depend upon the mode of intuition of the subject in the relation of the give object to the subject the object a phenomenon be to be distinguish from the object a a thing in itself thus i do not say that body seem or appear to be external to me or that my soul seem merely to be give in my selfconsciousness although i maintain that the property of space and time in conformity to which i set both a the condition of their existence abide in my mode of intuition and not in the object in themselves it would be my own fault if out of that which i should reckon a phenomenon i make mere illusory appearance but this will not happen because of our principle of the ideality of all sensuous intuition on the contrary if we ascribe objective reality to these form of representation it become impossible to avoid change everything into mere appearance for if we regard space and time a property which must be find in object a thing in themselves a sine quibus non of the possibility of their existence and reflect on the absurdity in which we then find ourselves involved inasmuch a we be compel to admit the existence of two infinite thing which be nevertheless not substance nor anything really inhere in substance nay to admit that they be the necessary condition of the existence of all thing and moreover that they must continue to exist although all exist thing be annihilatedwe can not blame the good berkeley for degrade body to mere illusory appearance nay even our own existence which would in this case depend upon the selfexistent reality of such a mere nonentity a time would necessarily be change with it into mere appearancean absurdity which noone have as yet be guilty of footnote the predicate of the phenomenon can be affix to the object itself in relation to our sensuous faculty for example the red colour or the perfume to the rise but illusory appearance never can be attribute a a predicate to an object for this very reason that it attribute to this object in itself that which belong to it only in relation to our sensuous faculty or to the subject in general eg the two handle which be formerly ascribe to saturn that which be never to be find in the object itself but always in the relation of the object to the subject and which moreover be inseparable from our representation of the object we denominate phenomenon thus the predicate of space and time be rightly attribute to object of the sens a such and in this there be noillusion on the contrary if i ascribe redness of the rise a a thing in itself or to saturn hi handle or extension to all external object consider a thing in themselves without regard the determinate relation of these object to the subject and without limit my judgement to that relationthen and then only arise illusion iv in natural theology where we think of an objectgodwhich never can be an object of intuition to u and even to himself can never be an object of sensuous intuition we carefully avoid attribute to hi intuition the condition of space and timeand intuition all hi cognition must be and not think which always include limitation but with what right can we do this if we make them form of object a thing in themselves and such moreover a would continue to exist a a priori condition of the existence of thing even though the thing themselves be annihilate for a condition of all existence in general space and time must be condition of the existence of the supreme being also but if we do not thus make them objective form of all thing there be noother way leave than to make them subjective form of our mode of intuitionexternal and internal which be call sensuous because it be not primitive that be be not such a give in itself the existence of the object of the intuition a mode of intuition which so far a we can judge can belong only to the creator but be dependent on the existence of the object be possible therefore only on condition that the representative faculty of the subject be affect by the object it be moreover not necessary that we should limit the mode of intuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man it may well be that all finite thinking being must necessarily in this respect agree with man though as to this we can not decide but sensibility do not on account of this universality cease to be sensibility for this very reason that it be a deduced intuitus derivativus and not an original intuitus originarius consequently not an intellectual intuition and this intuition a such for reason above mention seem to belong solely to the supreme being but never to a be dependent quoad it existence as well a it intuition which it existence determines and limit relatively to give object this latter remark however must be take only a an illustration and not a any proof of the truth of our aesthetical theory conclusion of the transcendental aesthetic we have now completely before u one part of the solution of the grand general problem of transcendental philosophy namely the question how be synthetical proposition a priori possible that be to say we have show that we be in possession of pure a priori intuition namely space and time in which we find when in a judgement a priori we pass out beyond the give conception something which be not discoverable in that conception but be certainly find a priori in the intuition which correspond to the conception and can be unite synthetically with it but the judgement which these pure intuition enable u to make never reach far than to object of the sens and be valid only for object of possible experience second part transcendental logic introduction idea of a transcendental logic of logic in general our knowledge spring from two main source in the mind first of which be the faculty or power of receive representation receptivity for impression the second be the power of cognizing by mean of these representation spontaneity in the production of conception through the first an object be give to u through the second it be in relation to the representation which be a mere determination of the mind think intuition and conception constitute therefore the element of all our knowledge so that neither conception without an intuition in some way correspond to them nor intuition without conception can afford u a cognition both be either pure or empirical they be empirical when sensation which presuppose the actual presence of the object be contain in them and pure when nosensation be mixed with the representation sensation we may call the matter of sensuous cognition pure intuition consequently contain merely the form under which something be intuit and pure conception only the form of the thought of an object only pure intuition and pure conception be possible a priori the empirical only a posteriori we apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for impression in so far a it be in some way affect and on the other hand we call the faculty of spontaneously produce representation or the spontaneity of cognition understand our nature be so constituted that intuition with u never can be other than sensuous that be it contain only the mode in which we be affect by object on the other hand the faculty of think the object of sensuous intuition be the understand neither of these faculty have a preference over the other without the sensuous faculty noobject would be give to u and without the understanding noobject would be think thought without content be void intuition without conception blind hence it be a necessary for the mind to make it conception sensuous that be to join to them the object in intuition a to make it intuition intelligible that be to bring them under conception neither of these faculty can exchange it proper function understand can not intuit and the sensuous faculty can not think in noother way than from the united operation of both can knowledge arise but noone ought on this account to overlook the difference of the element contribute by each we have rather great reason carefully to separate and distinguish them we therefore distinguish the science of the law of sensibility that be aesthetic from the science of the law of the understanding that be logic now logic in it turn may be consider as twofoldnamely a logic of the general or of the particular use of the understand the first contain the absolutely necessary law of thought without which nouse whatsoever of the understanding be possible and give law therefore to the understand without regard to the difference of object on which it may be employ the logic of the particular use of the understanding contain the law of correct think upon a particular class of object the former may be call elemental logicthe latter the organon of this or that particular science the latter be for the most part employ in the school a a propaedeutic to the science although indeed accord to the course of human reason it be the last thing we arrive at when the science have be already mature and need only the finishing touch towards it correction and completion for our knowledge of the object of our attempted science must be tolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the law by which a science of these object can be establish general logic be again either pure or apply in the former we abstract all the empirical condition under which the understanding be exercise for example the influence of the sens the play of the fantasy or imagination the law of the memory the force of habit of inclination etc consequently also the source of prejudicein a word we abstract all cause from which particular cognition arise because these cause regard the understanding under certain circumstance of it application and to the knowledge of them experience be require pure general logic have to do therefore merely with pure a priori principle and be a canon of understanding and reason but only in respect of the formal part of their use be the content what it may empirical or transcendental general logic be call apply when it be direct to the law of the use of the understand under the subjective empirical condition which psychology teach u it have therefore empirical principle although at the same time it be in so far general that it apply to the exercise of the understanding without regard to the difference of object on this account moreover it be neither a canon of the understanding in general nor an organon of a particular science but merely a cathartic of the human understanding in general logic therefore that part which constitute pure logic must be carefully distinguish from that which constitute apply though still general logic the former alone be properly science although short and dry a the methodical exposition of an elemental doctrine of the understanding ought to be in this therefore logicians must always bear in mind two rule a general logic it make abstraction of all content of the cognition of the understanding and of the difference of object and have to do with nothing but the mere form of thought a pure logic it have noempirical principle and consequently draw nothing contrary to the common persuasion from psychology which therefore have noinfluence on the canon of the understand it be a demonstrated doctrine and everything in it must be certain completely a priori what i call apply logic contrary to the common acceptation of this term accord to which it should contain certain exercise for the scholar for which pure logic give the rule be a representation of the understanding and of the rule of it necessary employment in concreto that be to say under the accidental condition of the subject which may either hinder or promote this employment and which be all give only empirically thus apply logic treat of attention it impediment and consequence of the origin of error of the state of doubt hesitation conviction etc and to it be relate pure general logic in the same way that pure morality which contain only the necessary moral law of a free will be relate to practical ethic which consider these law under all the impediment of feeling inclination and passion to which men be more or less subject and which never can furnish u with a true and demonstrate science because it as well a apply logic require empirical and psychological principle ii of transcendental logic general logic a we have see make abstraction of all content of cognition that be of all relation of cognition to it object and regard only the logical form in the relation of cognition to each other that be the form of thought in general but a we have both pure and empirical intuition a transcendental aesthetic prof in like manner a distinction might be draw between pure and empirical thought of object in this case there would exist a kind of logic in which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition for or logic which should comprise merely the law of pure thought of an object would of course exclude all those cognition which be of empirical content this kind of logic would also examine the origin of our cognition of object so far a that origin can not be ascribe to the object themselves while on the contrary general logic have nothing to do with the origin of our cognition but contemplate our representation be they give primitively a priori in ourselves or be they only of empirical origin solely accord to the law which the understanding observe in employ them in the process of thought in relation to each other consequently general logic treat of the form of the understand only which can be apply to representation from whatever source they may have arise and here i shall make a remark which the reader must bear well in mind in the course of the following consideration to wit that not every cognition a priori but only those through which we cognize that and how certain representation intuition or conception be apply or be possible only a priori that be to say the a priori possibility of cognition and the a priori use of it be transcendental therefore neither be space nor any a priori geometrical determination of space a transcendental representation but only the knowledge that such a representation be not of empirical origin and the possibility of it relating to object of experience although itself a priori can be call transcendental so also the application of space to object in general would be transcendental but if it be limit to object of sense it be empirical thus the distinction of the transcendental and empirical belongs only to the critique of cognition and do not concern the relation of these to their object accordingly in the expectation that there may perhaps be conception which relate a priori to object not a pure or sensuous intuition but merely a act of pure think which be therefore conception but neither of empirical nor aesthetical originin this expectation i say we form to ourselves by anticipation the idea of a science of pure understanding and rational cognition by mean of which we may cogitate object entirely a priori a science of this kind which should determine the origin the extent and the objective validity of such cognition must be call transcendental logic because it have not like general logic to do with the law of understanding and reason in relation to empirical as well a pure rational cognition without distinction but concern itself with these only in an a priori relation to object iii of the division of general logic into analytic and dialectic the old question with which people seek to push logician into a corner so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophism or confess their ignorance and consequently the vanity of their whole art be this what be truth the definition of the word truth to wit the accordance of the cognition with it object be presuppose in the question but we desire to be tell in the answer to it what be the universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition to know what question we may reasonably propose be in itself a strong evidence of sagacity and intelligence for if a question be in itself absurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer it be attend with the dangernot to mention the shame that fall upon the person who propose itof seduce the unguarded listener into make absurd answer and we be present with the ridiculous spectacle of one a the ancient say milk the hegoat and the other hold a sieve if truth consist in the accordance of a cognition with it object this object must be ipso facto distinguish from all other for a cognition be false if it do not accord with the object to which it relate although it contain something which may be affirm of other object now an universal criterion of truth would be that which be valid for all cognition without distinction of their object but it be evident that since in the case of such a criterion we make abstraction of all the content of a cognition that be of all relation to it object and truth relates precisely to this content it must be utterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of cognition and that accordingly a sufficient and at the same time universal test of truth can not possibly be find a we have already term the content of a cognition it matter we shall say of the truth of our cognition in respect of their matter nouniversal test can be demand because such a demand be selfcontradictory on the other hand with regard to our cognition in respect of it mere form exclude all content it be equally manifest that logic in so far a it exhibit the universal and necessary law of the understanding must in these very law present u with criterion of truth whatever contradict these rule be false because thereby the understanding be make to contradict it own universal law of thought that be to contradict itself these criterion however apply solely to the form of truth that be of thought in general and in so far they be perfectly accurate yet not sufficient for although a cognition may be perfectly accurate a to logical form that be not selfcontradictory it be notwithstanding quite possible that it may not stand in agreement with it object consequently the merely logical criterion of truth namely the accordance of a cognition with the universal and formal law of understanding and reason be nothing more than the conditio sine qua non or negative condition of all truth farther than this logic can not go and the error which depend not on the form but on the content of the cognition it have notest to discover general logic then resolve the whole formal business of understanding and reason into it element and exhibit them a principle of all logical judging of our cognition this part of logic may therefore be call analytic and be at least the negative test of truth because all cognition must first of an be estimate and try accord to these law before we proceed to investigate them in respect of their content in order to discover whether they contain positive truth in regard to their object because however the mere form of a cognition accurately a it may accord with logical law be insufficient to supply u with material objective truth noone by mean of logic alone can venture to predicate anything of or decide concern object unless he have obtain independently of logic wellgrounded information about them in order afterwards to examine accord to logical law into the use and connection in a cohering whole of that information or what be still well merely to test it by them notwithstanding there lie so seductive a charm in the possession of a specious art like thisan art which give to all our cognition the form of the understanding although with respect to the content thereof we may be sadly deficientthat general logic which be merely a canon of judgement have be employ a an organon for the actual production or rather for the semblance of production of objective assertion and have thus be grossly misapply now general logic in it assumed character of organon be call dialectic different a be the signification in which the ancient use this term for a science or an art we may safely infer from their actual employment of it that with them it be nothing els than a logic of illusiona sophistical art for give ignorance nay even intentional sophistry the colouring of truth in which the thoroughness of procedure which logic require be imitate and their topic employ to cloak the empty pretension now it may be take a a safe and useful warning that general logic consider a an organon must always be a logic of illusion that be be dialectical for a it teach u nothing whatever respect the content of our cognition but merely the formal condition of their accordance with the understanding which do not relate to and be quite indifferent in respect of object any attempt to employ it a an instrument organon in order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end in mere prate any one be able to maintain or oppose with some appearance of truth any single assertion whatever such instruction be quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy for these reason we have choose to denominate this part of logic dialectic in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion and we wish the term to be so understood in this place iv of the division of transcendental logic into transcendental analytic and dialectic in transcendental logic we isolate the understanding a in transcendental aesthetic the sensibility and select from our cognition merely that part of thought which have it origin in the understanding alone the exercise of this pure cognition however depend upon this a it condition that object to which it may be apply be give to u in intuition for without intuition the whole of our cognition be without object and be therefore quite void that part of transcendental logic then which treat of the element of pure cognition of the understanding and of the principle without which noobject at all can be think be transcendental analytic and at the same time a logic of truth for nocognition can contradict it without lose at the same time all content that be lose all reference to an object and therefore all truth but because we be very easily seduce into employ these pure cognition and principle of the understanding by themselves and that even beyond the boundary of experience which yet be the only source whence we can obtain matter object on which those pure conception may be employedunderstanding run the risk of make by mean of empty sophism a material and objective use of the mere formal principle of the pure understanding and of pass judgement on object without distinctionobjects which be not give to u nay perhaps can not be give to u in any way now a it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of the empirical use of the understanding this kind of logic be misuse when we seek to employ it a an organon of the universal and unlimited exercise of the understanding and attempt with the pure understand alone to judge synthetically affirm and determine respecting object in general in this case the exercise of the pure understand becomes dialectical the second part of our transcendental logic must therefore be a critique of dialectical illusion and this critique we shall term transcendental dialecticnot mean it a an art of produce dogmatically such illusion an art which be unfortunately too current among the practitioner of metaphysical juggling but a a critique of understanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use this critique will expose the groundless nature of the pretension of these two faculty and invalidate their claim to the discovery and enlargement of our cognition merely by mean of transcendental principle and show that the proper employment of these faculty be to test the judgement make by the pure understanding and to guard it from sophistical delusion transcendental logic first division transcendental analytic s i transcendental analytic be the dissection of the whole of our a priori knowledge into the element of the pure cognition of the understanding in order to effect our purpose it be necessary that the conception be pure and not empirical that they belong not to intuition and sensibility but to think and understand that they be elementary conception and a such quite different from deduce or compound conception that our table of these elementary conception be complete and fill up the whole sphere of the pure understanding now this completeness of a science can not be accept with confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of it existence in an aggregate form only by mean of repeated experiment and attempt the completeness which we require be possible only by mean of an idea of the totality of the a priori cognition of the understanding and through the thereby determine division of the conception which form the say whole consequently only by mean of their connection in a system pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely from everything empirical but also completely from all sensibility it be a unity selfsubsistent selfsufficient and not to be enlarge by any addition from without hence the sum of it cognition constitute a system to be determine by and comprise under an idea and the completeness and articulation of this system can at the same time serve a a test of the correctness and genuineness of all the part of cognition that belong to it the whole of this part of transcendental logic consists of two book s of which the one contain the conception and the other the principle of pure understand book i analytic of conception by the term analytic of conception i do not understand the analysis of these or the usual process in philosophical investigation of dissect the conception which present themselves accord to their content and so make them clear but i mean the hitherto little attempted dissection of the faculty of understand itself in order to investigate the possibility of conception a priori by look for them in the understanding alone a their birthplace and analyse the pure use of this faculty for this be the proper duty of a transcendental philosophy what remain be the logical treatment of the conception in philosophy in general we shall therefore follow up the pure conception even to their germ and beginning in the human understanding in which they lie until they be develop on occasion present by experience and free by the same understanding from the empirical condition attach to them be set forth in their unalloyed purity chapter i of the transcendental clue to the discovery of all pure conception of the understanding introductory when we call into play a faculty of cognition different conception manifest themselves accord to the different circumstance and make know this faculty and assemble themselves into a more or less extensive collection accord to the time or penetration that have be apply to the consideration of them where this process conduct a it be mechanically so to speak will end can not be determine with certainty besides the conception which we discover in this haphazard manner present themselves by nomean in order and systematic unity but be at last coupled together only accord to resemblance to each other and arrange in series accord to the quantity of their content from the simpler to the more complexseries which be anything but systematic though not altogether without a certain kind of method in their construction transcendental philosophy have the advantage and moreover the duty of search for it conception accord to a principle because these conception spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding a an absolute unity and therefore must be connect with each other accord to one conception or idea a connection of this kind however furnish u with a ready prepared rule by which it proper place may be assign to every pure conception of the understanding and the completeness of the system of all be determine a prioriboth which would otherwise have be dependent on mere choice or chance section of define above use of understand in general the understanding be define above only negatively a a nonsensuous faculty of cognition now independently of sensibility we can not possibly have any intuition consequently the understanding be nofaculty of intuition but besides intuition there be noother mode of cognition except through conception consequently the cognition of every at least of every human understanding be a cognition through conceptionsnot intuitive but discursive all intuition a sensuous depend on affection conception therefore upon function by the word function i understand the unity of the act of arrange diverse representation under one common representation conception then be base on the spontaneity of thought a sensuous intuition be on the receptivity of impression now the understanding can not make any other use of these conception than to judge by mean of them a norepresentation except an intuition relate immediately to it object a conception never relate immediately to an object but only to some other representation thereof be that an intuition or itself a conception a judgement therefore be the mediate cognition of an object consequently the representation of a representation of it in every judgement there be a conception which apply to and be valid for many other conception and which among these comprehends also a give representation this last be immediately connect with an object for example in the judgementall body be divisible our conception of divisible applies to various other conception among these however it be here particularly apply to the conception of body and this conception of body relates to certain phenomenon which occur to u these object therefore be mediately represent by the conception of divisibility all judgement accordingly be function of unity in our representation inasmuch a instead of an immediate a high representation which comprise this and various other be use for our cognition of the object and thereby many possible cognition be collect into one but we can reduce all act of the understanding to judgement so that understanding may be represent a the faculty of judge for it be accord to what have be say above a faculty of thought now think be cognition by mean of conception but conception a predicate of possible judgement relate to some representation of a yet undetermined object thus the conception of body indicate somethingfor example metalwhich can be cognize by mean of that conception it be therefore a conception for the reason alone that other representation be contain under it by mean of which it can relate to object it be therefore the predicate to a possible judgement for example every metal be a body all the function of the understanding therefore can be discover when we can completely exhibit the function of unity in judgement and that this may be effect very easily the following section will show section ii of the logical function of the understanding in judgement if we abstract all the content of a judgement and consider only the intellectual form thereof we find that the function of thought in a judgement can be bring under four head of which each contains three momentum these may be conveniently represent in the following table quantity of judgement universal particular singular quality relation affirmative categorical negative hypothetical infinite disjunctive modality problematical assertorical apodeictical a this division appear to differ in some though not essential point from the usual technique of logician the following observation for the prevention of otherwise possible misunderstanding will not be without their use logician say with justice that in the use of judgement in syllogisms singular judgement may be treat like universal one for precisely because a singular judgement have noextent at all it predicate can not refer to a part of that which be contain in the conception of the subject and be exclude from the rest the predicate be valid for the whole conception just a if it be a general conception and have extent to the whole of which the predicate apply on the other hand let u compare a singular with a general judgement merely a a cognition in regard to quantity the singular judgement relate to the general one a unity to infinity and be therefore in itself essentially different thus if we estimate a singular judgement judicium singular not merely accord to it intrinsic validity a a judgement but also a a cognition generally accord to it quantity in comparison with that of other cognition it be then entirely different from a general judgement judicium commune and in a complete table of the momentum of thought deserve a separate placethough indeed this would not be necessary in a logic limit merely to the consideration of the use of judgement in reference to each other in like manner in transcendental logic infinite must be distinguish from affirmative judgement although in general logic they be rightly enough class under affirmative general logic abstract all content of the predicate though it be negative and only considers whether the say predicate be affirm or deny of the subject but transcendental logic considers also the worth or content of this logical affirmationan affirmation by mean of a merely negative predicate and inquire how much the sum total of our cognition gain by this affirmation for example if i say of the soul it be not mortalby this negative judgement i should at least ward off error now by the proposition the soul be not mortal i have in respect of the logical form really affirm inasmuch a i thereby place the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal being now because of the whole sphere of possible existence the mortal occupies one part and the immortal the other neither more nor less be affirm by the proposition than that the soul be one among the infinite multitude of thing which remain over when i take away the whole mortal part but by this proceeding we accomplish only this much that the infinite sphere of all possible existence be in so far limited that the mortal be exclude from it and the soul be place in the remain part of the extent of this sphere but this part remain notwithstanding this exception infinite and more and more part may be take away from the whole sphere without in the slight degree thereby augment or affirmatively determine our conception of the soul these judgement therefore infinite in respect of their logical extent be in respect of the content of their cognition merely limit and be consequently entitle to a place in our transcendental table of all the momentum of thought in judgement because the function of the understanding exercise by them may perhaps be of importance in the field of it pure a priori cognition all relation of thought in judgement be those a of the predicate to the subject b of the principle to it consequence c of the divided cognition and all the member of the division to each other in the first of these three class we consider only two conception in the second two judgement in the third several judgement in relation to each other the hypothetical proposition if perfect justice exist the obstinately wicked be punish contains properly the relation to each other of two proposition namely perfect justice exists and the obstinately wicked be punish whether these proposition be in themselves true be a question not here decided nothing be cogitate by mean of this judgement except a certain consequence finally the disjunctive judgement contain a relation of two or more proposition to each othera relation not of consequence but of logical opposition in so far a the sphere of the one proposition exclude that of the other but it contain at the same time a relation of community in so far a all the proposition take together fill up the sphere of the cognition the disjunctive judgement contains therefore the relation of the part of the whole sphere of a cognition since the sphere of each part be a complemental part of the sphere of the other each contribute to form the sum total of the divided cognition take for example the proposition the world exist either through blind chance or through internal necessity or through an external cause each of these proposition embrace a part of the sphere of our possible cognition a to the existence of a world all of them take together the whole sphere to take the cognition out of one of these sphere be equivalent to place it in one of the other and on the other hand to place it in one sphere be equivalent to take it out of the rest there be therefore in a disjunctive judgement a certain community of cognition which consist in this that they mutually exclude each other yet thereby determine a a whole the true cognition inasmuch a take together they make up the complete content of a particular give cognition and this be all that i find necessary for the sake of what follow to remark in this place the modality of judgement be a quite peculiar function with this distinguish characteristic that it contribute nothing to the content of a judgement for besides quantity quality and relation there be nothing more that constitute the content of a judgement but concern itself only with the value of the copula in relation to think in general problematical judgement be those in which the affirmation or negation be accept a merely possible ad libitum in the assertorical we regard the proposition a real true in the apodeictical we look on it a necessary thus the two judgement antecedens et consequens the relation of which constitute a hypothetical judgement likewise those the member of the division in whose reciprocity the disjunctive consists be only problematical in the example above give the proposition there exist perfect justice be not state assertorically but a an ad libitum judgement which someone may choose to adopt and the consequence alone be assertorical hence such judgement may be obviously false and yet take problematically be condition of our cognition of the truth thus the proposition the world exist only by blind chance be in the disjunctive judgement of problematical import only that be to say one may accept it for the moment and it help u like the indication of the wrong road among all the road that one can take to find out the true proposition the problematical proposition be therefore that which express only logical possibility which be not objective that be it express a free choice to admit the validity of such a propositiona merely arbitrary reception of it into the understand the assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth a for example in a hypothetical syllogism the antecedens present itself in a problematical form in the major in an assertorical form in the minor and it show that the proposition be in harmony with the law of the understand the apodeictical proposition cogitate the assertorical a determine by these very law of the understand consequently a affirm a priori and in this manner it express logical necessity now because all be here gradually incorporate with the understandinginasmuch a in the first place we judge problematically then accept assertorically our judgement a true lastly affirm it a inseparably unite with the understanding that be a necessary and apodeicticalwe may safely reckon these three function of modality a so many momentum of thought footnote just a if think be in the first instance a function of the understanding in the second of judgement in the third of reason a remark which will be explain in thesequel section iii of the pure conception of the understanding or category general logic a have be repeatedly say make abstraction of all content of cognition and expect to receive representation from some other quarter in order by mean of analysis to convert them into conception on the contrary transcendental logic have lie before it the manifold content of a priori sensibility which transcendental aesthetic present to it in order to give matter to the pure conception of the understanding without which transcendental logic would have nocontent and be therefore utterly void now space and time contain an infinite diversity of determination of pure a priori intuition but be nevertheless the condition of the mind receptivity under which alone it can obtain representation of object and which consequently must always affect the conception of these object but the spontaneity of thought require that this diversity be examine after a certain manner receive into the mind and connect in order afterwards to form a cognition out of it this process i call synthesis by the word synthesis in it most general signification i understand the process of join different representation to each other and of comprehend their diversity in one cognition this synthesis be pure when the diversity be not give empirically but a priori a that in space and time our representation must be give previously to any analysis of them and noconception can arise quoad their content analytically but the synthesis of a diversity be it give a priori or empirically be the first requisite for the production of a cognition which in it begin indeed may be crude and confused and therefore in need of analysisstill synthesis be that by which alone the element of our cognition be collect and unite into a certain content consequently it be the first thing on which we must fix our attention if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge synthesis generally speak be a we shall afterwards see the mere operation of the imaginationa blind but indispensable function of the soul without which we should have nocognition whatever but of the working of which we be seldom even conscious but to reduce this synthesis to conception be a function of the understanding by mean of which we attain to cognition in the proper meaning of the term pure synthesis represent generally give u the pure conception of the understanding but by this pure synthesis i mean that which rest upon a basis of a priori synthetical unity thus our numeration and this be more observable in large number be a synthesis accord to conception because it take place accord to a common basis of unity for example the decade by mean of this conception therefore the unity in the synthesis of the manifold become necessary by mean of analysis different representation be bring under one conceptionan operation of which general logic treat on the other hand the duty of transcendental logic be to reduce to conception not representation but the pure synthesis of representation the first thing which must be give to u for the sake of the a priori cognition of all object be the diversity of the pure intuition the synthesis of this diversity by mean of the imagination be the second but this give as yet nocognition the conception which give unity to this pure synthesis and which consist solely in the representation of this necessary synthetical unity furnish the third requisite for the cognition of an object and these conception be give by the understand the same function which give unity to the different representation in a judgement give also unity to the mere synthesis of different representation in an intuition and this unity we call the pure conception of the understanding thus the same understanding and by the same operation whereby in conception by mean of analytical unity it produce the logical form of a judgement introduces by mean of the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition a transcendental content into it representation on which account they be call pure conception of the understanding and they apply a priori to object a result not within the power of general logic in this manner there arise exactly so many pure conception of the understanding apply a priori to object of intuition in general a there be logical function in all possible judgement for there be noother function or faculty exist in the understanding besides those enumerate in that table these conception we shall with aristotle call categories our purpose be originally identical with hi notwithstanding the great difference in the execution table of the category of quantity of quality unity reality plurality negation totality limitation of relation of inherence and subsistence substantia et accidens of causality and dependence cause and effect of community reciprocity between the agent and patient of modality possibilityimpossibility existencenonexistence necessitycontingence this then be a catalogue of all the originally pure conception of the synthesis which the understanding contain a priori and these conception alone entitle it to be call a pure understand inasmuch a only by them it can render the manifold of intuition conceivable in other word think an object of intuition this division be make systematically from a common principle namely the faculty of judgement which be just the same a the power of thought and have not arise rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after pure conception respect the full number of which we never could be certain inasmuch a we employ induction alone in our search without consider that in this way we can never understand wherefore precisely these conception and none other abide in the pure understand it be a design worthy of an acute thinker like aristotle to search for these fundamental conception destitute however of any guide principle he pick them up just a they occur to him and at first hunt out ten which he call category predicament afterwards be believe that he have discover five other which be add under the name of post predicament but hi catalogue still remain defective besides there be to be find among them some of the mode of pure sensibility quando ubi situs also prius simul and likewise an empirical conception motuswhich can by nomean belong to this genealogical register of the pure understand moreover there be deduced conception actio passio enumerate among the original conception and of the latter some be entirely want with regard to these it be to be remark that the category a the true primitive conception of the pure understanding have also their pure deduce conception which in a complete system of transcendental philosophy must by nomean be pass over though in a merely critical essay we must be content with the simple mention of the fact let it be allow me to call these pure but deduce conception of the understand the predicables of the pure understanding in contradistinction to predicament if we be in possession of the original and primitive the deduced and subsidiary conception can easily be add and the genealogical tree of the understanding completely delineate a my present aim be not to set forth a complete system but merely the principle of one i reserve this task for another time it may be easily execute by any one who will refer to the ontological manual and subordinate to the category of causality for example the predicables of force action passion to that of community those of presence and resistance to the category of modality those of origination extinction change and so with the rest the category combine with the mode of pure sensibility or with one another afford a great number of deduce a priori conception a complete enumeration of which would be a useful and not unpleasant but in this place a perfectly dispensable occupation i purposely omit the definition of the category in this treatise i shall analyse these conception only so far a be necessary for the doctrine of method which be to form a part of this critique in a system of pure reason definition of them would be with justice demand of me but to give them here would only bide from our view the main aim of our investigation at the same time raise doubt and objection the consideration of which without injustice to our main purpose may be very well postpone till another opportunity meanwhile it ought to be sufficiently clear from the little we have already say on this subject that the formation of a complete vocabulary of pure conception accompany by all the requisite explanation be not only a possible but an easy undertake the compartment already exist it be only necessary to fill them up and a systematic topic like the present indicate with perfect precision the proper place to which each conception belong while it readily point out any that have not yet be fill up our table of the category suggest consideration of some importance which may perhaps have significant result in regard to the scientific form of all rational cognition for that this table be useful in the theoretical part of philosophy nay indispensable for the sketching of the complete plan of a science so far a that science rest upon conception a priori and for divide it mathematically accord to fix principle be most manifest from the fact that it contain all the elementary conception of the understanding nay even the form of a system of these in the understand itself and consequently indicate all the momentum and also the internal arrangement of a projected speculative science a i have elsewhere show footnote in the metaphysical principle of natural science here follow some of these observation i this table which contain four class of conception of the understanding may in the first instance be divide into two class the first of which relate to object of intuitionpure as well a empirical the second to the existence of these object either in relation to one another or to the understand the former of these class of category i would entitle the mathematical and the latter the dynamical category the former a we see have nocorrelate these be only to be find in the second class this difference must have a ground in the nature of the human understanding ii the number of the category in each class be always the same namely threea fact which also demand some consideration because in all other case division a priori through conception be necessarily dichotomy it be to be add that the third category in each triad always arise from the combination of the second with the first thus totality be nothing els but plurality contemplate a unity limitation be merely reality conjoin with negation community be the causality of a substance reciprocally determine and determine by other substance and finally necessity be nothing but existence which be give through the possibility itself let it not be suppose however that the third category be merely a deduced and not a primitive conception of the pure understand for the conjunction of the first and second in order to produce the third conception require a particular function of the understanding which be by nomean identical with those which be exercise in the first and second thus the conception of a number which belong to the category of totality be not always possible where the conception of multitude and unity exist for example in the representation of the infinite or if i conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance it do not follow that the conception of influence that be how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance will be understand from that thus it be evident that a particular act of the understanding be here necessary and so in the other instance iii with respect to one category namely that of community which be find in the third class it be not so easy a with the other to detect it accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement which correspond to it in the table of the logical function in order to assure ourselves of this accordance we must observe that in every disjunctive judgement the sphere of the judgement that be the complex of all that be contain in it be represent a a whole divide into part and since one part can not be contain in the other they be cogitate a coordinate with not subordinate to each other so that they do not determine each other unilaterally a in a linear series but reciprocally a in an aggregateif one member of the division be posit all the rest be exclude and conversely now a like connection be cogitate in a whole of thing for one thing be not subordinate a effect to another a cause of it existence but on the contrary be coordinate contemporaneously and reciprocally a a cause in relation to the determination of the other for example in a bodythe part of which mutually attract and repel each other and this be an entirely different kind of connection from that which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect the principle to the consequence for in such a connection the consequence do not in it turn determine the principle and therefore do not constitute with the latter a wholejust a the creator do not with the world make up a whole the process of understanding by which it represent to itself the sphere of a divided conception be employ also when we think of a thing a divisible and in the same manner a the member of the division in the former exclude one another and yet be connect in one sphere so the understanding represent to itself the part of the latter a havingeach of theman existence a substance independently of the other and yet a unite in one whole in the transcendental philosophy of the ancient there exist one more leading division which contain pure conception of the understanding and which although not number among the category ought accord to them a conception a priori to be valid of object but in this case they would augment the number of the category which can not be these be set forth in the proposition so renowned among the schoolmenquodlibet ens est unum verum bonum now though the inference from this principle be mere tautological proposition and though it be allow only by courtesy to retain a place in modern metaphysics yet a thought which maintain itself for such a length of time however empty it seem to be deserves an investigation of it origin and justify the conjecture that it must be ground in some law of the understanding which a be often the case have only be erroneously interpret these pretend transcendental predicate be in fact nothing but logical requisite and criterion of all cognition of object and they employ a the basis for this cognition the category of quantity namely unity plurality and totality but these which must be take a material condition that be a belong to the possibility of thing themselves they employ merely in a formal signification a belonging to the logical requisite of all cognition and yet most unguardedly change these criterion of thought into property of object a thing in themselves now in every cognition of an object there be unity of conception which may be call qualitative unity so far a by this term we understand only the unity in our connection of the manifold for example unity of the theme in a play an oration or a story secondly there be truth in respect of the deduction from it the more true deduction we have from a give conception the more criterion of it objective reality this we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic mark which belong to a conception a to a common foundation but be not cogitate a a quantity in it thirdly there be perfectionwhich consist in this that the plurality fall back upon the unity of the conception and accord completely with that conception and with noother this we may denominate qualitative completeness hence it be evident that these logical criterion of the possibility of cognition be merely the three category of quantity modify and transform to suit an unauthorized manner of apply them that be to say the three category in which the unity in the production of the quantum must be homogeneous throughout be transform solely with a view to the connection of heterogeneous part of cognition in one act of consciousness by mean of the quality of the cognition which be the principle of that connection thus the criterion of the possibility of a conception not of it object be the definition of it in which the unity of the conception the truth of all that may be immediately deduce from it and finally the completeness of what have be thus deduce constitute the requisite for the reproduction of the whole conception thus also the criterion or test of an hypothesis be the intelligibility of the received principle of explanation or it unity without help from any subsidiary hypothesisthe truth of our deduction from it consistency with each other and with experienceand lastly the completeness of the principle of the explanation of these deduction which refer to neither more nor less than what be admit in the hypothesis restore analytically and a posteriori what be cogitate synthetically and a priori by the conception therefore of unity truth and perfection we have make noaddition to the transcendental table of the category which be complete without them we have on the contrary merely employ the three category of quantity set aside their application to object of experience a general logical law of the consistency of cognition with itself chapter ii of the deduction of the pure conception of the understanding section i of the principle of a transcendental deduction in general teacher of jurisprudence when speaking of right and claim distinguish in a cause the question of right quid juris from the question of fact quid facti and while they demand proof of both they give to the proof of the former which go to establish right or claim in law the name of deduction now we make use of a great number of empirical conception without opposition from any one and consider ourselves even without any attempt at deduction justify in attach to them a sense and a supposititious signification because we have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective reality there exist also however usurped conception such a fortune fate which circulate with almost universal indulgence and yet be occasionally challenge by the question quid juris in such case we have great difficulty in discover any deduction for these term inasmuch a we can not produce any manifest ground of right either from experience or from reason on which the claim to employ them can be found among the many conception which make up the very variegated web of human cognition some be destine for pure use a priori independent of all experience and their title to be so employed always require a deduction inasmuch a to justify such use of them proof from experience be not sufficient but it be necessary to know how these conception can apply to object without be derive from experience i term therefore an examination of the manner in which conception can apply a priori to object the transcendental deduction of conception and i distinguish it from the empirical deduction which indicate the mode in which conception be obtain through experience and reflection thereon consequently do not concern itself with the right but only with the fact of our obtain conception in such and such a manner we have already see that we be in possession of two perfectly different kind of conception which nevertheless agree with each other in this that they both apply to object completely a priori these be the conception of space and time a form of sensibility and the category a pure conception of the understanding to attempt an empirical deduction of either of these class would be labour in vain because the distinguish characteristic of their nature consist in this that they apply to their object without have borrow anything from experience towards the representation of them consequently if a deduction of these conception be necessary it must always be transcendental meanwhile with respect to these conception a with respect to all our cognition we certainly may discover in experience if not the principle of their possibility yet the occasioning cause of their production it will be find that the impression of sense give the first occasion for bring into action the whole faculty of cognition and for the production of experience which contain two very dissimilar element namely a matter for cognition give by the sens and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter arise out of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought and these on occasion give by sensuous impression be call into exercise and produce conception such an investigation into the first effort of our faculty of cognition to mount from particular perception to general conception be undoubtedly of great utility and we have to thank the celebrated locke for have first open the way for this inquiry but a deduction of the pure a priori conception of course never can be make in this way see that in regard to their future employment which must be entirely independent of experience they must have a far different certificate of birth to show from that of a descent from experience this attempted physiological derivation which can not properly be call deduction because it relate merely to a quaestio facti i shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a pure cognition it be therefore manifest that there can only be a transcendental deduction of these conception and by nomean an empirical one also that all attempt at an empirical deduction in regard to pure a priori conception be vain and can only be make by one who do not understand the altogether peculiar nature of these cognition but although it be admit that the only possible deduction of pure a priori cognition be a transcendental deduction it be not for that reason perfectly manifest that such a deduction be absolutely necessary we have already trace to their source the conception of space and time by mean of a transcendental deduction and we have explain and determine their objective validity a priori geometry nevertheless advance steadily and securely in the province of pure a priori cognition without need to ask from philosophy any certificate a to the pure and legitimate origin of it fundamental conception of space but the use of the conception in this science extend only to the external world of sense the pure form of the intuition of which be space and in this world therefore all geometrical cognition because it be found upon a priori intuition posse immediate evidence and the object of this cognition be give a priori a regard their form in intuition by and through the cognition itself with the pure conception of understand on the contrary commences the absolute necessity of seek a transcendental deduction not only of these conception themselves but likewise of space because inasmuch a they make affirmation concern object not by mean of the predicate of intuition and sensibility but of pure think a priori they apply to object without any of the condition of sensibility besides not be found on experience they be not present with any object in a priori intuition upon which antecedently to experience they might base their synthesis hence result not only doubt a to the objective validity and proper limit of their use but that even our conception of space be render equivocal inasmuch a we be very ready with the aid of the category to carry the use of this conception beyond the condition of sensuous intuitionand for this reason we have already find a transcendental deduction of it needful the reader then must be quite convinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction before take a single step in the field of pure reason because otherwise he go to work blindly and after he have wonder about in all direction return to the state of utter ignorance from which he start he ought moreover clearly to recognize beforehand the unavoidable difficulty in hi undertaking so that he may not afterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself be deeply involved or become too soon impatient of the obstacle in hi path because we have a choice of only two thingseither at once to give up all pretension to knowledge beyond the limit of possible experience or to bring this critical investigation to completion we have be able with very little trouble to make it comprehensible how the conception of space and time although a priori cognition must necessarily apply to external object and render a synthetical cognition of these possible independently of all experience for inasmuch a only by mean of such pure form of sensibility an object can appear to u that be be an object of empirical intuition space and time be pure intuition which contain a priori the condition of the possibility of object a phenomenon and an a priori synthesis in these intuition posse objective validity on the other hand the category of the understanding do not represent the condition under which object be give to u in intuition object can consequently appear to u without necessarily connect themselves with these and consequently without any necessity binding on the understanding to contain a priori the condition of these object thus we find ourselves involve in a difficulty which do not present itself in the sphere of sensibility that be to say we can not discover how the subjective condition of thought can have objective validity in other word can become condition of the possibility of all cognition of object for phenomenon may certainly be give to u in intuition without any help from the function of the understanding let u take for example the conception of cause which indicate a peculiar kind of synthesis namely that with something a something entirely different b be connect accord to a law it be not a priori manifest why phenomenon should contain anything of this kind we be of course debar from appeal for proof to experience for the objective validity of this conception must be demonstrate a priori and it hence remain doubtful a priori whether such a conception be not quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomenon for that object of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal condition of sensibility exist a priori in the mind be quite evident from the fact that without these they could not be object for u but that they must also correspond to the condition which understand require for the synthetical unity of thought be an assertion the ground for which be not so easily to be discover for phenomenon might be so constituted a not to correspond to the condition of the unity of thought and all thing might lie in such confusion that for example nothing could be meet with in the sphere of phenomenon to suggest a law of synthesis and so correspond to the conception of cause and effect so that this conception would be quite void null and without significance phenomenon would nevertheless continue to present object to our intuition for mere intuition do not in any respect stand in need of the function of thought if we think to free ourselves from the labour of these investigation by say experience be constantly offer u example of the relation of cause and effect in phenomenon and present u with abundant opportunity of abstract the conception of cause and so at the same time of corroborate the objective validity of this conception we should in this case be overlook the fact that the conception of cause can not arise in this way at all that on the contrary it must either have an a priori basis in the understanding or be reject a a mere chimera for this conception demand that something a should be of such a nature that something els b should follow from it necessarily and accord to an absolutely universal law we may certainly collect from phenomena a law accord to which this or that usually happen but the element of necessity be not to be find in it hence it be evident that to the synthesis of cause and effect belong a dignity which be utterly want in any empirical synthesis for it be nomere mechanical synthesis by mean of addition but a dynamical one that be to say the effect be not to be cogitate a merely annex to the cause but a posit by and through the cause and result from it the strict universality of this law never can be a characteristic of empirical law which obtain through induction only a comparative universality that be an extended range of practical application but the pure conception of the understanding would entirely lose all their peculiar character if we treat them merely a the production of experience transition to the transcendental deduction of the category there be only two possible way in which synthetical representation and it object can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other and a it be meet together either the object alone make the representation possible or the representation alone make the object possible in the former case the relation between them be only empirical and an a priori representation be impossible and this be the case with phenomenon a regard that in them which be referable to mere sensation in the latter casealthough representation alone for of it causality by mean of the will we do not here speak do not produce the object a to it existence it must nevertheless be a priori determinative in regard to the object if it be only by mean of the representation that we can cognize anything a an object now there be only two condition of the possibility of a cognition of object firstly intuition by mean of which the object though only a phenomenon be give secondly conception by mean of which the object which correspond to this intuition be think but it be evident from what have be say on aesthetic that the first condition under which alone object can be intuit must in fact exist a a formal basis for them a priori in the mind with this formal condition of sensibility therefore all phenomenon necessarily correspond because it be only through it that they can be phenomena at all that be can be empirically intuited and give now the question be whether there do not exist a priori in the mind conception of understand also a condition under which alone something if not intuit be yet think a object if this question be answer in the affirmative it follow that all empirical cognition of object be necessarily conformable to such conception since if they be not presuppose it be impossible that anything can be an object of experience now all experience contain besides the intuition of the sens through which an object be give a conception also of an object that be give in intuition accordingly conception of object in general must lie a a priori condition at the foundation of all empirical cognition and consequently the objective validity of the category a a priori conception will rest upon this that experience as far a regard the form of thought be possible only by their mean for in that case they apply necessarily and a priori to object of experience because only through them can an object of experience be think the whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all a priori conception be to show that these conception be a priori condition of the possibility of all experience conception which afford u the objective foundation of the possibility of experience be for that very reason necessary but the analysis of the experience in which they be meet with be not deduction but only an illustration of them because from experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity without their original applicability and relation to all possible experience in which all object of cognition present themselves the relation of the category to object of whatever nature would be quite incomprehensible the celebrated locke for want of due reflection on these point and because he meet with pure conception of the understanding in experience sought also to deduce them from experience and yet proceed so inconsequently a to attempt with their aid to arrive it cognition which lie far beyond the limit of all experience david hume perceive that to render this possible it be necessary that the conception should have an a priori origin but a he could not explain how it be possible that conception which be not connect with each other in the understanding must nevertheless be think a necessarily connect in the objectand it never occur to him that the understand itself might perhaps by mean of these conception be the author of the experience in which it object be present to ithe be force to drive these conception from experience that be from a subjective necessity arise from repeat association of experience erroneously consider to be objectivein one word from habit but he proceed with perfect consequence and declare it to be impossible with such conception and the principle arise from them to overstep the limit of experience the empirical derivation however which both of these philosopher attribute to these conception can not possibly be reconcile with the fact that we do possess scientific a priori cognition namely those of pure mathematics and general physic the former of these two celebrate men open a wide door to extravagancefor if reason have once undoubted right on it side it will not allow itself to be confine to set limit by vague recommendation of moderation the latter give himself up entirely to scepticisma natural consequence after have discover a he think that the faculty of cognition be not trustworthy we now intend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct reason between these two rock to assign her determinate limit and yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity i shall merely premise an explanation of what the category be they be conception of an object in general by mean of which it intuition be contemplate a determine in relation to one of the logical function of judgement the following will make this plain the function of the categorical judgement be that of the relation of subject to predicate for example in the proposition all body be divisible but in regard to the merely logical use of the understanding it still remain undetermined to which of these two conception belong the function of subject and to which that of predicate for we could also say some divisible be a body but the category of substance when the conception of a body be bring under it determine that and it empirical intuition in experience must be contemplate always a subject and never a mere predicate and so with all the other category section ii transcendental deduction of the pure conception of the understanding of the possibility of a conjunction of the manifold representation give by sense the manifold content in our representation can be give in an intuition which be merely sensuousin other word be nothing but susceptibility and the form of this intuition can exist a priori in our faculty of representation without be anything els but the mode in which the subject be affect but the conjunction conjunctio of a manifold in intuition never can be give u by the sens it can not therefore be contain in the pure form of sensuous intuition for it be a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation and a we must to distinguish it from sensibility entitle this faculty understand so all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious be it of the manifold in intuition sensuous or nonsensuous or of several conceptionsis an act of the understanding to this act we shall give the general appellation of synthesis thereby to indicate at the same time that we can not represent anything a conjoin in the object without have previously conjoin it ourselves of all mental notion that of conjunction be the only one which can not be give through object but can be originate only by the subject itself because it be an act of it purely spontaneous activity the reader will easily enough perceive that the possibility of conjunction must be ground in the very nature of this act and that it must be equally valid for all conjunction and that analysis which appear to be it contrary must nevertheless always presuppose it for where the understanding have not previously conjoin it can not dissect or analyse because only as conjoin by it must that which be to be analyse have be give to our faculty of representation but the conception of conjunction include besides the conception of the manifold and of the synthesis of it that of the unity of it also conjunction be the representation of the synthetical unity of the manifold this idea of unity therefore can not arise out of that of conjunction much rather do that idea by combine itself with the representation of the manifold render the conception of conjunction possible this unity which a priori precedes all conception of conjunction be not the category of unity s for all the category be base upon logical function of judgement and in these function we already have conjunction and consequently unity of give conception it be therefore evident that the category of unity presupposes conjunction we must therefore look still high for this unity a qualitative s in that namely which contain the ground of the unity of diverse conception in judgement the ground consequently of the possibility of the existence of the understand even in regard to it logical use of the originally synthetical unity of apperception the i think must accompany all my representation for otherwise something would be represent in me which could not be think in other word the representation would either be impossible or at least be in relation to me nothing that representation which can be give previously to all think be call intuition all the diversity or manifold content of intuition have therefore a necessary relation to the i think in the subject in which this diversity be find but this representation i think be an act of spontaneity that be to say it can not be regard a belonging to mere sensibility i call it pure apperception in order to distinguish it from empirical or primitive apperception because it be selfconsciousness which whilst it give birth to the representation i think must necessarily be capable of accompany all our representation it be in all act of consciousness one and the same and unaccompanied by it norepresentation can exist for me the unity of this apperception i call the transcendental unity of selfconsciousness in order to indicate the possibility of a priori cognition arise from it for the manifold representation which be give in an intuition would not all of them be my representation if they do not all belong to one selfconsciousness that be a my representation even although i be not conscious of them a such they must conform to the condition under which alone they can exist together in a common selfconsciousness because otherwise they would not all without exception belong to me from this primitive conjunction follow many important result for example this universal identity of the apperception of the manifold give in intuition contain a synthesis of representation and be possible only by mean of the consciousness of this synthesis for the empirical consciousness which accompany different representation be in itself fragmentary and disunited and without relation to the identity of the subject this relation then do not exist because i accompany every representation with consciousness but because i join one representation to another and be conscious of the synthesis of them consequently only because i can connect a variety of give representation in one consciousness be it possible that i can represent to myself the identity of consciousness in these representation in other word the analytical unity of apperception be possible only under the presupposition of a synthetical unity the thought these representation give in intuition belong all of them to me be accordingly just the same a i unite them in one selfconsciousness or can at least so unite them and although this thought be not itself the consciousness of the synthesis of representation it presuppose the possibility of it that be to say for the reason alone that i can comprehend the variety of my representation in one consciousness do i call them my representation for otherwise i must have a manycoloured and various a self a be the representation of which i be conscious synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition a give a priori be therefore the foundation of the identity of apperception itself which antecede a priori all determinate think but the conjunction of representation into a conception be not to be find in object themselves nor can it be a it be borrow from them and take up into the understanding by perception but it be on the contrary an operation of the understand itself which be nothing more than the faculty of conjoin a priori and of bring the variety of give representation under the unity of apperception this principle be the high in all human cognition this fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception be indeed an identical and therefore analytical proposition but it nevertheless explain the necessity for a synthesis of the manifold give in an intuition without which the identity of selfconsciousness would be incogitable for the ego a a simple representation present u with nomanifold content only in intuition which be quite different from the representation ego can it be give u and by mean of conjunction it be cogitate in one selfconsciousness an understanding in which all the manifold should be give by mean of consciousness itself would be intuitive our understanding can only think and must look for it intuition to sense i be therefore conscious of my identical self in relation to all the variety of representation give to me in an intuition because i call all of them my representation in other word i be conscious myself of a necessary a priori synthesis of my representation which be call the original synthetical unity of apperception under which rank all the representation present to me but that only by mean of a synthesis the principle of the synthetical unity of apperception be the high principle of all exercise of the understand the supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to sensibility be accord to our transcendental aesthetic that all the manifold in intuition be subject to the formal condition of space and time the supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to the understanding be that all the manifold in it be subject to condition of the originally synthetical unity or apperception to the former of these two principle be subject all the various representation of intuition in so far a they be give to u to the latter in so far a they must be capable of conjunction in one consciousness for without this nothing can be think or cognize because the give representation would not have in common the act of the apperception i think and therefore could not be connect in one selfconsciousness understanding be to speak generally the faculty of cognition these consist in the determined relation of give representation to an object but an object be that in the conception of which the manifold in a give intuition be unite now all union of representation require unity of consciousness in the synthesis of them consequently it be the unity of consciousness alone that constitute the possibility of representation relate to an object and therefore of their objective validity and of their become cognition and consequently the possibility of the existence of the understand itself the first pure cognition of understand then upon which be found all it other exercise and which be at the same time perfectly independent of all condition of mere sensuous intuition be the principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception thus the mere form of external sensuous intuition namely space affords u per se nocognition it merely contribute the manifold in a priori intuition to a possible cognition but in order to cognize something in space for example a line i must draw it and thus produce synthetically a determined conjunction of the give manifold so that the unity of this act be at the same time the unity of consciousness in the conception of a line and by this mean alone be an object a determinate space cognize the synthetical unity of consciousness be therefore an objective condition of all cognition which i do not merely require in order to cognize an object but to which every intuition must necessarily be subject in order to become an object for me because in any other way and without this synthesis the manifold in intuition could not be unite in one consciousness this proposition be a already say itself analytical although it constitute the synthetical unity the condition of all thought for it state nothing more than that all my representation in any give intuition must be subject to the condition which alone enable me to connect them a my representation with the identical self and so to unite them synthetically in one apperception by mean of the general expression i think but this principle be not to be regard a a principle for every possible understanding but only for the understanding by mean of whose pure apperception in the thought i be nomanifold content be give the understanding or mind which contain the manifold in intuition in and through the act itself of it own selfconsciousness in other word an understanding by and in the representation of which the object of the representation should at the same time exist would not require a special act of synthesis of the manifold a the condition of the unity of it consciousness an act of which the human understand which think only and can not intuit have absolute need but this principle be the first principle of all the operation of our understand so that we can not form the least conception of any other possible understand either of one such a should be itself intuition or possess a sensuous intuition but with form different from those of space and time what objective unity of selfconsciousness be it be by mean of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the manifold give in an intuition be unite into a conception of the object on this account it be call objective and must be distinguish from the subjective unity of consciousness which be a determination of the internal sense by mean of which the say manifold in intuition be give empirically to be so united whether i can be empirically conscious of the manifold a coexistent or a successive depend upon circumstance or empirical condition hence the empirical unity of consciousness by mean of association of representation itself relate to a phenomenal world and be wholly contingent on the contrary the pure form of intuition in time merely a an intuition which contain a give manifold be subject to the original unity of consciousness and that solely by mean of the necessary relation of the manifold in intuition to the i think consequently by mean of the pure synthesis of the understanding which lie a priori at the foundation of all empirical synthesis the transcendental unity of apperception be alone objectively valid the empirical which we do not consider in this essay and which be merely a unity deduce from the former under give condition in concreto posse only subjective validity one person connect the notion convey in a word with one thing another with another thing and the unity of consciousness in that which be empirical be in relation to that which be give by experience not necessarily and universally valid the logical form of all judgement consist in the objective unity of apperception of the conception contain therein i could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians give of a judgement it be accord to them the representation of a relation between two conception i shall not dwell here on the faultiness of this definition in that it suit only for categorical and not for hypothetical or disjunctive judgement these latter contain a relation not of conception but of judgement themselvesa blunder from which many evil result have follow it be more important for our present purpose to observe that this definition do not determine in what the say relation consists but if i investigate more closely the relation of give cognition in every judgement and distinguish it a belong to the understanding from the relation which be produce accord to law of the reproductive imagination which have only subjective validity i find that judgement be nothing but the mode of bring give cognition under the objective unit of apperception this be plain from our use of the term of relation be in judgement in order to distinguish the objective unity of give representation from the subjective unity for this term indicate the relation of these representation to the original apperception and also their necessary unity even although the judgement be empirical therefore contingent a in the judgement all body be heavy i do not mean by this that these representation do necessarily belong to each other in empirical intuition but that by mean of the necessary unity of appreciation they belong to each other in the synthesis of intuition that be to say they belong to each other accord to principle of the objective determination of all our representation in so far a cognition can arise from them these principle be all deduce from the main principle of the transcendental unity of apperception in this way alone can there arise from this relation a judgement that be a relation which have objective validity and be perfectly distinct from that relation of the very same representation which have only subjective validitya relation to wit which be produce accord to law of association accord to these law i could only say when i hold in my hand or carry a body i feel an impression of weight but i could not say it the body be heavy for this be tantamount to say both these representation be conjoin in the object that be without distinction a to the condition of the subject and do not merely stand together in my perception however frequently the perceptive act may be repeat all sensuous intuition be subject to the category a condition under which alone the manifold content of them can be unite in one consciousness the manifold content give in a sensuous intuition come necessarily under the original synthetical unity of apperception because thereby alone be the unity of intuition possible s but that act of the understanding by which the manifold content of give representation whether intuition or conception be bring under one apperception be the logical function of judgement s all the manifold therefore in so far a it be give in one empirical intuition be determine in relation to one of the logical function of judgement by mean of which it be bring into union in one consciousness now the category be nothing els than these function of judgement so far a the manifold in a give intuition be determine in relation to them s consequently the manifold in a give intuition be necessarily subject to the category of the understanding observation the manifold in an intuition which i call mine be represent by mean of the synthesis of the understanding a belonging to the necessary unity of selfconsciousness and this take place by mean of the category the category indicate accordingly that the empirical consciousness of a give manifold in an intuition be subject to a pure selfconsciousness a priori in the same manner a an empirical intuition be subject to a pure sensuous intuition which be also a priori in the above proposition then lie the beginning of a deduction of the pure conception of the understanding now a the category have their origin in the understanding alone independently of sensibility i must in my deduction make abstraction of the mode in which the manifold of an empirical intuition be give in order to fix my attention exclusively on the unity which be bring by the understanding into the intuition by mean of the category in what follow s it will be show from the mode in which the empirical intuition be give in the faculty of sensibility that the unity which belong to it be noother than that which the category accord to s imposes on the manifold in a give intuition and thus it a priori validity in regard to all object of sense be establish the purpose of our deduction will be fully attain but there be one thing in the above demonstration of which i could not make abstraction namely that the manifold to be intuit must be give previously to the synthesis of the understanding and independently of it how this take place remain here undetermined for if i cogitate an understanding which be itself intuitive a for example a divine understand which should not represent give object but by whose representation the object themselves should be give or produce the category would possess nosignificance in relation to such a faculty of cognition they be merely rule for an understanding whose whole power consist in thought that be in the act of submit the synthesis of the manifold which be present to it in intuition from a very different quarter to the unity of apperception a faculty therefore which cognize nothing per se but only connects and arrange the material of cognition the intuition namely which must be present to it by mean of the object but to show reason for this peculiar character of our understanding that it produce unity of apperception a priori only by mean of category and a certain kind and number thereof be as impossible a to explain why we be endow with precisely so many function of judgement and nomore or why time and space be the only form of our intuition in cognition it application to object of experience be the only legitimate use of the category to think an object and to cognize an object be by nomean the same thing in cognition there be two element firstly the conception whereby an object be cogitate the category and secondly the intuition whereby the object be give for suppose that to the conception a corresponding intuition could not be give it would still be a thought a regard it form but without any object and nocognition of anything would be possible by mean of it inasmuch a so far a i know there exist and could exist nothing to which my thought could be apply now all intuition possible to u be sensuous consequently our thought of an object by mean of a pure conception of the understanding can become cognition for u only in so far a this conception be apply to object of the sens sensuous intuition be either pure intuition space and time or empirical intuitionof that which be immediately represent in space and time by mean of sensation a real through the determination of pure intuition we obtain a priori cognition of object a in mathematics but only a regard their form a phenomenon whether there can exist thing which must be intuit in this form be not thereby establish all mathematical conception therefore be not per se cognition except in so far a we presuppose that there exist thing which can only be represent conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition but thing in space and time be give only in so far a they be perception representation accompany with sensation therefore only by empirical representation consequently the pure conception of the understand even when they be apply to intuitions a priori a in mathematics produce cognition only in so far a these and therefore the conception of the understanding by mean of them can be apply to empirical intuition consequently the category do not even by mean of pure intuition afford u any cognition of thing they can only do so in so far a they can be apply to empirical intuition that be to say the category serve only to render empirical cognition possible but this be what we call experience consequently in cognition their application to object of experience be the only legitimate use of the category the foregoing proposition be of the utmost importance for it determine the limit of the exercise of the pure conception of the understanding in regard to object just a transcendental aesthetic determine the limit of the exercise of the pure form of our sensuous intuition space and time a condition of the possibility of the presentation of object to u be valid nofurther than for object of sense consequently only for experience beyond these limit they represent to u nothing for they belong only to sense and have noreality apart from it the pure conception of the understanding be free from this limitation and extend to object of intuition in general be the intuition like or unlike to ours provide only it be sensuous and not intellectual but this extension of conception beyond the range of our intuition be of noadvantage for they be then mere empty conception of object a to the possibility or impossibility of the existence of which they furnish u with nomean of discovery they be mere form of thought without objective reality because we have nointuition to which the synthetical unity of apperception which alone the category contain could be apply for the purpose of determine an object our sensuous and empirical intuition can alone give them significance and meaning if then we suppose an object of a nonsensuous intuition to be give we can in that case represent it by all those predicate which be imply in the presupposition that nothing appertain to sensuous intuition belongs to it for example that it be not extend or in space that it duration be not time that in it nochange the effect of the determination in time be to be meet with and so on but it be noproper knowledge if i merely indicate what the intuition of the object be not without be able to say what be contain in it for i have not show the possibility of an object to which my pure conception of understanding could be applicable because i have not be able to furnish any intuition corresponding to it but be only able to say that our intuition be not valid for it but the most important point be this that to a something of this kind not one category can be find applicable take for example the conception of substance that be something that can exist a subject but never a mere predicate in regard to this conception i be quite ignorant whether there can really be anything to correspond to such a determination of thought if empirical intuition do not afford me the occasion for it application but of this more in the sequel of the application of the category to object of the sens in general the pure conception of the understanding apply to object of intuition in general through the understanding alone whether the intuition be our own or some other provide only it be sensuous but be for this very reason mere form of thought by mean of which alone nodetermined object can be cognize the synthesis or conjunction of the manifold in these conception relate we have say only to the unity of apperception and be for this reason the ground of the possibility of a priori cognition in so far a this cognition be dependent on the understanding this synthesis be therefore not merely transcendental but also purely intellectual but because a certain form of sensuous intuition exists in the mind a priori which rest on the receptivity of the representative faculty sensibility the understanding a a spontaneity be able to determine the internal sense by mean of the diversity of give representation conformably to the synthetical unity of apperception and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition a priori a the condition to which must necessarily be submit all object of human intuition and in this manner the category a mere form of thought receive objective reality that be application to object which be give to u in intuition but that only a phenomenon for it be only of phenomenon that we be capable of a priori intuition this synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition which be possible and necessary a priori may be call figurative synthesis speciosa in contradistinction to that which be cogitate in the mere category in regard to the manifold of an intuition in general and be call connection or conjunction of the understanding synthesis intellectualis both be transcendental not merely because they themselves precede a priori all experience but also because they form the basis for the possibility of other cognition a priori but the figurative synthesis when it have relation only to the originally synthetical unity of apperception that be to the transcendental unity cogitate in the category must to be distinguish from the purely intellectual conjunction be entitle the transcendental synthesis of imagination imagination be the faculty of represent an object even without it presence in intuition now a all our intuition be sensuous imagination by reason of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the conception of the understanding belongs to sensibility but in so far a the synthesis of the imagination be an act of spontaneity which be determinative and not like sense merely determinable and which be consequently able to determine sense a priori accord to it form conformably to the unity of apperception in so far be the imagination a faculty of determine sensibility a priori and it synthesis of intuition accord to the category must be the transcendental synthesis of the imagination it be an operation of the understanding on sensibility and the first application of the understanding to object of possible intuition and at the same time the basis for the exercise of the other function of that faculty a figurative it be distinguish from the merely intellectual synthesis which be produce by the understand alone without the aid of imagination now in so far a imagination be spontaneity i sometimes call it also the productive imagination and distinguish it from the reproductive the synthesis of which be subject entirely to empirical law those of association namely and which therefore contribute nothing to the explanation of the possibility of a priori cognition and for this reason belong not to transcendental philosophy but to psychology we have now arrive at the proper place for explain the paradox which must have strike every one in our exposition of the internal sense s namelyhow this sense represent u to our own consciousness only a we appear to ourselves not a we be in ourselves because to wit we intuit ourselves only a we be inwardly affect now this appear to be contradictory inasmuch a we thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves and therefore in the system of psychology the internal sense be commonly hold to be one with the faculty of apperception while we on the contrary carefully distinguish them that which determine the internal sense be the understanding and it original power of conjoin the manifold of intuition that be of bring this under an apperception upon which rest the possibility of the understand itself now a the human understanding be not in itself a faculty of intuition and be unable to exercise such a power in order to conjoin a it be the manifold of it own intuition the synthesis of understanding be consider per se nothing but the unity of action of which a such it be selfconscious even apart from sensibility by which moreover it be able to determine our internal sense in respect of the manifold which may be present to it accord to the form of sensuous intuition thus under the name of a transcendental synthesis of imagination the understanding exercise an activity upon the passive subject whose faculty it be and so we be right in say that the internal sense be affect thereby apperception and it synthetical unity be by nomean one and the same with the internal sense the former a the source of all our synthetical conjunction applies under the name of the category to the manifold of intuition in general prior to all sensuous intuition of object the internal sense on the contrary contains merely the form of intuition but without any synthetical conjunction of the manifold therein and consequently do not contain any determined intuition which be possible only through consciousness of the determination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the imagination synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal sense which i have name figurative synthesis this we can indeed always perceive in ourselves we can not cogitate a geometrical line without draw it in think nor a circle without describe it nor represent the three dimension of space without draw three line from the same point perpendicular to one another we can not even cogitate time unless in draw a straight line which be to serve a the external figurative representation of time we fix our attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold whereby we determine successively the internal sense and thus attend also to the succession of this determination motion a an act of the subject not a a determination of an object consequently the synthesis of the manifold in space if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to the act by which we determine the internal sense accord to it form be that which produce the conception of succession the understanding therefore do by nomean find in the internal sense any such synthesis of the manifold but produce it in that it affect this sense at the same time how i who think be distinct from the i which intuit itself other mode of intuition be cogitable a at least possible and yet one and the same with this latter a the same subject how therefore i be able to say i a an intelligence and thinking subject cognize myself a an object thought so far a i be moreover give to myself in intuitiononly like other phenomenon not a i be in myself and a consider by the understanding but merely a i appearis a question that have in it neither more nor less difficulty than the questionhow can i be an object to myself or thishow i can be an object of my own intuition and internal perception but that such must be the fact if we admit that space be merely a pure form of the phenomenon of external sense can be clearly prove by the consideration that we can not represent time which be not an object of external intuition in any other way than under the image of a line which we draw in thought a mode of representation without which we could not cognize the unity of it dimension and also that we be necessitate to take our determination of period of time or of point of time for all our internal perception from the change which we perceive in outward thing it follow that we must arrange the determination of the internal sense a phenomenon in time exactly in the same manner a we arrange those of the external sens in space and consequently if we grant respect this latter that by mean of them we know object only in so far a we be affect externally we must also confess with regard to the internal sense that by mean of it we intuit ourselves only a we be internally affect by ourselves in other word a regard internal intuition we cognize our own subject only a phenomenon and not a it be in itself on the other hand in the transcendental synthesis of the manifold content of representation consequently in the synthetical unity of apperception i be conscious of myself not a i appear to myself nor a i be in myself but only that i be this representation be a thought not an intuition now a in order to cognize ourselves in addition to the act of think which subject the manifold of every possible intuition to the unity of apperception there be necessary a determinate mode of intuition whereby this manifold be give although my own existence be certainly not mere phenomenon much less mere illusion the determination of my existence can only take place conformably to the form of the internal sense accord to the particular mode in which the manifold which i conjoin be give in internal intuition and i have therefore noknowledge of myself a i be but merely a i appear to myself the consciousness of self be thus very far from a knowledge of self in which i do not use the category whereby i cogitate an object by mean of the conjunction of the manifold in one apperception in the same way a i require for the sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself not only the thought of an object in general in the category but also an intuition by which to determine that general conception in the same way do i require in order to the cognition of myself not only the consciousness of myself or the thought that i think myself but in addition an intuition of the manifold in myself by which to determine this thought it be true that i exist a an intelligence which be conscious only of it faculty of conjunction or synthesis but subject in relation to the manifold which this intelligence have to conjoin to a limit conjunction call the internal sense my intelligence that be i can render that conjunction or synthesis perceptible only accord to the relation of time which be quite beyond the proper sphere of the conception of the understanding and consequently cognize itself in respect to an intuition which can not possibly be intellectual nor give by the understand only a it appear to itself and not a it would cognize itself if it intuition be intellectual transcendental deduction of the universally possible employment in experience of the pure conception of the understanding in the metaphysical deduction the a priori origin of category be prove by their complete accordance with the general logical of thought in the transcendental deduction be exhibit the possibility of the category a a priori cognition of object of an intuition in general s and at present we be about to explain the possibility of cognize a priori by mean of the category all object which can possibly be present to our sens not indeed accord to the form of their intuition but accord to the law of their conjunction or synthesis and thus a it be of prescribe law to nature and even of render nature possible for if the category be inadequate to this task it would not be evident to u why everything that be present to our sens must be subject to those law which have an a priori origin in the understand itself i premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension i understand the combination of the manifold in an empirical intuition whereby perception that be empirical consciousness of the intuition a phenomenon be possible we have a priori form of the external and internal sensuous intuition in the representation of space and time and to these must the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always comformable because the synthesis itself can only take place accord to these form but space and time be not merely form of sensuous intuition but intuition themselves which contain a manifold and therefore contain a priori the determination of the unity of this manifold see the transcendent aesthetic therefore be unity of the synthesis of the manifold without or within u consequently also a conjunction to which all that be to be represent a determine in space or time must correspond give a priori along with not in these intuition a the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of them but this synthetical unity can be noother than that of the conjunction of the manifold of a give intuition in general in a primitive act of consciousness accord to the category but apply to our sensuous intuition consequently all synthesis whereby alone be even perception possible be subject to the category and a experience be cognition by mean of conjoined perception the category be condition of the possibility of experience and be therefore valid a priori for all object of experience when then for example i make the empirical intuition of a house by apprehension of the manifold contain therein into a perception the necessary unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lie at the foundation of this act and i a it be draw the form of the house conformably to this synthetical unity of the manifold in space but this very synthetical unity remain even when i abstract the form of space and have it seat in the understanding and be in fact the category of the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition that be to say the category of quantity to which the aforesaid synthesis of apprehension that be the perception must be completely conformable to take another example when i perceive the freezing of water i apprehend two state fluidity and solidity which a such stand toward each other mutually in a relation of time but in the time which i place a an internal intuition at the foundation of this phenomenon i represent to myself synthetical unity of the manifold without which the aforesaid relation could not be give in an intuition a determine in regard to the succession of time now this synthetical unity a the a priori condition under which i conjoin the manifold of an intuition be if i make abstraction of the permanent form of my internal intuition that be to say of time the category of cause by mean of which when apply to my sensibility i determine everything that occur accord to relation of time consequently apprehension in such an event and the event itself as far a regard the possibility of it perception stand under the conception of the relation of cause and effect and so in all other case category be conception which prescribe law a priori to phenomena consequently to nature a the complex of all phenomenon natura materialiter spectata and now the question arisesinasmuch a these category be not derive from nature and do not regulate themselves accord to her a their model for in that case they would be empiricalhow it be conceivable that nature must regulate herself accord to them in other word how the category can determine a priori the synthesis of the manifold of nature and yet not derive their origin from her the following be the solution of this enigma it be not in the least more difficult to conceive how the law of the phenomenon of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with it a priori formthat be it faculty of conjoin the manifoldthan it be to understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with the a priori form of our sensuous intuition for law do not exist in the phenomenon any more than the phenomena exist a thing in themselves law do not exist except by relation to the subject in which the phenomenon inhere in so far a it possess understand just a phenomenon have noexistence except by relation to the same exist subject in so far a it have sens to thing a thing in themselves conform to law must necessarily belong independently of an understanding to cognize them but phenomenon be only representation of thing which be utterly unknown in respect to what they be in themselves but a mere representation they stand under nolaw of conjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes now that which conjoin the manifold of sensuous intuition be imagination a mental act to which understand contributes unity of intellectual synthesis and sensibility manifold of apprehension now a all possible perception depend on the synthesis of apprehension and this empirical synthesis itself on the transcendental consequently on the category it be evident that all possible perception and therefore everything that can attain to empirical consciousness that be all phenomenon of nature must a regard their conjunction be subject to the category and nature consider merely a nature in general be dependent on them a the original ground of her necessary conform to law a natura formaliter spectata but the pure faculty of the understanding of prescribe law a priori to phenomena by mean of mere category be not competent to enounce other or more law than those on which a nature in general a a conform to law of phenomenon of space and time depend particular law inasmuch a they concern empirically determine phenomenon can not be entirely deduce from pure law although they all stand under them experience must be superadded in order to know these particular law but in regard to experience in general and everything that can be cognize a an object thereof these a priori law be our only rule and guide result of this deduction of the conception of the understanding we can not think any object except by mean of the category we can not cognize any thought except by mean of intuition correspond to these conception now all our intuition be sensuous and our cognition in so far a the object of it be give be empirical but empirical cognition be experience consequently noa priori cognition be possible for u except of object of possible experience but this cognition which be limit to object of experience be not for that reason derive entirely from experience butand this be assert of the pure intuition and the pure conception of the understandingthere be unquestionably element of cognition which exist in the mind a priori now there be only two way in which a necessary harmony of experience with the conception of it object can be cogitate either experience make these conception possible or the conception make experience possible the former of these statement will not bold good with respect to the category nor in regard to pure sensuous intuition for they be a priori conception and therefore independent of experience the assertion of an empirical origin would attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca consequently nothing remain but to adopt the second alternative which present u with a system a it be of the epigenesis of pure reason namely that on the part of the understand the category do contain the ground of the possibility of all experience but with respect to the question how they make experience possible and what be the principle of the possibility thereof with which they present u in their application to phenomena the following section on the transcendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform the reader it be quite possible that someone may propose a specie of preformationsystem of pure reasona middle way between the twoto wit that the category be neither innate and first a priori principle of cognition nor derive from experience but be merely subjective aptitude for thought implant in u contemporaneously with our existence which be so ordered and dispose by our creator that their exercise perfectly harmonize with the law of nature which regulate experience now not to mention that with such an hypothesis it be impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment of predetermined aptitude the fact that the category would in this case entirely lose that character of necessity which be essentially involve in the very conception of them be a conclusive objection to it the conception of cause for example which express the necessity of an effect under a presupposed condition would be false if it rest only upon such an arbitrary subjective necessity of unite certain empirical representation accord to such a rule of relation i could not then saythe effect be connect with it cause in the object that be necessarily but only i be so constituted that i can think this representation a so connect and not otherwise now this be just what the sceptic want for in this case all our knowledge depend on the suppose objective validity of our judgement be nothing but mere illusion nor would there be want people who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect to themselves though they must feel it at all event we could not dispute with any one on that which merely depend on the manner in which hi subject be organize short view of the above deduction the foregoing deduction be an exposition of the pure conception of the understanding and with them of all theoretical a priori cognition a principle of the possibility of experience but of experience a the determination of all phenomenon in space and time in generalof experience finally from the principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception a the form of the understanding in relation to time and space a original form of sensibility i consider the division by paragraph to be necessary only up to this point because we have to treat of the elementary conception a we now proceed to the exposition of the employment of these i shall not designate the chapter in this manner any further book ii analytic of principle general logic be construct upon a plan which coincide exactly with the division of the high faculty of cognition these be understand judgement and reason this science accordingly treat in it analytic of conception judgement and conclusion in exact correspondence with the function and order of those mental power which we include generally under the generic denomination of understand a this merely formal logic make abstraction of all content of cognition whether pure or empirical and occupy itself with the mere form of thought discursive cognition it must contain in it analytic a canon for reason for the form of reason have it law which without take into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about which it be employ can be discover a priori by the simple analysis of the action of reason into it momenta transcendental logic limit a it be to a determinate content that of pure a priori cognition to wit can not imitate general logic in this division for it be evident that the transcendental employment of reason be not objectively valid and therefore do not belong to the logic of truth that be to analytic but a a logic of illusion occupies a particular department in the scholastic system under the name of transcendental dialectic understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic a canon of objectively valid and therefore true exercise and be comprehend in the analytical department of that logic but reason in her endeavour to arrive by a priori mean at some true statement concern object and to extend cognition beyond the bound of possible experience be altogether dialectic and her illusory assertion can not be construct into a canon such a an analytic ought to contain accordingly the analytic of principle will be merely a canon for the faculty of judgement for the instruction of this faculty in it application to phenomena of the pure conception of the understanding which contain the necessary condition for the establishment of a priori law on this account although the subject of the following chapter be the especial principle of understand i shall make use of the term doctrine of the faculty of judgement in order to define more particularly my present purpose introduction of the transcendental faculty of judgement in general if understanding in general be define a the faculty of law or rule the faculty of judgement may be term the faculty of subsumption under these rule that be of distinguish whether this or that do or do not stand under a give rule casus data legis general logic contain nodirection or precept for the faculty of judgement nor can it contain any such for a it make abstraction of all content of cognition noduty be leave for it except that of expose analytically the mere form of cognition in conception judgement and conclusion and of thereby establish formal rule for all exercise of the understanding now if this logic wish to give some general direction how we should subsume under these rule that be how we should distinguish whether this or that do or do not stand under them this again could not be do otherwise than by mean of a rule but this rule precisely because it be a rule require for itself direction from the faculty of judgement thus it be evident that the understanding be capable of be instruct by rule but that the judgement be a peculiar talent which do not and can not require tuition but only exercise this faculty be therefore the specific quality of the socalled mother wit the want of which noscholastic discipline can compensate for although education may furnish and a it be engraft upon a limited understanding rule borrow from other mind yet the power of employ these rule correctly must belong to the pupil himself and norule which we can prescribe to him with this purpose be in the absence or deficiency of this gift of nature secure from misuse a physician therefore a judge or a statesman may have in hi head many admirable pathological juridical or political rule in a degree that may enable him to be a profound teacher in hi particular science and yet in the application of these rule he may very possibly blundereither because he be want in natural judgement though not in understand and whilst he can comprehend the general in abstracto can not distinguish whether a particular case in concreto ought to rank under the former or because hi faculty of judgement have not be sufficiently exercise by example and real practice indeed the grand and only use of example be to sharpen the judgement for a regard the correctness and precision of the insight of the understanding example be commonly injurious rather than otherwise because a casus in termini they seldom adequately fulfil the condition of the rule besides they often weaken the power of our understand to apprehend rule or law in their universality independently of particular circumstance of experience and hence accustom u to employ them more a formula than a principle example be thus the gocart of the judgement which he who be naturally deficient in that faculty can not afford to dispense with but although general logic can not give direction to the faculty of judgement the case be very different a regard transcendental logic insomuch that it appear to be the especial duty of the latter to secure and direct by mean of determinate rule the faculty of judgement in the employment of the pure understand for a a doctrine that be a an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of the understanding in regard to pure a priori cognition philosophy be bad than useless since from all the attempt hitherto make little or noground have be gain but a a critique in order to guard against the mistake of the faculty of judgement lapsus judicii in the employment of the few pure conception of the understanding which we possess although it use be in this case purely negative philosophy be call upon to apply all it acuteness and penetration but transcendental philosophy have this peculiarity that besides indicate the rule or rather the general condition for rule which be give in the pure conception of the understand it can at the same time indicate a priori the case to which the rule must be apply the cause of the superiority which in this respect transcendental philosophy posse above all other science except mathematics lie in this it treat of conception which must relate a priori to their object whose objective validity consequently can not be demonstrate a posteriori and be at the same time under the obligation of present in general but sufficient test the condition under which object can be give in harmony with those conception otherwise they would be mere logical form without content and not pure conception of the understanding our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will contain two chapter the first will treat of the sensuous condition under which alone pure conception of the understanding can be employedthat be of the schematism of the pure understand the second will treat of those synthetical judgement which be derive a priori from pure conception of the understanding under those condition and which lie a priori at the foundation of all other cognition that be to say it will treat of the principle of the pure understand transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement or analytic of principle chapter i of the schematism at of the pure conception of the understanding in all subsumption of an object under a conception the representation of the object must be homogeneous with the conception in other word the conception must contain that which be represent in the object to be subsume under it for this be the meaning of the expression an object be contain under a conception thus the empirical conception of a plate be homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of a circle inasmuch a the roundness which be cogitate in the former be intuit in the latter but pure conception of the understanding when compare with empirical intuition or even with sensuous intuition in general be quite heterogeneous and never can be discover in any intuition how then be the subsumption of the latter under the former and consequently the application of the category to phenomena possiblefor it be impossible to say for example causality can be intuit through the sens and be contain in the phenomenonthis natural and important question form the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement with the purpose to wit of show how pure conception of the understanding can be apply to phenomena in all other science where the conception by which the object be think in the general be not so different and heterogeneous from those which represent the object in concretoas it be give it be quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiry concern the application of the former to the latter now it be quite clear that there must be some third thing which on the one side be homogeneous with the category and with the phenomenon on the other and so make the application of the former to the latter possible this mediating representation must be pure without any empirical content and yet must on the one side be intellectual on the other sensuous such a representation be the transcendental schema the conception of the understanding contain pure synthetical unity of the manifold in general time a the formal condition of the manifold of the internal sense consequently of the conjunction of all representation contain a priori a manifold in the pure intuition now a transcendental determination of time be so far homogeneous with the category which constitute the unity thereof that it be universal and rest upon a rule a priori on the other hand it be so far homogeneous with the phenomenon inasmuch a time be contain in every empirical representation of the manifold thus an application of the category to phenomena becomes possible by mean of the transcendental determination of time which a the schema of the conception of the understanding mediate the subsumption of the latter under the former after what have be prove in our deduction of the category noone it be to be hop can hesitate a to the proper decision of the question whether the employment of these pure conception of the understanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental in other word whether the category a condition of a possible experience relate a priori solely to phenomena or whether a condition of the possibility of thing in general their application can be extend to object a thing in themselves for we have there see that conception be quite impossible and utterly without signification unless either to them or at least to the element of which they consist an object be give and that consequently they can not possibly apply to object a thing in themselves without regard to the question whether and how these may be give to u and far that the only manner in which object can be give to u be by mean of the modification of our sensibility and finally that pure a priori conception in addition to the function of the understanding in the category must contain a priori formal condition of sensibility of the internal sense namely which again contain the general condition under which alone the category can be apply to any object this formal and pure condition of sensibility to which the conception of the understanding be restrict in it employment we shall name the schema of the conception of the understanding and the procedure of the understanding with these schema we shall call the schematism of the pure understand the schema be in itself always a mere product of the imagination but a the synthesis of imagination have for it aim nosingle intuition but merely unity in the determination of sensibility the schema be clearly distinguishable from the image thus if i place five point one after another this be an image of the number five on the other hand if i only think a number in general which may be either five or a hundred this thought be rather the representation of a method of represent in an image a sum eg a thousand in conformity with a conception than the image itself an image which i should find some little difficulty in review and compare with the conception now this representation of a general procedure of the imagination to present it image to a conception i call the schema of this conception in truth it be not image of object but schema which lie at the foundation of our pure sensuous conception noimage could ever be adequate to our conception of a triangle in general for the generalness of the conception it never could attain to a this include under itself all triangle whether rightangled acuteangled etc whilst the image would always be limit to a single part of this sphere the schema of the triangle can exist nowhere els than in thought and it indicate a rule of the synthesis of the imagination in regard to pure figure in space still less be an object of experience or an image of the object ever to the empirical conception on the contrary the conception always relate immediately to the schema of the imagination a a rule for the determination of our intuition in conformity with a certain general conception the conception of a dog indicate a rule accord to which my imagination can delineate the figure of a fourfooted animal in general without be limit to any particular individual form which experience present to me or indeed to any possible image that i can represent to myself in concreto this schematism of our understanding in regard to phenomena and their mere form be an art hidden in the depth of the human soul whose true mode of action we shall only with difficulty discover and unveil thus much only can we say the image be a product of the empirical faculty of the productive imaginationthe schema of sensuous conception of figure in space for example be a product and a it be a monogram of the pure imagination a priori whereby and accord to which image first become possible which however can be connect with the conception only mediately by mean of the schema which they indicate and be in themselves never fully adequate to it on the other hand the schema of a pure conception of the understanding be something that can not be reduce into any imageit be nothing els than the pure synthesis express by the category conformably to a rule of unity accord to conception it be a transcendental product of the imagination a product which concern the determination of the internal sense accord to condition of it form time in respect to all representation in so far a these representation must be conjoin a priori in one conception conformably to the unity of apperception without enter upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential requisite of transcendental schema of the pure conception of the understanding we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanation of them accord to the order of the category and in connection therewith for the external sense the pure image of all quantity quantorum be space the pure image of all object of sense in general be time but the pure schema of quantity quantitatis a a conception of the understanding be number a representation which comprehend the successive addition of one to one homogeneous quantity thus number be nothing els than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold in a homogeneous intuition by mean of my generating time itself in my apprehension of the intuition reality in the pure conception of the understanding be that which correspond to a sensation in general that consequently the conception of which indicate a be in time negation be that the conception of which represent a notbeing in time the opposition of these two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same time a a time fill or a time empty now a time be only the form of intuition consequently of object a phenomenon that which in object corresponds to sensation be the transcendental matter of all object a thing in themselves sachheit reality now every sensation have a degree or quantity by which it can fill time that be to say the internal sense in respect of the representation of an object more or less until it vanish into nothing = = negatio thus there be a relation and connection between reality and negation or rather a transition from the former to the latter which make every reality representable to u a a quantum and the schema of a reality a the quantity of something in so far a it fill time be exactly this continuous and uniform generation of the reality in time a we descend in time from the sensation which have a certain degree down to the vanish thereof or gradually ascend from negation to the quantity thereof the schema of substance be the permanence of the real in time that be the representation of it a a substratum of the empirical determination of time a substratum which therefore remain whilst all els change time pass not but in it pass the existence of the changeable to time therefore which be itself unchangeable and permanent corresponds that which in the phenomenon be unchangeable in existence that be substance and it be only by it that the succession and coexistence of phenomenon can be determine in regard to time the schema of cause and of the causality of a thing be the real which when posit be always follow by something els it consist therefore in the succession of the manifold in so far a that succession be subject to a rule the schema of community reciprocity of action and reaction or the reciprocal causality of substance in respect of their accident be the coexistence of the determination of the one with those of the other accord to a general rule the schema of possibility be the accordance of the synthesis of different representation with the condition of time in general a for example opposite can not exist together at the same time in the same thing but only after each other and be therefore the determination of the representation of a thing at any time the schema of reality be existence in a determined time the schema of necessity be the existence of an object in all time it be clear from all this that the schema of the category of quantity contains and represent the generation synthesis of time itself in the successive apprehension of an object the schema of quality the synthesis of sensation with the representation of time or the fill up of time the schema of relation the relation of perception to each other in all time that be accord to a rule of the determination of time and finally the schema of modality and it category time itself a the correlative of the determination of an objectwhether it do belong to time and how the schema therefore be nothing but a priori determination of time accord to rule and these in regard to all possible object follow the arrangement of the category relate to the series in time the content in time the order in time and finally to the complex or totality in time hence it be apparent that the schematism of the understanding by mean of the transcendental synthesis of the imagination amount to nothing els than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception a a function correspond to the internal sense a receptivity thus the schema of the pure conception of the understanding be the true and only condition whereby our understand receive an application to object and consequently significance finally therefore the category be only capable of empirical use inasmuch a they serve merely to subject phenomenon to the universal rule of synthesis by mean of an a priori necessary unity on account of the necessary union of all consciousness in one original apperception and so to render them susceptible of a complete connection in one experience but within this whole of possible experience lie all our cognition and in the universal relation to this experience consist transcendental truth which antecede all empirical truth and render the latter possible it be however evident at first sight that although the schema of sensibility be the sole agent in realize the category they do nevertheless also restrict them that be they limit the category by condition which lie beyond the sphere of understandingnamely in sensibility hence the schema be properly only the phenomenon or the sensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category numerus est quantitas phaenomenonsensatio realitas phaenomenon constans et perdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenonaeternitas necessitas phaenomena etc now if we remove a restrictive condition we thereby amplify it appear the formerly limited conception in this way the category in their pure signification free from all condition of sensibility ought to be valid of thing a they be and not a the schema represent them merely a they appear and consequently the category must have a significance far more extended and wholly independent of all schema in truth there do always remain to the pure conception of the understanding after abstract every sensuous condition a value and significance which be however merely logical but in this case noobject be give them and therefore they have nomeaning sufficient to afford u a conception of an object the notion of substance for example if we leave out the sensuous determination of permanence would mean nothing more than a something which can be cogitate a subject without the possibility of become a predicate to anything els of this representation i can make nothing inasmuch a it do not indicate to me what determinations the thing possess which must thus be valid a premier subject consequently the category without schema be merely function of the understanding for the production of conception but do not represent any object this significance they derive from sensibility which at the same time realize the understanding and restrict it chapter ii system of all principle of the pure understanding in the foregoing chapter we have merely consider the general condition under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement be justify in use the pure conception of the understanding for synthetical judgement our duty at present be to exhibit in systematic connection those judgement which the understanding really produce a priori for this purpose our table of the category will certainly afford u the natural and safe guidance for it be precisely the category whose application to possible experience must constitute all pure a priori cognition of the understanding and the relation of which to sensibility will on that very account present u with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principle of the use of the understanding principle a priori be so call not merely because they contain in themselves the ground of other judgement but also because they themselves be not ground in high and more general cognition this peculiarity however do not raise them altogether above the need of a proof for although there could be find nohigh cognition and therefore noobjective proof and although such a principle rather serve a the foundation for all cognition of the object this by nomean hinders u from draw a proof from the subjective source of the possibility of the cognition of an object such a proof be necessary moreover because without it the principle might be liable to the imputation of be a mere gratuitous assertion in the second place we shall limit our investigation to those principle which relate to the category for a to the principle of transcendental aesthetic accord to which space and time be the condition of the possibility of thing as phenomenon a also the restriction of these principle namely that they can not be apply to object a thing in themselvesthese of course do not fall within the scope of our present inquiry in like manner the principle of mathematical science form nopart of this system because they be all drawn from intuition and not from the pure conception of the understand the possibility of these principle however will necessarily be consider here inasmuch a they be synthetical judgement a priori not indeed for the purpose of prove their accuracy and apodeictic certainty which be unnecessary but merely to render conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident a priori cognition but we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical judgement in opposition to synthetical judgement which be the proper subject of our inquiry because this very opposition will free the theory of the latter from all ambiguity and place it clearly before our eye in it true nature system of the principle of the pure understanding section i of the supreme principle of all analytical judgement whatever may be the content of our cognition and in whatever manner our cognition may be relate to it object the universal although only negative condition of all our judgement be that they do not contradict themselves otherwise these judgement be in themselves even without respect to the object nothing but although there may exist nocontradiction in our judgement it may nevertheless connect conception in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object or without any ground either a priori or a posteriori for arrive at such a judgement and thus without be selfcontradictory a judgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless now the proposition nosubject can have a predicate that contradict it be call the principle of contradiction and be a universal but purely negative criterion of all truth but it belong to logic alone because it be valid of cognition merely a cognition and without respect to their content and declare that the contradiction entirely nullify them we can also however make a positive use of this principle that be not merely to banish falsehood and error in so far a it rest upon contradiction but also for the cognition of truth for if the judgement be analytical be it affirmative or negative it truth must always be recognizable by mean of the principle of contradiction for the contrary of that which lie and be cogitate a conception in the cognition of the object will be always properly negative but the conception itself must always be affirm of the object inasmuch a the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to the object we must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the universal and fully sufficient principle of all analytical cognition but a a sufficient criterion of truth it have nofurther utility or authority for the fact that nocognition can be at variance with this principle without nullify itself constitute this principle the sine qua non but not the determine ground of the truth of our cognition a our business at present be properly with the synthetical part of our knowledge only we shall always be on our guard not to transgress this inviolable principle but at the same time not to expect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth of any synthetical proposition there exist however a formula of this celebrate principlea principle merely formal and entirely without contentwhich contain a synthesis that have be inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up with it it be this it be impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time not to mention the superfluousness of the addition of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty which ought to be selfevident from the proposition itself the proposition be affect by the condition of time and a it be say a thing = a which be something = b can not at the same time be nonb but both b as well a nonb may quite well exist in succession for example a man who be young can not at the same time be old but the same man can very well be at one time young and at another not young that be old now the principle of contradiction a a merely logical proposition must not by any mean limit it application merely to relation of time and consequently a formula like the preceding be quite foreign to it true purpose the misunderstanding arise in this way we first of all separate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing and afterwards connect with this predicate it opposite and hence do not establish any contradiction with the subject but only with it predicate which have be conjoin with the subject syntheticallya contradiction moreover which obtain only when the first and second predicate be affirm in the same time if i say a man who be ignorant be not learn the condition at the same time must be add for he who be at one time ignorant may at another be learn but if i say noignorant man be a learned man the proposition be analytical because the characteristic ignorance be now a constituent part of the conception of the subject and in this case the negative proposition be evident immediately from the proposition of contradiction without the necessity of add the condition the same time this be the reason why i have alter the formula of this principlean alteration which show very clearly the nature of an analytical proposition section ii of the supreme principle of all synthetical judgement the explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgement be a task with which general logic have nothing to do indeed she need not even be acquaint with it name but in transcendental logic it be the most important matter to be dealt withindeed the only one if the question be of the possibility of synthetical judgement a priori the condition and extent of their validity for when this question be fully decide it can reach it aim with perfect ease the determination to wit of the extent and limit of the pure understanding in an analytical judgement i do not go beyond the give conception in order to arrive at some decision respect it if the judgement be affirmative i predicate of the conception only that which be already cogitate in it if negative i merely exclude from the conception it contrary but in synthetical judgement i must go beyond the give conception in order to cogitate in relation with it something quite different from that which be cogitate in it a relation which be consequently never one either of identity or contradiction and by mean of which the truth or error of the judgement can not be discern merely from the judgement itself grant then that we must go out beyond a give conception in order to compare it synthetically with another a third thing be necessary in which alone the synthesis of two conception can originate now what be this tertium quid that be to be the medium of all synthetical judgement it be only a complex in which all our representation be contain the internal sense to wit and it form a priori time the synthesis of our representation rest upon the imagination their synthetical unity which be requisite to a judgement upon the unity of apperception in this therefore be to be seek the possibility of synthetical judgement and a all three contain the source of a priori representation the possibility of pure synthetical judgement also nay they be necessary upon these ground if we be to possess a knowledge of object which rest solely upon the synthesis of representation if a cognition be to have objective reality that be to relate to an object and posse sense and meaning in respect to it it be necessary that the object be give in some way or another without this our conception be empty and we may indeed have think by mean of them but by such thinking we have not in fact cognize anything we have merely play with representation to give an object if this expression be understand in the sense of to present the object not mediately but immediately in intuition mean nothing els than to apply the representation of it to experience be that experience real or only possible space and time themselves pure a these conception be from all that be empirical and certain a it be that they be represent fully a priori in the mind would be completely without objective validity and without sense and significance if their necessary use in the object of experience be not show nay the representation of them be a mere schema that always relate to the reproductive imagination which call up the object of experience without which they have nomeaning and so it be with all conception without distinction the possibility of experience be then that which give objective reality to all our a priori cognition now experience depend upon the synthetical unity of phenomenon that be upon a synthesis accord to conception of the object of phenomenon in general a synthesis without which experience never could become knowledge but would be merely a rhapsody of perception never fit together into any connected text accord to rule of a thoroughly united possible consciousness and therefore never subject to the transcendental and necessary unity of apperception experience have therefore for a foundation a priori principle of it form that be to say general rule of unity in the synthesis of phenomenon the objective reality of which rule a necessary condition even of the possibility of experience can which rule a necessary conditionseven of the possibility of experiencecan always be show in experience but apart from this relation a priori synthetical proposition be absolutely impossible because they have nothird term that be nopure object in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of it conception although then respect space or the form which productive imagination describes therein we do cognize much a priori in synthetical judgement and be really in noneed of experience for this purpose such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but a busy trifle with a mere chimera be not space to be consider a the condition of the phenomenon which constitute the material of external experience hence those pure synthetical judgement do relate though but mediately to possible experience or rather to the possibility of experience and upon that alone be found the objective validity of their synthesis while then on the one hand experience a empirical synthesis be the only possible mode of cognition which give reality to all other synthesis on the other hand this latter synthesis a cognition a priori posse truth that be accordance with it object only in so far a it contain nothing more than what be necessary to the synthetical unity of experience accordingly the supreme principle of all synthetical judgement be every object be subject to the necessary condition of the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience a priori synthetical judgement be possible when we apply the formal condition of the a priori intuition the synthesis of the imagination and the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental apperception to a possible cognition of experience and say the condition of the possibility of experience in general be at the same time condition of the possibility of the object of experience and have for that reason objective validity in an a priori synthetical judgement section iii systematic representation of all synthetical principle of the pure understanding that principle exist at all be to be ascribe solely to the pure understand which be not only the faculty of rule in regard to that which happen but be even the source of principle accord to which everything that can be present to u a an object be necessarily subject to rule because without such rule we never could attain to cognition of an object even the law of nature if they be contemplate a principle of the empirical use of the understanding posse also a characteristic of necessity and we may therefore at least expect them to be determine upon ground which be valid a priori and antecedent to all experience but all law of nature without distinction be subject to high principle of the understanding inasmuch a the former be merely application of the latter to particular case of experience these high principle alone therefore give the conception which contain the necessary condition and a it be the exponent of a rule experience on the other hand give the case which come under the rule there be nodanger of our mistake merely empirical principle for principle of the pure understanding or conversely for the character of necessity accord to conception which distinguish the latter and the absence of this in every empirical proposition how extensively valid soever it may be be a perfect safeguard against confound them there be however pure principles a priori which nevertheless i should not ascribe to the pure understandingfor this reason that they be not derive from pure conception but although by the mediation of the understanding from pure intuition but understanding be the faculty of conception such principle mathematical science posse but their application to experience consequently their objective validity nay the possibility of such a priori synthetical cognition the deduction thereof rest entirely upon the pure understand on this account i shall not reckon among my principle those of mathematics though i shall include those upon the possibility and objective validity a priori of principle of the mathematical science which consequently be to be look upon a the principle of these and which proceed from conception to intuition and not from intuition to conception in the application of the pure conception of the understanding to possible experience the employment of their synthesis be either mathematical or dynamical for it be direct partly on the intuition alone partly on the existence of a phenomenon but the a priori condition of intuition be in relation to a possible experience absolutely necessary those of the existence of object of a possible empirical intuition be in themselves contingent hence the principle of the mathematical use of the category will possess a character of absolute necessity that be will be apodeictic those on the other hand of the dynamical use the character of an a priori necessity indeed but only under the condition of empirical thought in an experience therefore only mediately and indirectly consequently they will not possess that immediate evidence which be peculiar to the former although their application to experience do not for that reason lose it truth and certitude but of this point we shall be well able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principle the table of the category be naturally our guide to the table of principle because these be nothing els than rule for the objective employment of the former accordingly all principle of the pure understanding be axiom of intuition anticipationsanalogies of perception of experience postulatesof empiricalthought ingeneral these appellation i have choose advisedly in order that we might not lose sight of the distinction in respect of the evidence and the employment of these principle it will however soon appear thata fact which concern both the evidence of these principle and the a priori determination of phenomenaaccording to the category of quantity and quality if we attend merely to the form of these the principle of these category be distinguishable from those of the two other in as much a the former be possess of an intuitive but the latter of a merely discursive though in both instance a complete certitude i shall therefore call the former mathematical and the latter dynamical principle it must be observe however that by these term i mean just as little in the one case the principle of mathematics a those of general physical dynamic in the other i have here in view merely the principle of the pure understand in their application to the internal sense without distinction of the representation give therein by mean of which the science of mathematics and dynamic become possible accordingly i have name these principle rather with reference to their application than their content and i shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which they stand in the table axiom of intuition the principle of these be all intuition be extensive quantity proof all phenomena contain a regard their form an intuition in space and time which lie a priori at the foundation of all without exception phenomenon therefore can not be apprehend that be receive into empirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a manifold through which the representation of a determinate space or time be generate that be to say through the composition of the homogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of this manifold homogeneous now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold in intuition in so far a thereby the representation of an object be render possible be the conception of a quantity quanti consequently even the perception of an object a phenomenon be possible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the give sensuous intuition through which the unity of the composition of the homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity be cogitate that be to say all phenomenon be quantity and extensive quantity because a intuition in space or time they must be represent by mean of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves be determine an extensive quantity i call that wherein the representation of the part render possible and therefore necessarily antecede the representation of the whole i can not represent to myself any line however small without draw it in thought that be without generate from a point all it part one after another and in this way alone produce this intuition precisely the same be the case with every even the small portion of time i cogitate therein only the successive progress from one moment to another and hence by mean of the different portion of time and the addition of them a determinate quantity of time be produce a the pure intuition in all phenomenon be either time or space so be every phenomenon in it character of intuition an extensive quantity inasmuch a it can only be cognize in our apprehension by successive synthesis from part to part all phenomenon be accordingly to be consider a aggregate that be a a collection of previously give part which be not the case with every sort of quantity but only with those which be represent and apprehend by u a extensive on this successive synthesis of the productive imagination in the generation of figure be found the mathematics of extension or geometry with it axiom which express the condition of sensuous intuition a priori under which alone the schema of a pure conception of external intuition can exist for example be tween two point only one straight line be possible two straight line can not enclose a space etc these be the axiom which properly relate only to quantity quanta a such but a regard the quantity of a thing quantitas that be to say the answer to the question how large be this or that object although in respect to this question we have various proposition synthetical and immediately certain indemonstrabilia we have in the proper sense of the term noaxiom for example the proposition if equal be add to equal the whole be equal if equal be take from equal the remainder be equal be analytical because i be immediately conscious of the identity of the production of the one quantity with the production of the other whereas axiom must be a priori synthetical proposition on the other hand the selfevident proposition a to the relation of number be certainly synthetical but not universal like those of geometry and for this reason can not be call axiom but numerical formula that + = be not an analytical proposition for neither in the representation of seven nor of five nor of the composition of the two number do i cogitate the number twelve whether i cogitate the number in the addition of both be not at present the question for in the case of an analytical proposition the only point be whether i really cogitate the predicate in the representation of the subject but although the proposition be synthetical it be nevertheless only a singular proposition in so far a regard be here have merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous the unit it can not take place except in one manner although our use of these number be afterwards general if i say a triangle can be construct with three line any two of which take together be great than the third i exercise merely the pure function of the productive imagination which may draw the line longer or short and construct the angle at it pleasure on the contrary the number seven be possible only in one manner and so be likewise the number twelve which result from the synthesis of seven and five such proposition then can not be term axiom for in that case we should have an infinity of these but numerical formula this transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomenon greatly enlarge our a priori cognition for it be by this principle alone that pure mathematics be render applicable in all it precision to object of experience and without it the validity of this application would not be so selfevident on the contrary contradiction and confusion have often arise on this very point phenomenon be not thing in themselves empirical intuition be possible only through pure intuition of space and time consequently what geometry affirms of the latter be indisputably valid of the former all evasion such a the statement that object of sense do not conform to the rule of construction in space for example to the rule of the infinite divisibility of line or angle must fall to the ground for if these objection hold good we deny to space and with it to all mathematics objective validity and nolonger know wherefore and how far mathematics can be apply to phenomena the synthesis of space and time a the essential form of all intuition be that which render possible the apprehension of a phenomenon and therefore every external experience consequently all cognition of the object of experience and whatever mathematics in it pure use prof of the former must necessarily hold good of the latter all objection be but the chicanery of an illinstructed reason which erroneously think to liberate the object of sense from the formal condition of our sensibility and represent these although mere phenomena a thing in themselves present a such to our understand but in this case noa priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible consequently not through pure conception of space and the science which determine these conception that be to say geometry would itself be impossible anticipation of perception the principle of these be in all phenomena the real that which be an object of sensation have intensive quantity that be have a degree proof perception be empirical consciousness that be to say a consciousness which contain an element of sensation phenomenon a object of perception be not pure that be merely formal intuition like space and time for they can not be perceive in themselves footnote they can be perceive only a phenomenon and some part of them must always belong to the nonego whereas pure intuition be entirely the product of the mind itself and a such be coguized in themselvestr they contain then over and above the intuition the material for an object through which be represent something exist in space or time that be to say they contain the real of sensation a a representation merely subjective which give u merely the consciousness that the subject be affect and which we refer to some external object now a gradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness be possible inasmuch a the real in this consciousness entirely vanishes and there remain a merely formal consciousness a priori of the manifold in time and space consequently there be possible a synthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation from it commencement that be from the pure intuition = onwards up to a certain quantity of the sensation now a sensation in itself be not an objective representation and in it be to be find neither the intuition of space nor of time it can not possess any extensive quantity and yet there do belong to it a quantity and that by mean of it apprehension in which empirical consciousness can within a certain time rise from nothing = up to it give amount consequently an intensive quantity and thus we must ascribe intensive quantity that be a degree of influence on sense to all object of perception in so far a this perception contain sensation all cognition by mean of which i be enable to cognize and determine a priori what belong to empirical cognition may be call an anticipation and without doubt this be the sense in which epicurus employ hi expression prholepsis but a there be in phenomenon something which be never cognize a priori which on this account constitute the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition that be to say sensation a the matter of perception it follow that sensation be just that element in cognition which can not be at all anticipate on the other hand we might very well term the pure determination in space and time as well in regard to figure a to quantity anticipation of phenomenon because they represent a priori that which may always be give a posteriori in experience but suppose that in every sensation a sensation in general without any particular sensation be think of there exist something which could be cognize a priori this would deserve to be call anticipation in a special sensespecial because it may seem surprise to forestall experience in that which concern the matter of experience and which we can only derive from itself yet such really be the case here apprehension by mean of sensation alone fill only one moment that be if i do not take into consideration a succession of many sensation a that in the phenomenon the apprehension of which be not a successive synthesis advance from part to an entire representation sensation have therefore noextensive quantity the want of sensation in a moment of time would represent it a empty consequently = that which in the empirical intuition corresponds to sensation be reality realitas phaenomenon that which correspond to the absence of it negation = now every sensation be capable of a diminution so that it can decrease and thus gradually disappear therefore between reality in a phenomenon and negation there exist a continuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensation the difference of which from each other be always small than that between the give sensation and zero or complete negation that be to say the real in a phenomenon have always a quantity which however be not discoverable in apprehension inasmuch a apprehension take place by mean of mere sensation in one instant and not by the successive synthesis of many sensation and therefore do not progress from part to the whole consequently it have a quantity but not an extensive quantity now that quantity which be apprehend only a unity and in which plurality can be represent only by approximation to negation = o i term intensive quantity consequently reality in a phenomenon have intensive quantity that be a degree if we consider this reality a cause be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon for example a change we call the degree of reality in it character of cause a momentum for example the momentum of weight and for this reason that the degree only indicate that quantity the apprehension of which be not successive but instantaneous this however i touch upon only in pass for with causality i have at present nothing to do accordingly every sensation consequently every reality in phenomena however small it may be have a degree that be an intensive quantity which may always be lessen and between reality and negation there exist a continuous connection of possible reality and possible small perception every colourfor example redhas a degree which be it ever so small be never the small and so be it always with heat the momentum of weight etc this property of quantity accord to which nopart of them be the small possible nopart simple be call their continuity space and time be quanta continuum because nopart of them can be give without enclose it within boundary point and moment consequently this give part be itself a space or a time space therefore consist only of space and time of time point and moment be only boundary that be the mere place or position of their limitation but place always presuppose intuition which be to limit or determine them and we can not conceive either space or time compose of constituent part which be give before space or time such quantity may also be call flowing because synthesis of the productive imagination in the production of these quantity be a progression in time the continuity of which we be accustom to indicate by the expression flow all phenomenon then be continuous quantity in respect both to intuition and mere perception sensation and with it reality in the former case they be extensive quantity in the latter intensive when the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon be interrupt there result merely an aggregate of several phenomenon and not properly a phenomenon a a quantity which be not produce by the mere continuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind but by the repetition of a synthesis always cease for example if i call thirteen dollar a sum or quantity of money i employ the term quite correctly inasmuch a i understand by thirteen dollar the value of a mark in standard silver which be to be sure a continuous quantity in which nopart be the small but every part might constitute a piece of money which would contain material for still small piece if however by the word thirteen dollar i understand so many coin be their value in silver what it may it would be quite erroneous to use the expression a quantity of dollar on the contrary i must call them aggregate that be a number of coin and a in every number we must have unity a the foundation so a phenomenon take a unity be a quantity and a such always a continuous quantity quantum continuum now see all phenomenon whether consider a extensive or intensive be continuous quantity the proposition all change transition of a thing from one state into another be continuous might be prove here easily and with mathematical evidence be it not that the causality of a change lie entirely beyond the bound of a transcendental philosophy and presuppose empirical principle for of the possibility of a cause which change the condition of thing that be which determine them to the contrary to a certain give state the understanding give u a priori noknowledge not merely because it have noinsight into the possibility of it for such insight be absent in several a priori cognition but because the notion of change concern only certain determination of phenomenon which experience alone can acquaint u with while their cause lie in the unchangeable but see that we have nothing which we could here employ but the pure fundamental conception of all possible experience among which of course nothing empirical can be admit we dare not without injure the unity of our system anticipate general physical science which be build upon certain fundamental experience nevertheless we be in nowant of proof of the great influence which the principle above develop exercise in the anticipation of perception and even in supply the want of them so far a to shield u against the false conclusion which otherwise we might rashly draw if all reality in perception have a degree between which and negation there be an endless sequence of ever small degree and if nevertheless every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity for sensation noperception and consequently noexperience be possible which can prove either immediately or mediately an entire absence of all reality in a phenomenon in other word it be impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of empty space or of empty time for in the first place an entire absence of reality in a sensuous intuition can not of course be an object of perception secondly such absence can not be deduce from the contemplation of any single phenomenon and the difference of the degree in it reality nor ought it ever to be admit in explanation of any phenomenon for if even the complete intuition of a determinate space or time be thoroughly real that be if nopart thereof be empty yet because every reality have it degree which with the extensive quantity of the phenomenon unchanged can diminish through endless gradation down to nothing the void there must be infinitely graduate degree with which space or time be fill and the intensive quantity in different phenomenon may be small or great although the extensive quantity of the intuition remain equal and unaltered we shall give an example of this almost all natural philosopher remark a great difference in the quantity of the matter of different kind in body with the same volume partly on account of the momentum of gravity or weight partly on account of the momentum of resistance to other body in motion conclude unanimously that this volume extensive quantity of the phenomenon must be void in all body although in different proportion but who would suspect that these for the most part mathematical and mechanical inquirer into nature should grind this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesisa sort of hypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid yet this they do in assume that the real in space i must not here call it impenetrability or weight because these be empirical conception be always identical and can only be distinguish accord to it extensive quantity that be multiplicity now to this presupposition for which they can have noground in experience and which consequently be merely metaphysical i oppose a transcendental demonstration which it be true will not explain the difference in the fill up of space but which nevertheless completely do away with the suppose necessity of the abovementioned presupposition that we can not explain the say difference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty space this demonstration moreover have the merit of set the understanding at liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner if the explanation of the fact require any such hypothesis for we perceive that although two equal space may be completely fill by matter altogether different so that in neither of them be there leave a single point wherein matter be not present nevertheless every reality have it degree of resistance or of weight which without diminution of the extensive quantity can become less and less ad infinitum before it pass into nothingness and disappear thus an expansion which fill a spacefor example caloric or any other reality in the phenomenal worldcan decrease in it degree to infinity yet without leave the small part of the space empty on the contrary filling it with those less degree as completely a another phenomenon could with great my intention here be by nomean to maintain that this be really the case with the difference of matter in regard to their specific gravity i wish only to prove from a principle of the pure understanding that the nature of our perception make such a mode of explanation possible and that it be erroneous to regard the real in a phenomenon a equal quoad it degree and different only quoad it aggregation and extensive quantity and this too on the pretended authority of an a priori principle of the understanding nevertheless this principle of the anticipation of perception must somewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental philosophy have render cautious we must naturally entertain some doubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such synthetical proposition a that respect the degree of all reality in phenomenon and consequently the possibility of the internal difference of sensation itselfabstraction be make of it empirical quality thus it be a question not unworthy of solution how the understanding can pronounce synthetically and a priori respecting phenomenon and thus anticipate these even in that which be peculiarly and merely empirical that namely which concern sensation itself the quality of sensation be in all case merely empirical and can not be represent a priori for example colour taste etc but the realthat which correspond to sensationin opposition to negation = only represent something the conception of which in itself contain a be ein seyn and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical consciousness that be to say the empirical consciousness in the internal sense can be raise from to every high degree so that the very same extensive quantity of intuition an illuminated surface for example excites a great a sensation a an aggregate of many other surface less illuminated we can therefore make complete abstraction of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon and represent to ourselves in the mere sensation in a certain momentum a synthesis of homogeneous ascension from up to the give empirical consciousness all sensation therefore a such be give only a posteriori but this property thereof namely that they have a degree can be know a priori it be worthy of remark that in respect to quantity in general we can cognize a priori only a single quality namely continuity but in respect to all quality the real in phenomenon we can not cognize a priori anything more than the intensive quantity thereof namely that they have a degree all els be leave to experience analogy of experience the principle of these be experience be possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perception proof experience be an empirical cognition that be to say a cognition which determine an object by mean of perception it be therefore a synthesis of perception a synthesis which be not itself contain in perception but which contain the synthetical unity of the manifold of perception in a consciousness and this unity constitute the essential of our cognition of object of the sens that be of experience not merely of intuition or sensation now in experience our perception come together contingently so that nocharacter of necessity in their connection appear or can appear from the perception themselves because apprehension be only a place together of the manifold of empirical intuition and norepresentation of a necessity in the connected existence of the phenomenon which apprehension bring together be to be discover therein but a experience be a cognition of object by mean of perception it follow that the relation of the existence of the existence of the manifold must be represent in experience not a it be put together in time but a it be objectively in time and a time itself can not be perceive the determination of the existence of object in time can only take place by mean of their connection in time in general consequently only by mean of a priori connecting conception now a these conception always possess the character of necessity experience be possible only by mean of a representation of the necessary connection of perception the three modi of time be permanence succession and coexistence accordingly there be three rule of all relation of time in phenomenon accord to which the existence of every phenomenon be determine in respect of the unity of all time and these antecede all experience and render it possible the general principle of all three analogy rest on the necessary unity of apperception in relation to all possible empirical consciousness perception at every time consequently a this unity lie a priori at the foundation of all mental operation the principle rest on the synthetical unity of all phenomenon accord to their relation in time for the original apperception relate to our internal sense the complex of all representation and indeed relate a priori to it form that be to say the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in time now this manifold must be combine in original apperception accord to relation of timea necessity impose by the a priori transcendental unity of apperception to which be subject all that can belong to my ie my own cognition and therefore all that can become an object for me this synthetical and a priori determine unity in relation of perception in time be therefore the rule all empirical determination of time must be subject to rule of the general determination of time and the analogy of experience of which we be now about to treat must be rule of this nature these principle have this peculiarity that they do not concern phenomenon and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof but merely the existence of phenomenon and their relation to each other in regard to this existence now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determine a priori in such a manner that the rule of it synthesis can give that be to say can produce this a priori intuition in every empirical example but the existence of phenomenon can not be know a priori and although we could arrive by this path at a conclusion of the fact of some existence we could not cognize that existence determinately that be to say we should be incapable of anticipate in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be distinguishable from that of other the two principle above mention which i call mathematical in consideration of the fact of their authorize the application of mathematic phenomenon relate to these phenomenon only in regard to their possibility and instruct u how phenomena as far a regard their intuition or the real in their perception can be generate accord to the rule of a mathematical synthesis consequently numerical quantity and with them the determination of a phenomenon a a quantity can be employ in the one case as well a in the other thus for example out of illumination by the moon i might compose and give a priori that be construct the degree of our sensation of the sunlight we may therefore entitle these two principle constitutive footnote kant meaning be the two principle enunciate under the head of axiom of intuition and anticipation of perception authorize the application to phenomena of determination of size and number that be of mathematic for example i may compute the light of the sun and say that it quantity be a certain number of time great than that of the moon in the same way heat be measure by the comparison of it different effect on water c and on mercury in a thermometertr the case be very different with those principle whose province it be to subject the existence of phenomenon to rule a priori for a existence do not admit of be construct it be clear that they must only concern the relation of existence and be merely regulative principle in this case therefore neither axiom nor anticipation be to be think of thus if a perception be give u in a certain relation of time to other although undetermined perception we can not then say a priori what and how great in quantity the other perception necessarily connect with the former be but only how it be connect quoad it existence in this give modus of time analogy in philosophy mean something very different from that which they represent in mathematics in the latter they be formulae which enounce the equality of two relation of quantity and be always constitutive so that if two term of the proportion be give the third be also give that be can be construct by the aid of these formula but in philosophy analogy be not the equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relation in this case from three give term i can give a priori and cognize the relation to a fourth member but not this fourth term itself although i certainly possess a rule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience and a mark to assist me in discover it an analogy of experience be therefore only a rule accord to which unity of experience must arise out of perception in respect to object phenomena not a a constitutive but merely a a regulative principle the same hold good also of the postulate of empirical thought in general which relate to the synthesis of mere intuition which concern the form of phenomenon the synthesis of perception which concern the matter of phenomenon and the synthesis of experience which concern the relation of these perception for they be only regulative principle and clearly distinguishable from the mathematical which be constitutive not indeed in regard to the certainty which both posse a priori but in the mode of evidence thereof consequently also in the manner of demonstration but what have be observe of all synthetical proposition and must be particularly remark in this place be this that these analogy possess significance and validity not a principle of the transcendental but only a principle of the empirical use of the understanding and their truth can therefore be prove only a such and that consequently the phenomenon must not be subjoin directly under the category but only under their schema for if the object to which those principle must be apply be thing in themselves it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concern them synthetically a priori but they be nothing but phenomena a complete knowledge of whicha knowledge to which all principles a priori must at last relateis the only possible experience it follow that these principle can have nothing els for their aim than the condition of the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomenon but this synthesis be cogitate only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding of whose unity a that of a synthesis in general the category contain the function unrestricted by any sensuous condition these principle will therefore authorize u to connect phenomena accord to an analogy with the logical and universal unity of conception and consequently to employ the category in the principle themselves but in the application of them to experience we shall use only their schema a the key to their proper application instead of the category or rather the latter a restrict condition under the title of formula of the former a first analogy principle of the permanence of substance in all change of phenomenon substance be permanent and the quantum thereof in nature be neither increase nor diminish proof all phenomena exist in time wherein alone a substratum that be a the permanent form of the internal intuition coexistence and succession can be represent consequently time in which all change of phenomenon must be cogitate remains and change not because it be that in which succession and coexistence can be represent only a determination thereof now time in itself can not be an object of perception it follow that in object of perception that be in phenomenon there must be find a substratum which represent time in general and in which all change or coexistence can be perceive by mean of the relation of phenomenon to it but the substratum of all reality that be of all that pertain to the existence of thing be substance all that pertain to existence can be cogitate only a a determination of substance consequently the permanent in relation to which alone can all relation of time in phenomenon be determine be substance in the world of phenomenon that be the real in phenomenon that which a the substratum of all change remain ever the same accordingly a this can not change in existence it quantity in nature can neither be increase nor diminish our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always successive be consequently always change by it alone we could therefore never determine whether this manifold a an object of experience be coexistent or successive unless it have for a foundation something fix and permanent of the existence of which all succession and coexistence be nothing but so many mode modi of time only in the permanent then be relation of time possible for simultaneity and succession be the only relation in time that be to say the permanent be the substratum of our empirical representation of time itself in which alone all determination of time be possible permanence be in fact just another expression for time a the abide correlate of all existence of phenomenon and of all change and of all coexistence for change do not affect time itself but only the phenomenon in time just a coexistence can not be regard a a modus of time itself see that in time nopart be coexistent but all successive if we be to attribute succession to time itself we should be oblige to cogitate another time in which this succession would be possible it be only by mean of the permanent that existence in different part of the successive series of time receive a quantity which we entitle duration for in mere succession existence be perpetually vanishing and recommence and therefore never have even the least quantity without the permanent then norelation in time be possible now time in itself be not an object of perception consequently the permanent in phenomenon must be regard a the substratum of all determination of time and consequently also a the condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perception that be of experience and all existence and all change in time can only be regard a a mode in the existence of i find that in all age not only the philosopher but even the common understanding have preposited this permanence a a substratum of all change in phenomena indeed i be compel to believe that they will always accept this a an indubitable fact only the philosopher express himself in a more precise and definite manner when he say in all change in the world the substance remain and the accident alone be changeable but of this decidedly synthetical proposition i nowhere meet with even an attempt at proof nay it very rarely have the good fortune to stand a it deserve to do at the head of the pure and entirely a priori law of nature in truth the statement that substance be permanent be tautological for this very permanence be the ground on which we apply the category of substance to the phenomenon and we should have be oblige to prove that in all phenomenon there be something permanent of the existence of which the changeable be nothing but a determination but because a proof of this nature can not be dogmatical that be can not be draw from conception inasmuch a it concern a synthetical proposition a priori and a philosopher never reflect that such proposition be valid only in relation to possible experience and therefore can not be prove except by mean of a deduction of the possibility of experience it be no
