chapter ii concerning hereditary principality i will leave out all discussion on republic inasmuch a in another place i have write of them at length and will address myself only to principality in do so i will keep to the order indicate above and discuss how such principality be to be rule and preserve i say at once there be few difficulty in hold hereditary state and those long accustomed to the family of their prince than new one for it be sufficient only not to transgress the custom of hi ancestor and to deal prudently with circumstance a they arise for a prince of average power to maintain himself in hi state unless he be deprive of it by some extraordinary and excessive force and if he should be so deprive of it whenever anything sinister happen to the usurper he will regain it we have in italy for example the duke of ferrara who could not have withstood the attack of the venetian in nor those of pope julius in unless he have be long establish in hi dominion for the hereditary prince have less cause and less necessity to offend hence it happen that he will be more loved and unless extraordinary vice cause him to be hat it be reasonable to expect that hi subject will be naturally well disposed towards him and in the antiquity and duration of hi rule the memory and motif that make for change be lose for one change always leave the tooth for another chapter iii concerning mixed principality but the difficulty occur in a new principality and firstly if it be not entirely new but be a it be a member of a state which take collectively may be call composite the change arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there be in all new principality for men change their ruler willingly hop to better themselves and this hope induce them to take up arm against him who rule wherein they be deceive because they afterwards find by experience they have go from bad to worse this follow also on another natural and common necessity which always cause a new prince to burden those who have submit to him with hi soldiery and with infinite other hardship which he must put upon hi new acquisition in this way you have enemy in all those whom you have injure in seize that principality and you be not able to keep those friend who put you there because of your not be able to satisfy them in the way they expect and you can not take strong measure against them feel bound to them for although one may be very strong in armed force yet in enter a province one have always need of the goodwill of the native for these reason louis the twelfth king of france quickly occupy milan and a quickly lose it and to turn him out the first time it only need lodovicos own force because those who have open the gate to him find themselves deceive in their hope of future benefit would not endure the illtreatment of the new prince it be very true that after acquire rebellious province a second time they be not so lightly lose afterwards because the prince with little reluctance take the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquent to clear out the suspect and to strengthen himself in the weak place thus to cause france to lose milan the first time it be enough for the duke lodovicoto raise insurrection on the border but to cause him to lose it a second time it be necessary to bring the whole world against him and that hi army should be defeat and drive out of italy which follow from the cause above mention duke lodovico be lodovico moro a son of francesco sforza who marry beatrice dest he rule over milan from to and die in nevertheless milan be take from france both the first and the second time the general reason for the first have be discuss it remain to name those for the second and to see what resource he have and what any one in hi situation would have have for maintain himself more securely in hi acquisition than do the king of france now i say that those dominion which when acquire be add to an ancient state by him who acquire them be either of the same country and language or they be not when they be it be easy to hold them especially when they have not be accustom to self government and to hold them securely it be enough to have destroy the family of the prince who be rule them because the two people preserve in other thing the old condition and not be unlike in custom will live quietly together a one have see in brittany burgundy gascony and normandy which have be bind to france for so long a time and although there may be some difference in language nevertheless the custom be alike and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves he who have annex them if he wish to hold them have only to bear in mind two consideration the one that the family of their former lord be extinguish the other that neither their law nor their tax be alter so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality but when state be acquire in a country differ in language custom or law there be difficulty and good fortune and great energy be need to hold them and one of the great and most real help would be that he who have acquire them should go and reside there this would make hi position more secure and durable a it have make that of the turk in greece who notwithstanding all the other measure take by him for hold that state if he have not settle there would not have be able to keep it because if one be on the spot disorder be see a they spring up and one can quickly remedy them but if one be not at hand they be hear of only when they be great and then one can no longer remedy them besides this the country be not pillage by your official the subject be satisfy by prompt recourse to the prince thus wish to be good they have more cause to love him and wish to be otherwise to fear him he who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution as long a the prince reside there it can only be wrest from him with the great difficulty the other and good course be to send colony to one or two place which may be a key to that state for it be necessary either to do this or els to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry a prince do not spend much on colony for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there and he offend a minority only of the citizen from whom he take land and house to give them to the new inhabitant and those whom he offend remain poor and scatter be never able to injure him whilst the rest be uninjured be easily keep quiet and at the same time be anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them a it have to those who have be despoil in conclusion i say that these colony be not costly they be more faithful they injure less and the injure a have be say be poor and scatter can not hurt upon this one have to remark that men ought either to be well treat or crush because they can avenge themselves of light injury of more serious one they can not therefore the injury that be to be do to a man ought to be of such a kind that one do not stand in fear of revenge but in maintain arm men there in place of colony one spend much more have to consume on the garrison all the income from the state so that the acquisition turn into a loss and many more be exasperate because the whole state be injure through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquaint with hardship and all become hostile and they be enemy who whilst beat on their own ground be yet able to do hurt for every reason therefore such guard be as useless a a colony be useful again the prince who hold a country differ in the above respect ought to make himself the head and defender of hi le powerful neighbour and to weaken the more powerful amongst them take care that no foreigner as powerful a himself shall by any accident get a footing there for it will always happen that such a one will be introduce by those who be discontent either through excess of ambition or through fear a one have see already the roman be bring into greece by the aetolians and in every other country where they obtain a footing they be bring in by the inhabitant and the usual course of affair be that as soon a a powerful foreigner enters a country all the subject state be draw to him move by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power so that in respect to those subject state he have not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he have acquire there he have only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority and then with hi own force and with their goodwill he can easily keep down the more powerful of them so a to remain entirely master in the country and he who do not properly manage this business will soon lose what he have acquire and whilst he do hold it he will have endless difficulty and trouble the roman in the country which they annex observe closely these measure they send colony and maintain friendly relation withthe minor power without increase their strength they keep down the great and do not allow any strong foreign power to gain authority greece appear to me sufficient for an example the achaean and aetolians be keep friendly by them the kingdom of macedonia be humble antiochus be drive out yet the merit of the achaean and aetolians never secure for them permission to increase their power nor do the persuasion of philip ever induce the roman to be hi friend without first humble him nor do the influence of antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country because the roman do in these instance what all prudent prince ought to do who have to regard not only present trouble but also future one for which they must prepare with every energy because when foreseen it be easy to remedy them but if you wait until they approach the medicine be no longer in time because the malady have become incurable for it happen in this a the physician say it happen in hectic fever that in the beginning of the malady it be easy to cure but difficult to detect but in the course of time not have be either detect or treat in the beginning it become easy to detect but difficult to cure this it happen in affair of state for when the evil that arise have be foreseen which it be only give to a wise man to see they can be quickly redress but when through not have be foreseen they have be permit to grow in a way that every one can see them there be no longer a remedy therefore the roman foreseeing trouble deal with them at once and even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head for they know that war be not to be avoid but be only to be put off to the advantage of other moreover they wish to fight with philip and antiochus in greece so a not to have to do it in italy they could have avoid both but this they do not wish nor do that ever please them which be for ever in the mouth of the wise one of our timelet u enjoy the benefit of the timebut rather the benefit of their own valour and prudence for time drive everything before it and be able to bring with it good as well a evil and evil as well a good see remark in the introduction on the word intrattenere but let u turn to france and inquire whether she have do any of the thing mention i will speak of louisand not of charles+ a the one whose conduct be the good to be observe he have hold possession of italy for the long period and you will see that he have do the opposite to those thing which ought to be do to retain a state compose of diver element louis xii king of france the father of the people bear die charles viii king of france born die king louis be bring into italy by the ambition of the venetian who desire to obtain half the state of lombardy by hi intervention i will not blame the course take by the king because wish to get a foothold in italy and have no friend thereseeing rather that every door be shut to him owe to the conduct of charleshe be force to accept those friendship which he could get and he would have succeed very quickly in hi design if in other matter he have not make some mistake the king however have acquire lombardy regain at once the authority which charles have lose genoa yield the florentine become hi friend the marquess of mantua the duke of ferrara the bentivogli my lady of forli the lord of faenza of pesaro of rimini of camerino of piombino the lucchese the pisans the sieneseeverybody make advance to him to become hi friend then could the venetian realize the rashness of the course take by them which in order that they might secure two town in lombardy have make the king master of twothirds of italy let any one now consider with that little difficulty the king could have maintain hi position in italy have he observe the rule above lay down and keep all hi friend secure and protect for although they be numerous they be both weak and timid some afraid of the church some of the venetian and thus they would always have be force to stand in with him and by their mean he could easily have make himself secure against those who remain powerful but he be no sooner in milan than he do the contrary by assist pope alexander to occupy the romagna it never occur to him that by this action he be weaken himself deprive himself of friend and of those who have throw themselves into hi lap whilst he aggrandize the church by add much temporal power to the spiritual thus give it great authority and have commit this prime error he be oblige to follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambition of alexander and to prevent hi become the master of tuscany he be himself force to come into italy and a if it be not enough to have aggrandize the church and deprive himself of friend he wish to have the kingdom of naples divide it with the king of spain and where he be the prime arbiter in italy he take an associate so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontent of hi own should have somewhere to shelter and whereas he could have leave in the kingdom hi own pensioner a king he drive him out to put one there who be able to drive him louis out in turn the wish to acquire be in truth very natural and common and men always do so when they can and for this they will be praise not blame but when they can not do so yet wish to do so by any mean then there be folly and blame therefore if france could have attack naples with her own force she ought to have do so if she could not then she ought not to have divide it and if the partition which she make with the venetian in lombardy be justify by the excuse that by it she get a foothold in italy this other partition merit blame for it have not the excuse of that necessity therefore louis make these five error he destroy the minor power he increase the strength of one of the great power in italy he bring in a foreign power he do not settle in the country he do not send colony which error have he live be not enough to injure him have he not make a sixth by take away their dominion from the venetian because have he not aggrandize the church nor bring spain into italy it would have be very reasonable and necessary to humble them but have first take these step he ought never to have consent to their ruin for they be powerful would always have keep off other from design on lombardy to which the venetian would never have consent except to become master themselves there also because the other would not wish to take lombardy from france in order to give it to the venetian and to run counter to both they would not have have the courage and if any one should say king louis yield the romagna to alexander and the kingdom to spain to avoid war i answer for the reason give above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrate to avoid war because it be not to be avoid but be only deferred to your disadvantage and if another should allege the pledge which the king have give to the pope that he would assist him in the enterprise in exchange for the dissolution of hi marriageand for the cap to rouento that i reply what i shall write later on concern the faith of prince and how it ought to be keep louis xii divorce hi wife jeanne daughter of louis xi and marry in anne of brittany widow of charles viii in order to retain the duchy of brittany for the crown the archbishop of rouen he be george damboise create a cardinal by alexander vi born die thus king louis lose lombardy by not have follow any of the condition observe by those who have take possession of country and wish to retain them nor be there any miracle in this but much that be reasonable and quite natural and on these matter i speak at nantes with rouen when valentino a cesare borgia the son of pope alexander be usually call occupy the romagna and on cardinal rouen observe to me that the italian do not understand war i reply to him that the french do not understand statecraft meaning that otherwise they would not have allow the church to reach such greatness and in fact be have be see that the greatness of the church and of spain in italy have be cause by france and her ruin may be attribute to them from this a general rule be draw which never or rarely fail that he who be the cause of another become powerful be ruin because that predominancy have be bring about either by astuteness or els by force and both be distrust by him who have be raise to power chapter iv why the kingdom of darius conquered by alexander did not rebel against the successor of alexander at hi death considering the difficulty which men have have to hold to a newly acquire state some might wonder how seeing that alexander the great become the master of asia in a few year and die whilst it be scarcely settle whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebel nevertheless hi successor maintain themselves and have to meet no other difficulty than that which arise among themselves from their own ambition i answer that the principality of which one have record be find to be govern in two different way either by a prince with a body of servant who assist him to govern the kingdom a minister by hi favour and permission or by a prince and baron who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince such baron have state and their own subject who recognize them a lord and hold them in natural affection those state that be govern by a prince and hi servant hold their prince in more consideration because in all the country there be no one who be recognize a superior to him and if they yield obedience to another they do it a to a minister and official and they do not bear him any particular affection the example of these two government in our time be the turk and the king of france the entire monarchy of the turk be govern by one lord the other be hi servant and divide hi kingdom into sanjaks he send there different administrator and shift and change them a he choose but the king of france be place in the midst of an ancient body of lord acknowledge by their own subject and beloved by them they have their own prerogative nor can the king take these away except at hi peril therefore he who consider both of these state will recognize great difficulty in seize the state of the turk but once it be conquer great ease in hold it the cause of the difficulty in seize the kingdom of the turk be that the usurper can not be call in by the prince of the kingdom nor can he hope to be assist in hi design by the revolt of those whom the lord have around him this arise from the reason give above for hi minister be all slave and bondman can only be corrupt with great difficulty and one can expect little advantage from them when they have be corrupt a they can not carry the people with them for the reason assign hence he who attack the turk must bear in mind that he will find him united and he will have to rely more on hi own strength than on the revolt of other but if once the turk have be conquer and rout in the field in such a way that he can not replace hi army there be nothing to fear but the family of this prince and this be exterminate there remain no one to fear the other have no credit with the people and a the conqueror do not rely on them before hi victory so he ought not to fear them after it the contrary happens in kingdom govern like that of france because one can easily enter there by gain over some baron of the kingdom for one always find malcontent and such a desire a change such men for the reason give can open the way into the state and render the victory easy but if you wish to hold it afterwards you meet with infinite difficulty both from those who have assist you and from those you have crush nor be it enough for you to have exterminate the family of the prince because the lord that remain make themselves the head of fresh movement against you and a you be unable either to satisfy or exterminate them that state be lose whenever time bring the opportunity now if you will consider what be the nature of the government of darius you will find it similar to the kingdom of the turk and therefore it be only necessary for alexander first to overthrow him in the field and then to take the country from him after which victory darius be kill the state remain secure to alexander for the above reason and if hi successor have be unite they would have enjoy it securely and at their ease for there be no tumult raise in the kingdom except those they provoke themselves but it be impossible to hold with such tranquillity state constitute like that of france hence arise those frequent rebellion against the roman in spain france and greece owe to the many principality there be in these state of which as long a the memory of them endure the roman always hold an insecure possession but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them pass away and the roman then become secure possessor and when fight afterwards amongst themselves each one be able to attach to himself hi own part of the country accord to the authority he have assume there and the family of the former lord be exterminate none other than the roman be acknowledge when these thing be remember no one will marvel at the ease with which alexander hold the empire of asia or at the difficulty which other have have to keep an acquisition such a pyrrhus and many more this be not occasion by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror but by the want of uniformity in the subject state chapter v concerning the way to govern city or principality which lived under their own law before they were annexed whenever those state which have be acquire a state have be accustom to live under their own law and in freedom there be three course for those who wish to hold them the first be to ruin them the next be to reside there in person the third be to permit them to live under their own law draw a tribute and establish within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you because such a government be create by the prince know that it can not stand without hi friendship and interest and do it utmost to support him and therefore he who would keep a city accustom to freedom will hold it more easily by the mean of it own citizen than in any other way there be for example the spartan and the roman the spartan hold athens and thebe establish there an oligarchy nevertheless they lose them the roman in order to hold capua carthage and numantia dismantle them and do not lose them they wish to hold greece a the spartan hold it make it free and permit it law and do not succeed so to hold it they be compel to dismantle many city in the country for in truth there be no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruin them and he who become master of a city accustom to freedom and do not destroy it may expect to be destroy by it for in rebellion it have always the watchword of liberty and it ancient privilege a a rallying point which neither time nor benefit will ever cause it to forget and whatever you may do or provide against they never forget that name or their privilege unless they be disunite or disperse but at every chance they immediately rally to them a pisa after the hundred year she have be hold in bondage by the florentine but when city or country be accustom to live under a prince and hi family be exterminate they be on the one hand accustom to obey and on the other hand not have the old prince can not agree in make one from amongst themselves and they do not know how to govern themselves for this reason they be very slow to take up arm and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily but in republic there be more vitality great hatred and more desire for vengeance which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest so that the safe way be to destroy them or to reside there chapter vi concerning new principality which are acquired by one own arm and ability let no one be surprise if in speaking of entirely new principality a i shall do i adduce the high example both of prince and of state because men walk almost always in path beat by other and follow by imitation their deed be yet unable to keep entirely to the way of other or attain to the power of those they imitate a wise man ought always to follow the path beat by great men and to imitate those who have be supreme so that if hi ability do not equal theirs at least it will savour of it let him act like the clever archer who design to hit the mark which yet appear too far distant and know the limit to which the strength of their bow attains take aim much high than the mark not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach i say therefore that in entirely new principality where there be a new prince more or less difficulty be find in keep them accordingly a there be more or less ability in him who have acquire the state now a the fact of become a prince from a private station presuppose either ability or fortune it be clear that one or other of these thing will mitigate in some degree many difficulty nevertheless he who have rely least on fortune be establish the strong further it facilitate matter when the prince have no other state be compel to reside there in person but to come to those who by their own ability and not through fortune have rise to be prince i say that moses cyrus romulus theseus and such like be the most excellent example and although one may not discuss moses he have be a mere executor of the will of god yet he ought to be admire if only for that favour which make him worthy to speak with god but in consider cyrus and other who have acquire or found kingdom all will be find admirable and if their particular deed and conduct shall be consider they will not be find inferior to those of moses although he have so great a preceptor and in examine their action and live one can not see that they owe anything to fortune beyond opportunity which bring them the material to mould into the form which seem best to them without that opportunity their power of mind would have be extinguish and without those power the opportunity would have come in vain it be necessary therefore to moses that he should find the people of israel in egypt enslave and oppress by the egyptian in order that they should be dispose to follow him so a to be deliver out of bondage it be necessary that romulus should not remain in alba and that he should be abandon at hi birth in order that he should become king of romeand founder of the fatherland it be necessary that cyrus should find the persian discontent with the government of the medes and the medes soft and effeminate through their long peace theseus could not have show hi ability have he not find the athenian disperse these opportunity therefore make those men fortunate and their high ability enable them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country be ennoble and make famous those who by valorous way become prince like these men acquire a principality with difficulty but they keep it with ease the difficulty they have in acquire it rise in part from the new rule and method which they be force to introduce to establish their government and it security and it ought to be remember that there be nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in it success then to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of thing because the innovator have for enemy all those who have do well under the old condition and lukewarm defender in those who may do well under the new this coolness arise partly from fear of the opponent who have the law on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new thing until they have have a long experience of them thus it happen that whenever those who be hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisan whilst the other defend lukewarmly in such wise that the prince be endanger along with them it be necessary therefore if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly to inquire whether these innovator can rely on themselves or have to depend on other that be to say whether to consummate their enterprise have they to use prayer or can they use force in the first instance they always succeed badly and never compass anything but when they can rely on themselves and use force then they be rarely endanger hence it be that all arm prophet have conquer and the unarmed one have be destroy besides the reason mention the nature of the people be variable and whilst it be easy to persuade them it be difficult to fix them in that persuasion and thus it be necessary to take such measure that when they believe no long it may be possible to make them believe by force if moses cyrus theseus and romulus have be unarm they could not have enforce their constitution for longas happen in our time to fra girolamo savonarola who be ruin with hi new order of thing immediately the multitude believe in him no longer and he have no mean of keep steadfast those who believe or of make the unbeliever to believe therefore such a these have great difficulty in consummate their enterprise for all their danger be in the ascent yet with ability they will overcome them but when these be overcome and those who envy them their success be exterminate they will begin to be respect and they will continue afterwards powerful secure honour and happy to these great example i wish to add a less one still it bear some resemblance to them and i wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind it be hiero the syracusanthis man rise from a private station to be prince of syracuse nor do he either owe anything to fortune but opportunity for the syracusans be oppress choose him for their captain afterwards he be reward by be make their prince he be of so great ability even a a private citizen that one who write of him say he want nothing but a kingdom to be a king this man abolish the old soldiery organize the new give up old alliance make new one and a he have hi own soldier and ally on such foundation he be able to build any edifice thus whilst he have endure much trouble in acquire he have but little in keep hiero ii bear about bc die bc chapter vii concerning new principality which are acquired either by the arm of other or by good fortune those who solely by good fortune become prince from be private citizen have little trouble in rise but much in keep atop they have not any difficulty on the way up because they fly but they have many when they reach the summit such be those to whom some state be give either for money or by the favour of him who bestow it a happen to many in greece in the city of ionia and of the hellespont where prince be make by darius in order that they might hold the city both for hi security and hi glory a also be those emperor who by the corruption of the soldier from be citizen come to empire such stand simply elevate upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who have elevate themtwo most inconstant and unstable thing neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position because unless they be men of great worth and ability it be not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command have always live in a private condition besides they can not hold it because they have not force which they can keep friendly and faithful state that rise unexpectedly then like all other thing in nature which be bear and grow rapidly can not leave their foundation and correspondenciesfixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them unless a be say those who unexpectedly become prince be men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepare at once to hold that which fortune have throw into their lap and that those foundation which other have lay before they become prince they must lay afterwards le radici e corrispondenze their root ie foundation and correspond or relation with other statesa common meaning of correspondence and correspond in the sixteenth and seventeenth century concern these two method of rise to be a prince by ability or fortune i wish to adduce two example within our own recollection and these be francesco sforzaand cesare borgia francesco by proper mean and with great ability from be a private person rise to be duke of milan and that which he have acquire with a thousand anxieties he keep with little trouble on the other hand cesare borgia call by the people duke valentino acquire hi state during the ascendancy of hi father and on it decline he lose it notwithstanding that he have take every measure and do all that ought to be do by a wise and able man to fix firmly hi root in the state which the arm and fortune of other have bestow on him francesco sforza bear die he marry bianca maria visconti a natural daughter of filippo visconti the duke of milan on whose death he procure hi own elevation to the duchy machiavelli be the accredited agent of the florentine republic to cesare borgia during the transaction which lead up to the assassination of the orsini and vitellus at sinigalia and along with hi letter to hi chief in florence he have leave an account write ten year before the prince of the proceeding of the duke in hi descritione del modo tenuto dal duca valentino nello ammazzare vitellozzo vitellus etc a translation of which be append to the present work because a be state above he who have not first lay hi foundation may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards but they will be lay with trouble to the architect and danger to the building if therefore all the step take by the duke be consider it will be see that he lay solid foundation for hi future power and i do not consider it superfluous to discuss them because i do not know what good precept to give a new prince than the example of hi action and if hi disposition be of no avail that be not hi fault but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune alexander the sixth in wish to aggrandize the duke hi son have many immediate and prospective difficulty firstly he do not see hi way to make him master of any state that be not a state of the church and if he be willing to rob the church he know that the duke of milan and the venetian would not consent because faenza and rimini be already under the protection of the venetian besides this he saw the arm of italy especially those by which he might have be assist in hand that would fear the aggrandizement of the pope namely the orsini and the colonnesi and their follow it behove him therefore to upset this state of affair and embroil the power so a to make himself securely master of part of their state this be easy for him to do because he find the venetian move by other reason incline to bring back the french into italy he would not only not oppose this but he would render it more easy by dissolve the former marriage of king louis therefore the king come into italy with the assistance of the venetian and the consent of alexander he be no sooner in milan than the pope have soldier from him for the attempt on the romagna which yield to him on the reputation of the king the duke therefore have acquire the romagna and beat the colonnesi while wish to hold that and to advance far be hinder by two thing the one hi force do not appear loyal to him the other the goodwill of france that be to say he fear that the force of the orsini which he be use would not stand to him that not only might they hinder him from win more but might themselves seize what he have win and that the king might also do the same of the orsini he have a warning when after take faenza and attack bologna he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack and a to the king he learn hi mind when he himself after take the duchy of urbino attack tuscany and the king make him desist from that undertake hence the duke decide to depend no more upon the arm and the luck of other for the first thing he weaken the orsini and colonnesi party in romeby gain to himself all their adherent who be gentleman make them hi gentleman give them good pay and accord to their rank honour them with office and command in such a way that in a few month all attachment to the faction be destroy and turn entirely to the duke after this he await an opportunity to crush the orsini have scatter the adherent of the colonna house this come to him soon and he use it well for the orsini perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the church be ruin to them call a meeting of the magione in perugia from this spring the rebellion at urbino and the tumult in the romagna with endless danger to the duke all of which he overcome with the help of the french having restore hi authority not to leave it at risk by trust either to the french or other outside force he have recourse to hi wile and he know so well how to conceal hi mind that by the mediation of signor pagolowhom the duke do not fail to secure with all kind of attention give him money apparel and horsesthe orsini be reconcile so that their simplicity bring them into hi power at sinigaliahaving exterminate the leader and turn their partisan into hi friends the duke lay sufficiently good foundation to hi power have all the romagna and the duchy of urbino and the people now begin to appreciate their prosperity he gain them all over to himself and a this point be worthy of notice and to be imitate by other i be not willing to leave it out sinigalia st december when the duke occupy the romagna he find it under the rule of weak master who rather plunder their subject than rule them and give them more cause for disunion than for union so that the country be full of robbery quarrel and every kind of violence and so wish to bring back peace and obedience to authority he consider it necessary to give it a good governor thereupon he promote messer ramiro dorcoa swift and cruel man to whom he give the full power this man in a short time restore peace and unity with the great success afterwards the duke consider that it be not advisable to confer such excessive authority for he have no doubt but that he would become odious so he set up a court of judgment in the country under a most excellent president wherein all city have their advocate and because he know that the past severity have cause some hatred against himself so to clear himself in the mind of the people and gain them entirely to himself he desire to show that if any cruelty have be practise it have not originate with him but in the natural sternness of the minister under this pretence he take ramiro and one morning cause him to be execute and leave on the piazza at cesena with the block and a bloody knife at hi side the barbarity of this spectacle cause the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed ramiro dorco ramiro de lorqua but let u return whence we start i say that the duke find himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secure from immediate danger by have arm himself in hi own way and have in a great measure crush those force in hi vicinity that could injure him if he wish to proceed with hi conquest have next to consider france for he know that the king who too late be aware of hi mistake would not support him and from this time he begin to seek new alliance and to temporize with france in the expedition which she be make towards the kingdom of naples against the spaniard who be besiege gaeta it be hi intention to secure himself against them and this he would have quickly accomplish have alexander live such be hi line of action a to present affair but a to the future he have to fear in the first place that a new successor to the church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which alexander have give him so he decide to act in four way firstly by exterminate the family of those lord whom he have despoil so a to take away that pretext from the pope secondly by win to himself all the gentleman of romeso a to be able to curb the pope with their aid a have be observe thirdly by convert the college more to himself fourthly by acquire so much power before the pope should die that he could by hi own measure resist the first shock of these four thing at the death of alexander he have accomplish three for he have kill a many of the dispossessed lord a he could lay hand on and few have escape he have win over the roman gentleman and he have the most numerous party in the college and a to any fresh acquisition he intend to become master of tuscany for he already possess perugia and piombino and pisa be under hi protection and a he have no longer to study france for the french be already drive out of the kingdom of naples by the spaniard and in this way both be compel to buy hi goodwill he pounce down upon pisa after this lucca and siena yield at once partly through hatred and partly through fear of the florentine and the florentine would have have no remedy have he continue to prosper a he be prosper the year that alexander die for he have acquire so much power and reputation that he would have stand by himself and no longer have depend on the luck and the force of other but solely on hi own power and ability but alexander die five year after he have first draw the sword he leave the duke with the state of romagna alone consolidate with the rest in the air between two most powerful hostile army and sick unto death yet there be in the duke such boldness and ability and he know so well how men be to be win or lose and so firm be the foundation which in so short a time he have lay that if he have not have those army on hi back or if he have be in good health he would have overcome all difficulty and it be see that hi foundation be good for the romagna await him for more than a month in romealthough but half alive he remain secure and whilst the baglioni the vitellus and the orsini might come to romethey could not effect anything against him if he could not have make pope him whom he wish at least the one whom he do not wish would not have be elect but if he have be in sound health at the death of alexandereverything would have be different to him on the day that julius the secondwas elect he tell me that he have think of everything that might occur at the death of hi father and have provide a remedy for all except that he have never anticipate that when the death do happen he himself would be on the point to die alexander vi die of fever th august julius ii be giuliano della rover cardinal of san pietro ad vincula born die when all the action of the duke be recall i do not know how to blame him but rather it appear to be a i have say that i ought to offer him for imitation to all those who by the fortune or the arm of other be raise to government because he have a lofty spirit and farreaching aim could not have regulate hi conduct otherwise and only the shortness of the life of alexander and hi own sickness frustrate hi design therefore he who consider it necessary to secure himself in hi new principality to win friend to overcome either by force or fraud to make himself beloved and fear by the people to be follow and revere by the soldier to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him to change the old order of thing for new to be severe and gracious magnanimous and liberal to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new to maintain friendship with king and prince in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution can not find a more lively example than the action of this man only can he be blame for the election of julius the second in whom he make a bad choice because a be say not be able to elect a pope to hi own mind he could have hinder any other from be elect pope and he ought never to have consent to the election of any cardinal whom he have injure or who have cause to fear him if they become pontiff for men injure either from fear or hatred those whom he have injure amongst other be san pietro ad vincula colonna san giorgio and ascaniothe rest in become pope have to fear him rouen and the spaniard except the latter from their relationship and obligations the former from hi influence the kingdom of france have relation with him therefore above everything the duke ought to have create a spaniard pope and fail him he ought to have consent to rouen and not san pietro ad vincula he who believe that new benefit will cause great personage to forget old injury be deceive therefore the duke err in hi choice and it be the cause of hi ultimate ruin san giorgio be raffaello riario ascanio be ascanio sforza chapter viii concerning those who have obtained a principality by wickedness although a prince may rise from a private station in two way neither of which can be entirely attribute to fortune or genius yet it be manifest to me that i must not be silent on them although one could be more copiously treat when i discuss republic these method be when either by some wicked or nefarious way one ascend to the principality or when by the favour of hi fellowcitizens a private person become the prince of hi country and speaking of the first method it will be illustrate by two examplesone ancient the other modernand without enter far into the subject i consider these two example will suffice those who may be compel to follow them agathocles the sicilianbecame king of syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position this man the son of a potter through all the change in hi fortune always lead an infamous life nevertheless he accompany hi infamy with so much ability of mind and body that have devote himself to the military profession he rise through it rank to be praetor of syracuse being establish in that position and have deliberately resolve to make himself prince and to seize by violence without obligation to other that which have be concede to him by assent he come to an understanding for this purpose with amilcar the carthaginian who with hi army be fight in sicily one morning he assemble the people and the senate of syracuse a if he have to discuss with them thing relate to the republic and at a give signal the soldier kill all the senator and the richest of the people these dead he seize and hold the princedom of that city without any civil commotion and although he be twice rout by the carthaginian and ultimately besiege yet not only be he able to defend hi city but leave part of hi men for it defence with the other he attack africa and in a short time raise the siege of syracuse the carthaginian reduce to extreme necessity be compel to come to term with agathocles and leave sicily to him have to be content with the possession of africa agathocles the sicilian born bc die bc therefore he who consider the action and the genius of this man will see nothing or little which can be attribute to fortune inasmuch a he attain preeminence a be show above not by the favour of any one but step by step in the military profession which step be gain with a thousand trouble and peril and be afterwards boldly hold by him with many hazardous danger yet it can not be call talent to slay fellowcitizens to deceive friend to be without faith without mercy without religion such method may gain empire but not glory still if the courage of agathocles in enter into and extricate himself from danger be consider together with hi greatness of mind in endure and overcome hardship it can not be see why he should be esteem less than the most notable captain nevertheless hi barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrate among the most excellent men what he achieve can not be attribute either to fortune or genius in our time during the rule of alexander the sixth oliverotto da fermo have be leave an orphan many year before be bring up by hi maternal uncle giovanni fogliani and in the early day of hi youth send to fight under pagolo vitellus that be train under hi discipline he might attain some high position in the military profession after pagolo die he fought under hi brother vitellozzo and in a very short time be endow with wit and a vigorous body and mind he become the first man in hi profession but it appear a paltry thing to serve under other he resolve with the aid of some citizen of fermo to whom the slavery of their country be dear than it liberty and with the help of the vitelleschi to seize fermo so he write to giovanni fogliani that have be away from home for many year he wish to visit him and hi city and in some measure to look upon hi patrimony and although he have not labour to acquire anything except honour yet in order that the citizen should see he have not spend hi time in vain he desire to come honourably so would be accompany by one hundred horseman hi friend and retainer and he entreat giovanni to arrange that he should be receive honourably by the fermians all of which would be not only to hi honour but also to that of giovanni himself who have bring him up giovanni therefore do not fail in any attention due to hi nephew and he cause him to be honourably receive by the fermians and he lodge him in hi own house where have pass some day and have arrange what be necessary for hi wicked design oliverotto give a solemn banquet to which he invite giovanni fogliani and the chief of fermo when the viand and all the other entertainment that be usual in such banquet be finish oliverotto artfully begin certain grave discourse speaking of the greatness of pope alexander and hi son cesare and of their enterprise to which discourse giovanni and other answer but he rise at once say that such matter ought to be discuss in a more private place and he betook himself to a chamber whither giovanni and the rest of the citizen go in after him no sooner be they seat than soldier issue from secret place and slaughter giovanni and the rest after these murder oliverotto mount on horseback rode up and down the town and besiege the chief magistrate in the palace so that in fear the people be force to obey him and to form a government of which he make himself the prince he kill all the malcontent who be able to injure him and strengthen himself with new civil and military ordinance in such a way that in the year during which he hold the principality not only be he secure in the city of fermo but he have become formidable to all hi neighbour and hi destruction would have be as difficult a that of agathocles if he have not allow himself to be overreach by cesare borgia who take him with the orsini and vitellus at sinigalia a be state above thus one year after he have commit this parricide he be strangle together with vitellozzo whom he have make hi leader in valour and wickedness some may wonder how it can happen that agathocles and hi like after infinite treachery and cruelty should live for long secure in hi country and defend himself from external enemy and never be conspire against by hi own citizen see that many other by mean of cruelty have never be able even in peaceful time to hold the state still less in the doubtful time of war i believe that this follow from severitiesbeing badly or properly use those may be call properly use if of evil it be possible to speak well that be apply at one blow and be necessary to one security and that be not persist in afterwards unless they can be turn to the advantage of the subject the badly employ be those which notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement multiply with time rather than decrease those who practise the first system be able by aid of god or man to mitigate in some degree their rule a agathocles do it be impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves mr burd suggest that this word probably come near the modern equivalent of machiavelli think when he speak of crudelta than the more obvious cruelty hence it be to be remark that in seize a state the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injury which it be necessary for him to inflict and to do them all at one stroke so a not to have to repeat them daily and thus by not unsettle men he will be able to reassure them and win them to himself by benefit he who do otherwise either from timidity or evil advice be always compel to keep the knife in hi hand neither can he rely on hi subject nor can they attach themselves to him owe to their continue and repeat wrong for injury ought to be do all at one time so that be taste less they offend less benefit ought to be give little by little so that the flavour of them may last long and above all thing a prince ought to live amongst hi people in such a way that no unexpected circumstance whether of good or evil shall make him change because if the necessity for this come in troubled time you be too late for harsh measure and mild one will not help you for they will be consider a force from you and no one will be under any obligation to you for them chapter ix concerning a civil principality but come to the other pointwhere a lead citizen become the prince of hi country not by wickedness or any intolerable violence but by the favour of hi fellow citizensthis may be call a civil principality nor be genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it but rather a happy shrewdness i say then that such a principality be obtain either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the noble because in all city these two distinct party be find and from this it arise that the people do not wish to be rule nor oppress by the noble and the noble wish to rule and oppress the people and from these two opposite desire there arise in city one of three result either a principality self government or anarchy a principality be create either by the people or by the noble accordingly a one or other of them have the opportunity for the noble see they can not withstand the people begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves and they make him a prince so that under hi shadow they can give vent to their ambition the people find they can not resist the noble also cry up the reputation of one of themselves and make him a prince so a to be defend by hi authority he who obtain sovereignty by the assistance of the noble maintain himself with more difficulty than he who come to it by the aid of the people because the former find himself with many around him who consider themselves hi equal and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to hi liking but he who reach sovereignty by popular favour find himself alone and have none around him or few who be not prepared to obey him besides this one can not by fair deal and without injury to other satisfy the noble but you can satisfy the people for their object be more righteous than that of the noble the latter wishing to oppress while the former only desire not to be oppress it be to be add also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people because of their be too many whilst from the noble he can secure himself a they be few in number the bad that a prince may expect from a hostile people be to be abandon by them but from hostile noble he have not only to fear abandonment but also that they will rise against him for they be in these affair more far see and astute always come forward in time to save themselves and to obtain favour from him whom they expect to prevail further the prince be compel to live always with the same people but he can do well without the same noble be able to make and unmake them daily and to give or wake away authority when it please him therefore to make this point clearer i say that the noble ought to be look at mainly in two way that be to say they either shape their course in such a way a bind them entirely to your fortune or they do not those who so bind themselves and be not rapacious ought to be honour and love those who do not bind themselves may be deal with in two way they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage in which case you ought to make use of them especially of those who be of good counsel and thus whilst in prosperity you honour them in adversity you do not have to fear them but when for their own ambitious end they shun bind themselves it be a token that they be give more thought to themselves than to you and a prince out to guard against such and to fear them a if they be open enemy because in adversity they always help to ruin him therefore one who become a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly and this he can easily do see they only ask not to be oppress by him but one who in opposition to the people become a prince by the favour of the noble ought above everything to seek to win the people over to himself and this he may easily do if he take them under hi protection because men when they receive good from him of whom they be expect evil be bind more closely to their benefactor thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he have be raise to the principality by their favour and the prince can win their affection in many way but a these vary accord to the circumstance one can not give fixed rule so i omit them but i repeat it be necessary for a prince to have the people friendly otherwise he have no security in adversity nabisprince of the spartan sustain the attack of all greece and of a victorious roman army and against them he defend hi country and hi government and for the overcoming of this peril it be only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few but this would not have be sufficient have the people be hostile and do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that he who build on the people build on the mud for this be true when a private citizen make a foundation there and persuade himself that the people will free him when he be oppress by hi enemy or by the magistrate wherein he would find himself very often deceive as happen to the gracchi in romeand to messer giorgio scaliin florence but grant a prince who have establish himself a above who can command and be a man of courage undismayed in adversity who do not fail in other qualification and who by hi resolution and energy keep the whole people encouragedsuch a one will never find himself deceive in them and it will be show that he have lay hi foundation well nabis tyrant of sparta conquer by the roman under flamininus in bc kill bc messer giorgio scali this event be to be find in machiavelli florentine history book iii these principality be liable to danger when they be pass from the civil to the absolute order of government for such prince either rule personally or through magistrate in the latter case their government be weak and more insecure because it rest entirely on the goodwill of those citizen who be raise to the magistracy and who especially in troubled time can destroy the government with great ease either by intrigue or open defiance and the prince have not the chance amid tumult to exercise absolute authority because the citizen and subject accustom to receive order from magistrate be not of a mind to obey him amid these confusion and there will always be in doubtful time a scarcity of men whom he can trust for such a prince can not rely upon what he observe in quiet time when citizen have need of the state because then every one agree with him they all promise and when death be far distant they all wish to die for him but in troubled time when the state have need of it citizen then he find but few and so much the more be this experiment dangerous inasmuch a it can only be try once therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that hi citizen will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him and then he will always find them faithful chapter x concerning the way in which the strength of all principality ought to be measured it be necessary to consider another point in examine the character of these principality that be whether a prince have such power that in case of need he can support himself with hi own resource or whether he have always need of the assistance of other and to make this quite clear i say that i consider those who be able to support themselves by their own resource who can either by abundance of men or money raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who come to attack them and i consider those always to have need of other who can not show themselves against the enemy in the field but be force to defend themselves by shelter behind wall the first case have be discuss but we will speak of it again should it recur in the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such prince to provision and fortify their town and not on any account to defend the country and whoever shall fortify hi town well and shall have manage the other concern of hi subject in the way state above and to be often repeat will never be attack without great caution for men be always adverse to enterprises where difficulty can be see and it will be see not to be an easy thing to attack one who have hi town well fortify and be not hat by hi people the city of germany be absolutely free they own but little country around them and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suit them nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them because they be fortify in such a way that every one think the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult see they have proper ditch and wall they have sufficient artillery and they always keep in public depot enough for one year eat drinking and firing and beyond this to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state they always have the mean of give work to the community in those labour that be the life and strength of the city and on the pursuit of which the people be support they also hold military exercise in repute and moreover have many ordinance to uphold them therefore a prince who have a strong city and have not make himself odious will not be attack or if any one should attack he will only be drive off with disgrace again because that the affair of this world be so changeable it be almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without be interfere with and whoever should reply if the people have property outside the city and see it burnt they will not remain patient and the long siege and self interest will make them forget their prince to this i answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulty by give at one time hope to hi subject that the evil will not be for long at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy then preserve himself adroitly from those subject who seem to him to be too bold further the enemy would naturally on hi arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirit of the people be still hot and ready for the defence and therefore so much the less ought the prince to hesitate because after a time when spirit have cool the damage be already do the ill be incur and there be no longer any remedy and therefore they be so much the more ready to unite with their prince he appear to be under obligation to them now that their house have be burn and their possession ruin in hi defence for it be the nature of men to be bind by the benefit they confer as much a by those they receive therefore if everything be well consider it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the mind of hi citizen steadfast from first to last when he do not fail to support and defend them chapter xi concerning ecclesiastical principality it only remain now to speak of ecclesiastical principality touch which all difficulty be prior to get possession because they be acquire either by capacity or good fortune and they can be hold without either for they be sustain by the ancient ordinance of religion which be so allpowerful and of such a character that the principality may be hold no matter how their prince behave and live these prince alone have state and do not defend them and they have subject and do not rule them and the state although unguarded be not take from them and the subject although not rule do not care and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves such principality only be secure and happy but be uphold by power to which the human mind can not reach i shall speak no more of them because be exalt and maintain by god it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them nevertheless if any one should ask of me how come it that the church have attain such greatness in temporal power see that from alexander backwards the italian potentates not only those who have be call potentate but every baron and lord though the small have value the temporal power very slightlyyet now a king of france tremble before it and it have be able to drive him from italy and to ruin the venetiansalthough this may be very manifest it do not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory before charles king of france pass into italythis country be under the dominion of the pope the venetian the king of naples the duke of milan and the florentine these potentate have two principal anxiety the one that no foreigner should enter italy under arm the other that none of themselves should seize more territory those about whom there be the most anxiety be the pope and the venetian to restrain the venetian the union of all the other be necessary a it be for the defence of ferrara and to keep down the pope they make use of the baron of romewho be divide into two faction orsini and colonnesi have always a pretext for disorder and stand with arm in their hand under the eye of the pontiff keep the pontificate weak and powerless and although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope such a sixtus yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyance and the short life of a pope be also a cause of weakness for in the ten year which be the average life of a pope he can with difficulty lower one of the faction and if so to speak one people should almost destroy the colonnesi another would arise hostile to the orsini who would support their opponent and yet would not have time to ruin the orsini this be the reason why the temporal power of the pope be little esteem in italy charles viii invade italy in alexander the sixth arose afterwards who of all the pontiff that have ever be show how a pope with both money and arm be able to prevail and through the instrumentality of the duke valentino and by reason of the entry of the french he bring about all those thing which i have discuss above in the action of the duke and although hi intention be not to aggrandize the church but the duke nevertheless what he do contribute to the greatness of the church which after hi death and the ruin of the duke become the heir to all hi labour pope julius come afterwards and find the church strong possess all the romagna the baron of romereduce to impotence and through the chastisement of alexander the faction wipe out he also find the way open to accumulate money in a manner such a have never be practise before alexander time such thing julius not only follow but improve upon and he intend to gain bologna to ruin the venetian and to drive the french out of italy all of these enterprise prosper with him and so much the more to hi credit inasmuch a he do everything to strengthen the church and not any private person he keep also the orsini and colonnesi faction within the bound in which he find them and although there be among them some mind to make disturbance nevertheless he hold two thing firm the one the greatness of the church with which he terrify them and the other not allow them to have their own cardinal who cause the disorder among them for whenever these faction have their cardinal they do not remain quiet for long because cardinal foster the faction in romeand out of it and the baron be compel to support them and thus from the ambition of prelate arise disorder and tumult among the baron for these reason hi holiness pope leofound the pontificate most powerful and it be to be hop that if other make it great in arm he will make it still great and more venerate by hi goodness and infinite other virtue pope leo x be the cardinal de medici chapter xii how many kind of soldiery there are and concerning mercenary having discourse particularly on the characteristic of such principality a in the beginning i propose to discuss and have consider in some degree the cause of their be good or bad and have show the method by which many have seek to acquire them and to hold them it now remain for me to discuss generally the mean of offence and defence which belong to each of them we have see above how necessary it be for a prince to have hi foundation well laid otherwise it follow of necessity he will go to ruin the chief foundation of all state new as well a old or composite be good law and good arm and a there can not be good law where the state be not well arm it follow that where they be well arm they have good law i shall leave the law out of the discussion and shall speak of the arm i say therefore that the arm with which a prince defend hi state be either hi own or they be mercenaries auxiliary or mixed mercenary and auxiliary be useless and dangerous and if one hold hi state base on these arm he will stand neither firm nor safe for they be disunite ambitious and without discipline unfaithful valiant before friend cowardly before enemy they have neither the fear of god nor fidelity to men and destruction be defer only so long a the attack be for in peace one be rob by them and in war by the enemy the fact be they have no other attraction or reason for keep the field than a trifle of stipend which be not sufficient to make them willing to die for you they be ready enough to be your soldier whilst you do not make war but if war come they take themselves off or run from the foe which i should have little trouble to prove for the ruin of italy have be cause by nothing els than by rest all her hope for many year on mercenary and although they formerly make some display and appear valiant amongst themselves yet when the foreigner come they show what they be thus it be that charles king of france be allow to seize italy with chalk in handand he who tell u that our sin be the cause of it tell the truth but they be not the sin he imagine but those which i have relate and a they be the sin of prince it be the prince who have also suffer the penalty with chalk in hand col gesso this be one of the bons mot of alexander vi and refers to the ease with which charles viii seize italy imply that it be only necessary for him to send hi quartermaster to chalk up the billet for hi soldier to conquer the country cf the history of henry vii by lord bacon king charles have conquer the realm of naples and lose it again in a kind of a felicity of a dream he pass the whole length of italy without resistance so that it be true what pope alexander be wont to say that the frenchman come into italy with chalk in their hand to mark up their lodging rather than with sword to fight i wish to demonstrate far the infelicity of these arm the mercenary captain be either capable men or they be not if they be you can not trust them because they always aspire to their own greatness either by oppress you who be their master or other contrary to your intention but if the captain be not skilful you be ruin in the usual way and if it be urge that whoever be arm will act in the same way whether mercenary or not i reply that when arm have to be resort to either by a prince or a republic then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain the republic have to send it citizen and when one be send who do not turn out satisfactorily it ought to recall him and when one be worthy to hold him by the law so that he do not leave the command and experience have show prince and republic singlehanded make the great progress and mercenary do nothing except damage and it be more difficult to bring a republic arm with it own arm under the sway of one of it citizen than it be to bring one arm with foreign arm romeand sparta stand for many age arm and free the switzers be completely arm and quite free of ancient mercenary for example there be the carthaginian who be oppress by their mercenary soldier after the first war with the roman although the carthaginian have their own citizen for captain after the death of epaminondas philip of macedon be make captain of their soldier by the theban and after victory he take away their liberty duke filippo be dead the milanese enlist francesco sforza against the venetian and he have overcome the enemy at caravaggio himself with them to crush the milanese hi master hi father sforza have be engage by queen johannaof naples leave her unprotected so that she be force to throw herself into the arm of the king of aragon in order to save her kingdom and if the venetian and florentine formerly extend their dominion by these arm and yet their captain do not make themselves prince but have defend them i reply that the florentine in this case have be favour by chance for of the able captain of whom they might have stand in fear some have not conquer some have be oppose and other have turn their ambition elsewhere one who do not conquer be giovanni acutoand since he do not conquer hi fidelity can not be prove but every one will acknowledge that have he conquer the florentine would have stand at hi discretion sforza have the bracceschi always against him so they watch each other francesco turn hi ambition to lombardy braccio against the church and the kingdom of naples but let u come to that which happen a short while ago the florentine appoint a their captain pagolo vitellus a most prudent man who from a private position have rise to the great renown if this man have take pisa nobody can deny that it would have be proper for the florentine to keep in with him for if he become the soldier of their enemy they have no mean of resist and if they hold to him they must obey him the venetian if their achievement be consider will be see to have act safely and gloriously so long a they send to war their own men when with arm gentleman and plebians they do valiantly this be before they turn to enterprise on land but when they begin to fight on land they forsake this virtue and follow the custom of italy and in the beginning of their expansion on land through not have much territory and because of their great reputation they have not much to fear from their captain but when they expand a under carmignuolathey have a taste of this mistake for have find him a most valiant man they beat the duke of milan under hi leadership and on the other hand know how lukewarm he be in the war they fear they would no longer conquer under him and for this reason they be not willing nor be they able to let him go and so not to lose again that which they have acquire they be compel in order to secure themselves to murder him they have afterwards for their captain bartolomeo da bergamo roberto da san severino the count of pitiglianoand the like under whom they have to dread loss and not gain a happened afterwards at vailawhere in one battle they lose that which in eight hundred year they have acquire with so much trouble because from such arm conquest come but slowly long delay and inconsiderable but the loss sudden and portentous battle of caravaggio th september johanna ii of naples the widow of ladislao king of naples giovanni acuto an english knight whose name be sir john hawkwood he fight in the english war in france and be knight by edward iii afterwards he collect a body of troop and go into italy these become the famous white company he take part in many war and die in florence in he be bear about at sible hedingham a village in essex he marry domnia a daughter of bernabo visconti carmignuola francesco bussone born at carmagnola about execute at venice th may bartolomeo colleoni of bergamo die roberto of san severino die fight for venice against sigismund duke of austria in primo capitano in italiamachiavelli count of pitigliano nicolo orsini bear died battle of vaila in and a with these example i have reach italy which have be rule for many year by mercenary i wish to discuss them more seriously in order that have see their rise and progress one may be well prepare to counteract them you must understand that the empire have recently come to be repudiate in italy that the pope have acquire more temporal power and that italy have be divide up into more state for the reason that many of the great city take up arm against their noble who formerly favour by the emperor be oppress them whilst the church be favour them so a to gain authority in temporal power in many other their citizen become prince from this it come to pass that italy fell partly into the hand of the church and of republic and the church consisting of priest and the republic of citizen unaccustomed to arm both commence to enlist foreigner the first who give renown to this soldiery be alberigo da coniothe romagnian from the school of this man sprang among other braccio and sforza who in their time be the arbiter of italy after these come all the other captain who till now have direct the arm of italy and the end of all their valour have be that she have be overrun by charles rob by louis ravage by ferdinand and insult by the switzers the principle that have guide them have be first to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own they do this because subsist on their pay and without territory they be unable to support many soldier and a few infantry do not give them any authority so they be lead to employ cavalry with a moderate force of which they be maintain and honour and affair be bring to such a pas that in an army of twenty thousand soldier there be not to be find two thousand foot soldier they have besides this use every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldier not kill in the fray but take prisoner and liberate without ransom they do not attack town at night nor do the garrison of the town attack encampment at night they do not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch nor do they campaign in the winter all these thing be permit by their military rule and devise by them to avoid a i have say both fatigue and danger thus they have bring italy to slavery and contempt alberigo da conio alberico da barbiano count of cunio in romagna he be the leader of the famous company of st george compose entirely of italian soldier he die in chapter xiii concerning auxiliary mixed soldiery and one own auxiliary which be the other useless arm be employ when a prince be call in with hi force to aid and defend a be do by pope julius in the most recent time for he have in the enterprise against ferrara have poor proof of hi mercenary turn to auxiliary and stipulate with ferdinand king of spainfor hi assistance with men and arm these arm may be useful and good in themselves but for him who call them in they be always disadvantageous for lose one be undone and win one be their captive ferdinand v f ii of aragon and sicily f iii of naples surnamed the catholic bear die and although ancient history may be full of example i do not wish to leave this recent one of pope julius the second the peril of which can not fail to be perceive for he wish to get ferrara throw himself entirely into the hand of the foreigner but hi good fortune bring about a third event so that he do not reap the fruit of hi rash choice because have hi auxiliary rout at ravenna and the switzers have rise and drive out the conqueror against all expectation both hi and other it so come to pass that he do not become prisoner to hi enemy they have flee nor to hi auxiliary he have conquer by other arm than theirs the florentine be entirely without arm send ten thousand frenchman to take pisa whereby they run more danger than at any other time of their trouble the emperor of constantinopleto oppose hi neighbour send ten thousand turk into greece who on the war be finish be not willing to quit this be the beginning of the servitude of greece to the infidel joannes cantacuzenus bear die therefore let him who have no desire to conquer make use of these arm for they be much more hazardous than mercenary because with them the ruin be ready make they be all united all yield obedience to other but with mercenary when they have conquer more time and good opportunity be need to injure you they be not all of one community they be find and pay by you and a third party which you have make their head be not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you in conclusion in mercenary dastardy be most dangerous in auxiliary valour the wise prince therefore have always avoid these arm and turn to hi own and have be willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the other not deem that a real victory which be gain with the arm of other i shall never hesitate to cite cesare borgia and hi action this duke enter the romagna with auxiliary take there only french soldier and with them he capture imola and forli but afterwards such force not appear to him reliable he turn to mercenary discern less danger in them and enlist the orsini and vitellus whom presently on handle and find them doubtful unfaithful and dangerous he destroy and turn to hi own men and the difference between one and the other of these force can easily be see when one consider the difference there be in the reputation of the duke when he have the french when he have the orsini and vitellus and when he rely on hi own soldier on whose fidelity he could always count and find it ever increase he be never esteem more highly than when every one saw that he be complete master of hi own force i be not intend to go beyond italian and recent example but i be unwilling to leave out hiero the syracusan he be one of those i have name above this man a i have say make head of the army by the syracusans soon find out that a mercenary soldiery constitute like our italian condottieri be of no use and it appear to him that he could neither keep them not let them go he have them all cut to piece and afterwards make war with hi own force and not with alien i wish also to recall to memory an instance from the old testament applicable to this subject david offer himself to saul to fight with goliath the philistine champion and to give him courage saul arm him with hi own weapon which david reject as soon a he have them on hi back say he could make no use of them and that he wish to meet the enemy with hi sling and hi knife in conclusion the arm of other either fall from your back or they weigh you down or they bind you fast charles the sevenththe father of king louis the eleventhhaving by good fortune and valour liberate france from the english recognize the necessity of be arm with force of hi own and he establish in hi kingdom ordinance concern menatarms and infantry afterwards hi son king louis abolish the infantry and begin to enlist the switzers which mistake follow by other be a be now see a source of peril to that kingdom because have raise the reputation of the switzers he have entirely diminish the value of hi own arm for he have destroy the infantry altogether and hi menatarms he have subordinate to other for be a they be so accustomed to fight along with switzers it do not appear that they can now conquer without them hence it arise that the french can not stand against the switzers and without the switzers they do not come off well against other the army of the french have thus become mixed partly mercenary and partly national both of which arm together be much good than mercenary alone or auxiliary alone but much inferior to one own force and this example prove it for the kingdom of france would be unconquerable if the ordinance of charles have be enlarge or maintain charles vii of france surnamed the victorious born die louis xi son of the above born die but the scanty wisdom of man on enter into an affair which look well at first can not discern the poison that be hide in it a i have say above of hectic fever therefore if he who rule a principality can not recognize evil until they be upon him he be not truly wise and this insight be give to few and if the first disaster to the roman empireshould be examine it will be find to have commence only with the enlisting of the goth because from that time the vigour of the roman empire begin to decline and all that valour which have raise it pass away to other many speaker to the house the other night in the debate on the reduction of armament seem to show a most lamentable ignorance of the condition under which the british empire maintain it existence when mr balfour reply to the allegation that the roman empire sink under the weight of it military obligation he say that this be wholly unhistorical he might well have add that the roman power be at it zenith when every citizen acknowledge hi liability to fight for the state but that it begin to decline as soon a this obligation be no long recognizedpall mall gazette th may i conclude therefore that no principality be secure without have it own force on the contrary it be entirely dependent on good fortune not have the valour which in adversity would defend it and it have always be the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable a fame or power not found on it own strength and one own force be those which be compose either of subject citizen or dependent all other be mercenary or auxiliary and the way to make ready one own force will be easily find if the rule suggest by me shall be reflect upon and if one will consider how philip the father of alexander the great and many republic and prince have arm and organize themselves to which rule i entirely commit myself chapter xiv that which concern a prince on the subject of the art of war a prince ought to have no other aim or think nor select anything els for hi study than war and it rule and discipline for this be the sole art that belong to him who rule and it be of such force that it not only upholds those who be born prince but it often enable men to rise from a private station to that rank and on the contrary it be see that when prince have think more of ease than of arm they have lose their state and the first cause of your lose it be to neglect this art and what enable you to acquire a state be to be master of the art francesco sforza through be martial from a private person become duke of milan and the son through avoid the hardship and trouble of arm from duke become private person for among other evil which be unarmed brings you it cause you to be despise and this be one of those ignominy against which a prince ought to guard himself a be show later on because there be nothing proportionate between the arm and the unarmed and it be not reasonable that he who be arm should yield obedience willingly to him who be unarmed or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servant because there be in the one disdain and in the other suspicion it be not possible for them to work well together and therefore a prince who do not understand the art of war over and above the other misfortune already mention can not be respect by hi soldier nor can he rely on them he ought never therefore to have out of hi thought this subject of war and in peace he should addict himself more to it exercise than in war this he can do in two way the one by action the other by study a regard action he ought above all thing to keep hi men well organize and drill to follow incessantly the chase by which he accustom hi body to hardship and learn something of the nature of locality and get to find out how the mountain rise how the valley open out how the plain lie and to understand the nature of river and marsh and in all this to take the great care which knowledge be useful in two way firstly he learn to know hi country and be well able to undertake it defence afterwards by mean of the knowledge and observation of that locality he understand with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter because the hill valley and plain and river and marsh that be for instance in tuscany have a certain resemblance to those of other country so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of other and the prince that lack this skill lack the essential which it be desirable that a captain should possess for it teach him to surprise hi enemy to select quarter to lead army to array the battle to besiege town to advantage philopoemenprince of the achaean among other praise which writer have bestow on him be commend because in time of peace he never have anything in hi mind but the rule of war and when he be in the country with friend he often stop and reason with them if the enemy should be upon that hill and we should find ourselves here with our army with whom would be the advantage how should one best advance to meet him keep the rank if we should wish to retreat how ought we to pursue and he would set forth to them a he go all the chance that could befall an army he would listen to their opinion and state hi confirm it with reason so that by these continual discussion there could never arise in time of war any unexpected circumstance that he could not deal with philopoemen the last of the greek born bc die bc but to exercise the intellect the prince should read history and study there the action of illustrious men to see how they have bear themselves in war to examine the cause of their victory and defeat so a to avoid the latter and imitate the former and above all do a an illustrious man do who take a an exemplar one who have be praise and famous before him and whose achievement and deed he always keep in hi mind a it be say alexander the great imitated achilles caesar alexander scipio cyrus and whoever read the life of cyrus write by xenophon will recognize afterwards in the life of scipio how that imitation be hi glory and how in chastity affability humanity and liberality scipio conform to those thing which have be write of cyrus by xenophon a wise prince ought to observe some such rule and never in peaceful time stand idle but increase hi resource with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity so that if fortune chance it may find him prepared to resist her blow chapter xv concerning thing for which men and especially prince are praised or blamed it remain now to see what ought to be the rule of conduct for a prince towards subject and friend and a i know that many have write on this point i expect i shall be consider presumptuous in mention it again especially a in discuss it i shall depart from the method of other people but it be my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehend it it appear to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it for many have picture republic and principality which in fact have never be know or see because how one live be so far distant from how one ought to live that he who neglect what be do for what ought to be do sooner effect hi ruin than hi preservation for a man who wish to act entirely up to hi profession of virtue soon meet with what destroy him among so much that be evil hence it be necessary for a prince wish to hold hi own to know how to do wrong and to make use of it or not accord to necessity therefore put on one side imaginary thing concern a prince and discuss those which be real i say that all men when they be speak of and chiefly prince for be more highly place be remarkable for some of those quality which bring them either blame or praise and thus it be that one be repute liberal another miserly use a tuscan term because an avaricious person in our language be still he who desire to possess by robbery whilst we call one miserly who deprive himself too much of the use of hi own one be repute generous one rapacious one cruel one compassionate one faithless another faithful one effeminate and cowardly another bold and brave one affable another haughty one lascivious another chaste one sincere another cunning one hard another easy one grave another frivolous one religious another unbelieving and the like and i know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above quality that be consider good but because they can neither be entirely possess nor observe for human condition do not permit it it be necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vice which would lose him hi state and also to keep himself if it be possible from those which would not lose him it but this not be possible he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them and again he need not make himself uneasy at incur a reproach for those vice without which the state can only be save with difficulty for if everything be consider carefully it will be find that something which look like virtue if follow would be hi ruin whilst something els which look like vice yet follow bring him security and prosperity chapter xvi concerning liberality and meanness commencing then with the first of the abovenamed characteristic i say that it would be well to be repute liberal nevertheless liberality exercise in a way that do not bring you the reputation for it injure you for if one exercise it honestly and a it should be exercise it may not become known and you will not avoid the reproach of it opposite therefore any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal be oblige to avoid no attribute of magnificence so that a prince thus incline will consume in such act all hi property and will be compel in the end if he wish to maintain the name of liberal to unduly weigh down hi people and tax them and do everything he can to get money this will soon make him odious to hi subject and become poor he will be little value by any one thus with hi liberality have offend many and reward few he be affect by the very first trouble and imperil by whatever may be the first danger recognize this himself and wish to draw back from it he run at once into the reproach of be miserly therefore a prince not be able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it be recognize except to hi cost if he be wise he ought not to fear the reputation of be mean for in time he will come to be more consider than if liberal see that with hi economy hi revenue be enough that he can defend himself against all attack and be able to engage in enterprise without burden hi people thus it come to pass that he exercise liberality towards all from whom he do not take who be numberless and meanness towards those to whom he do not give who be few we have not see great thing do in our time except by those who have be consider mean the rest have fail pope julius the second be assist in reach the papacy by a reputation for liberality yet he do not strive afterwards to keep it up when he make war on the king of france and he make many war without impose any extraordinary tax on hi subject for he supply hi additional expense out of hi long thriftiness the present king of spain would not have undertake or conquer in so many enterprise if he have be repute liberal a prince therefore provide that he have not to rob hi subject that he can defend himself that he do not become poor and abject that he be not force to become rapacious ought to hold of little account a reputation for be mean for it be one of those vice which will enable him to govern and if any one should say caesar obtain empire by liberality and many other have reach the high position by have be liberal and by be consider so i answer either you be a prince in fact or in a way to become one in the first case this liberality be dangerous in the second it be very necessary to be consider liberal and caesar be one of those who wish to become preeminent in romebut if he have survive after become so and have not moderate hi expense he would have destroy hi government and if any one should reply many have be prince and have do great thing with army who have be consider very liberal i reply either a prince spend that which be hi own or hi subject or els that of other in the first case he ought to be spar in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality and to the prince who go forth with hi army support it by pillage sack and extortion handling that which belong to other this liberality be necessary otherwise he would not be follow by soldier and of that which be neither yours nor your subject you can be a ready giver a be cyrus caesar and alexander because it do not take away your reputation if you squander that of other but add to it it be only squander your own that injure you and there be nothing waste so rapidly a liberality for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so and so become either poor or despise or els in avoid poverty rapacious and hat and a prince should guard himself above all thing against be despise and hat and liberality lead you to both therefore it be wise to have a reputation for meanness which bring reproach without hatred than to be compel through seek a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which beget reproach with hatred chapter xvii concerning cruelty and clemency and whether it is better to be loved than feared coming now to the other quality mention above i say that every prince ought to desire to be consider clement and not cruel nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency cesare borgia be consider cruel notwithstanding hi cruelty reconcile the romagna unify it and restore it to peace and loyalty and if this be rightly consider he will be see to have be much more merciful than the florentine people who to avoid a reputation for cruelty permit pistoia to be destroyedtherefore a prince so long a he keep hi subject united and loyal ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty because with a few example he will be more merciful than those who through too much mercy allow disorder to arise from which follow murder or robbery for these be wont to injure the whole people whilst those execution which originate with a prince offend the individual only during the rioting between the cancellieri and panciatichi faction in and and of all prince it be impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty owe to new state be full of danger hence virgil through the mouth of dido excuse the inhumanity of her reign owe to it be new say re dura et regni novitas me talia cogunt moliri et late fine custode tueri nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act nor should he himself show fear but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable against my will my fate a throne unsettled and an infant state bid me defend my realm with all my powrs and guard with these severity my shore christopherpitt upon this a question arise whether it be well to be love than fear or fear than love it may be answer that one should wish to be both but because it be difficult to unite them in one person it be much safe to be fear than love when of the two either must be dispense with because this be to be assert in general of men that they be ungrateful fickle false cowardly covetous and as long a you succeed they be yours entirely they will offer you their blood property life and child a be say above when the need be far distant but when it approach they turn against you and that prince who rely entirely on their promise have neglect other precaution be ruin because friendship that be obtain by payment and not by greatness or nobility of mind may indeed be earn but they be not secure and in time of need can not be rely upon and men have less scruple in offend one who be beloved than one who be fear for love be preserve by the link of obligation which owe to the baseness of men be break at every opportunity for their advantage but fear preserve you by a dread of punishment which never fail nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that if he do not win love he avoids hatred because he can endure very well be fear whilst he be not hat which will always be as long a he abstain from the property of hi citizen and subject and from their woman but when it be necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause but above all thing he must keep hi hand off the property of other because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony besides pretext for take away the property be never want for he who have once begin to live by robbery will always find pretext for seize what belong to other but reason for take life on the contrary be more difficult to find and sooner lapse but when a prince be with hi army and have under control a multitude of soldier then it be quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty for without it he would never hold hi army unite or dispose to it duty among the wonderful deed of hannibal this one be enumerate that have lead an enormous army compose of many various race of men to fight in foreign land no dissension arise either among them or against the prince whether in hi bad or in hi good fortune this arose from nothing els than hi inhuman cruelty which with hi boundless valour make him revered and terrible in the sight of hi soldier but without that cruelty hi other virtue be not sufficient to produce this effect and shortsighted writer admire hi deed from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them that it be true hi other virtue would not have be sufficient for him may be prove by the case of scipio that most excellent man not only of hi own time but within the memory of man against whom nevertheless hi army rebel in spain this arose from nothing but hi too great forbearance which give hi soldier more license than be consistent with military discipline for this he be upbraid in the senate by fabius maximus and call the corrupter of the roman soldiery the locrians be lay waste by a legate of scipio yet they be not avenge by him nor be the insolence of the legate punish owe entirely to hi easy nature insomuch that someone in the senate wishing to excuse him say there be many men who know much good how not to err than to correct the error of other this disposition if he have be continue in the command would have destroy in time the fame and glory of scipio but he be under the control of the senate this injurious characteristic not only conceal itself but contribute to hi glory return to the question of be fear or love i come to the conclusion that men love accord to their own will and fear accord to that of the prince a wise prince should establish himself on that which be in hi own control and not in that of other he must endeavour only to avoid hatred a be note chapter xviii concerning the way in which prince should keep faith the present chapter have give great offence than any other portion of machiavelli writing burd il principe p every one admit how praiseworthy it be in a prince to keep faith and to live with integrity and not with craft nevertheless our experience have be that those prince who have do great thing have hold good faith of little account and have know how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft and in the end have overcome those who have rely on their word you must know there be two way of contestingthe one by the law the other by force the first method be proper to men the second to beast but because the first be frequently not sufficient it be necessary to have recourse to the second therefore it be necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man this have be figuratively taught to prince by ancient writer who describe how achilles and many other prince of old be give to the centaur chiron to nurse who bring them up in hi discipline which mean solely that a they have for a teacher one who be half beast and half man so it be necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both nature and that one without the other be not durable a prince therefore be compel knowingly to adopt the beast ought to choose the fox and the lion because the lion can not defend himself against snare and the fox can not defend himself against wolf therefore it be necessary to be a fox to discover the snare and a lion to terrify the wolf those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they be about therefore a wise lord can not nor ought he to keep faith when such observance may be turn against him and when the reason that cause him to pledge it exist no longer if men be entirely good this precept would not hold but because they be bad and will not keep faith with you you too be not bind to observe it with them nor will there ever be want to a prince legitimate reason to excuse this nonobservance of this endless modern example could be give show how many treaty and engagement have be make void and of no effect through the faithlessness of prince and he who have know best how to employ the fox have succeed best contest ie strive for mastery mr burd point out that this passage be imitate directly from cicero de officiis nam cum sint duo genus decertandi unum per disceptationem alterum per vim cumque illud proprium sit hominis hoc beluarum confugiendum est ad posterius si uti non licet superior but it be necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic and to be a great pretender and dissembler and men be so simple and so subject to present necessity that he who seek to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceive one recent example i can not pass over in silence alexander the sixth do nothing els but deceive men nor ever think of do otherwise and he always find victim for there never be a man who have great power in assert or who with great oath would affirm a thing yet would observe it less nevertheless hi deceit always succeed accord to hi wishesbecause he well understood this side of mankind nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni ad votum the word ad votum be omit in the testina addition alexander never do what he say cesare never say what he do italianproverb therefore it be unnecessary for a prince to have all the good quality i have enumerate but it be very necessary to appear to have them and i shall dare to say this also that to have them and always to observe them be injurious and that to appear to have them be useful to appear merciful faithful humane religious upright and to be so but with a mind so frame that should you require not to be so you may be able and know how to change to the opposite and you have to understand this that a prince especially a new one can not observe all those thing for which men be esteem be often force in order to maintain the state to act contrary to fidelityfriendship humanity and religion therefore it be necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly a the wind and variation of fortune force it yet a i have say above not to diverge from the good if he can avoid do so but if compel then to know how to set about it contrary to fidelity or faith contro alla fede and tutto fede altogether faithful in the next paragraph it be noteworthy that these two phrase contro alla fede and tutto fede be omit in the testina edition which be publish with the sanction of the papal authority it may be that the meaning attach to the word fede be the faith ie the catholic creed and not a render here fidelity and faithful observe that the word religion be suffer to stand in the text of the testina be use to signify indifferently every shade of belief a witness the religion a phrase inevitably employ to designate the huguenot heresy south in hi sermon ix p ed comment on this passage a follow that great patron and coryphaeus of this tribe nicolo machiavel lay down this for a master rule in hi political scheme that the show of religion be helpful to the politician but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious for this reason a prince ought to take care that he never let anything slip from hi lip that be not replete with the abovenamed five quality that he may appear to him who see and hear him altogether merciful faithful humane upright and religious there be nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality inasmuch a men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand because it belong to everybody to see you to few to come in touch with you every one see what you appear to be few really know what you be and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the majesty of the state to defend them and in the action of all men and especially of prince which it be not prudent to challenge one judge by the result for that reason let a prince have the credit of conquer and hold hi state the mean will always be consider honest and he will be praise by everybody because the vulgar be always take by what a thing seem to be and by what come of it and in the world there be only the vulgar for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on one princeof the present time whom it be not well to name never preaches anything els but peace and good faith and to both he be most hostile and either if he have keep it would have deprive him of reputation and kingdom many a time ferdinand of aragon when machiavelli be write the prince it would have be clearly impossible to mention ferdinand name here without give offence burds il principe p chapter xix that one should avoid being despised and hated now concern the characteristic of which mention be make above i have speak of the more important one the other i wish to discuss briefly under this generality that the prince must consider a have be in part say before how to avoid those thing which will make him hat or contemptible and as often a he shall have succeed he will have fulfil hi part and he need not fear any danger in other reproach it make him hat above all thing a i have say to be rapacious and to be a violator of the property and woman of hi subject from both of which he must abstain and when neither their property nor their honor be touch the majority of men live content and he have only to contend with the ambition of a few whom he can curb with ease in many way it make him contemptible to be consider fickle frivolous effeminate meanspirited irresolute from all of which a prince should guard himself a from a rock and he should endeavour to show in hi action greatness courage gravity and fortitude and in hi private dealing with hi subject let him show that hi judgment be irrevocable and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him that prince be highly esteem who convey this impression of himself and he who be highly esteem be not easily conspire against for provided it be well know that he be an excellent man and revere by hi people he can only be attack with difficulty for this reason a prince ought to have two fear one from within on account of hi subject the other from without on account of external power from the latter he be defend by be well arm and have good ally and if he be well arm he will have good friend and affair will always remain quiet within when they be quiet without unless they should have be already disturb by conspiracy and even should affair outside be disturbed if he have carry out hi preparation and have live a i have say as long a he do not despair he will resist every attack a i say nabis the spartan do but concern hi subject when affair outside be disturb he have only to fear that they will conspire secretly from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoid be hat and despise and by keep the people satisfy with him which it be most necessary for him to accomplish a i say above at length and one of the most efficacious remedy that a prince can have against conspiracy be not to be hat and despise by the people for he who conspire against a prince always expect to please them by hi removal but when the conspirator can only look forward to offend them he will not have the courage to take such a course for the difficulty that confront a conspirator be infinite and a experience show many have be the conspiracy but few have be successful because he who conspire can not act alone nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believe to be malcontent and as soon a you have open your mind to a malcontent you have give him the material with which to content himself for by denounce you he can look for every advantage so that see the gain from this course to be assure and see the other to be doubtful and full of danger he must be a very rare friend or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince to keep faith with you and to reduce the matter into a small compass i say that on the side of the conspirator there be nothing but fear jealousy prospect of punishment to terrify him but on the side of the prince there be the majesty of the principality the law the protection of friend and the state to defend him so that add to all these thing the popular goodwill it be impossible that any one should be so rash a to conspire for whereas in general the conspirator have to fear before the execution of hi plot in this case he have also to fear the sequel to the crime because on account of it he have the people for an enemy and thus can not hope for any escape endless example could be give on this subject but i will be content with one brought to pass within the memory of our father messer annibale bentivogli who be prince in bologna grandfather of the present annibale have be murder by the canneschi who have conspire against him not one of hi family survive but messer giovanniwho be in childhood immediately after hi assassination the people rise and murder all the canneschi this sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of bentivogli enjoy in those day in bologna which be so great that although none remain there after the death of annibale who be able to rule the state the bolognese have information that there be one of the bentivogli family in florence who up to that time have be consider the son of a blacksmith sent to florence for him and give him the government of their city and it be rule by him until messer giovanni come in due course to the government giovanni bentivogli bear in bologna die at milan he rule bologna from to machiavelli strong condemnation of conspiracy may get it edge from hi own very recent experience february when he have be arrest and torture for hi alleged complicity in the boscoli conspiracy for this reason i consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracy of little account when hi people hold him in esteem but when it be hostile to him and bear hatred towards him he ought to fear everything and everybody and wellordered state and wise prince have take every care not to drive the noble to desperation and to keep the people satisfy and content for this be one of the most important object a prince can have among the best ordered and govern kingdom of our time be france and in it be find many good institution on which depend the liberty and security of the king of these the first be the parliament and it authority because he who found the kingdom know the ambition of the nobility and their boldness consider that a bit to their mouth would be necessary to hold them in and on the other side know the hatred of the people found in fear against the noble he wish to protect them yet he be not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king therefore to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the noble for favour the people and from the people for favour the noble he set up an arbiter who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the less without reproach to the king neither could you have a good or a more prudent arrangement or a great source of security to the king and kingdom from this one can draw another important conclusion that princes ought to leave affair of reproach to the management of other and keep those of grace in their own hand and further i consider that a prince ought to cherish the noble but not so a to make himself hat by the people it may appear perhaps to some who have examine the life and death of the roman emperor that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion see that some of them live nobly and show great quality of soul nevertheless they have lose their empire or have be kill by subject who have conspire against them wish therefore to answer these objection i will recall the character of some of the emperor and will show that the cause of their ruin be not different to those allege by me at the same time i will only submit for consideration those thing that be noteworthy to him who study the affair of those time it seem to me sufficient to take all those emperor who succeed to the empire from marcus the philosopher down to maximinus they be marcus and hi son commodus pertinax julian severus and hi son antoninus caracalla macrinus heliogabalus alexander and maximinus there be first to note that whereas in other principality the ambition of the noble and the insolence of the people only have to be contend with the roman emperor have a third difficulty in have to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldier a matter so beset with difficulty that it be the ruin of many for it be a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldier and people because the people love peace and for this reason they love the unaspiring prince whilst the soldier love the warlike prince who be bold cruel and rapacious which qualities they be quite willing he should exercise upon the people so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty hence it arise that those emperor be always overthrow who either by birth or training have no great authority and most of them especially those who come new to the principality recognize the difficulty of these two opposing humour be incline to give satisfaction to the soldier care little about injure the people which course be necessary because a prince can not help be hat by someone they ought in the first place to avoid be hat by every one and when they can not compass this they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful therefore those emperor who through inexperience have need of special favour adhere more readily to the soldier than to the people a course which turn out advantageous to them or not accordingly a the prince know how to maintain authority over them from these cause it arise that marcus pertinax and alexander be all men of modest life lover of justice enemy to cruelty humane and benignant come to a sad end except marcus he alone live and die honour because he have succeed to the throne by hereditary title and owe nothing either to the soldier or the people and afterwards be possess of many virtue which make him respect he always keep both order in their place whilst he live and be neither hat nor despise but pertinax be create emperor against the wish of the soldier who be accustom to live licentiously under commodus could not endure the honest life to which pertinax wish to reduce them thus have give cause for hatred to which hatred there be add contempt for hi old age he be overthrow at the very beginning of hi administration and here it should be note that hatred be acquire a much by good work a by bad one therefore a i say before a prince wish to keep hi state be very often force to do evil for when that body be corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourselfit may be either the people or the soldier or the noblesyou have to submit to it humour and to gratify them and then good work will do you harm but let u come to alexander who be a man of such great goodness that among the other praise which be accord him be this that in the fourteen year he hold the empire no one be ever put to death by him unjudged nevertheless be consider effeminate and a man who allow himself to be govern by hi mother he become despise the army conspire against him and murder him turn now to the opposite character of commodus severus antoninus caracalla and maximinus you will find them all cruel and rapacious men who to satisfy their soldier do not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people and all except severus come to a bad end but in severus there be so much valour that keep the soldier friendly although the people be oppress by him he reign successfully for hi valour make him so much admire in the sight of the soldier and people that the latter be keep in a way astonish and awe and the former respectful and satisfy and because the action of this man a a new prince be great i wish to show briefly that he know well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion which natures a i say above it be necessary for a prince to imitate know the sloth of the emperor julian he persuade the army in sclavonia of which he be captain that it would be right to go to romeand avenge the death of pertinax who have be kill by the praetorian soldier and under this pretext without appear to aspire to the throne he move the army on romeand reach italy before it be know that he have start on hi arrival at romethe senate through fear elect him emperor and kill julian after this there remain for severus who wish to make himself master of the whole empire two difficulty one in asia where niger head of the asiatic army have cause himself to be proclaim emperor the other in the west where albinus be who also aspire to the throne and a he consider it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both he decide to attack niger and to deceive albinus to the latter he write that be elect emperor by the senate he be willing to share that dignity with him and send him the title of caesar and moreover that the senate have make albinus hi colleague which thing be accept by albinus a true but after severus have conquer and kill niger and settle oriental affair he return to romeand complain to the senate that albinus little recognize the benefit that he have receive from him have by treachery seek to murder him and for this ingratitude he be compel to punish him afterwards he seek him out in france and take from him hi government and life he who will therefore carefully examine the action of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox he will find him feared and respect by every one and not hat by the army and it need not be wonder at that he a new man be able to hold the empire so well because hi supreme renown always protect him from that hatred which the people might have conceive against him for hi violence but hi son antoninus be a most eminent man and have very excellent quality which make him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldier for he be a warlike man most enduring of fatigue a despiser of all delicate food and other luxury which cause him to be beloved by the army nevertheless hi ferocity and cruelty be so great and so unheard of that after endless single murder he kill a large number of the people of romeand all those of alexandria he become hat by the whole world and also fear by those he have around him to such an extent that he be murder in the midst of hi army by a centurion and here it must be note that such like death which be deliberately inflict with a resolve and desperate courage can not be avoid by prince because any one who do not fear to die can inflict them but a prince may fear them the less because they be very rare he have only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employ or have around him in the service of the state antoninus have not take this care but have contumeliously kill a brother of that centurion whom also he daily threaten yet retain in hi bodyguard which a it turn out be a rash thing to do and prove the emperor ruin but let u come to commodus to whom it should have be very easy to hold the empire for be the son of marcus he have inherit it and he have only to follow in the footstep of hi father to please hi people and soldier but be by nature cruel and brutal he give himself up to amuse the soldier and corrupt them so that he might indulge hi rapacity upon the people on the other hand not maintain hi dignity often descend to the theatre to compete with gladiator and do other vile thing little worthy of the imperial majesty he fell into contempt with the soldier and be hat by one party and despise by the other he be conspire against and be kill it remain to discuss the character of maximinus he be a very warlike man and the army be disgust with the effeminacy of alexander of whom i have already speak kill him and elect maximinus to the throne this he do not possess for long for two thing make him hated and despise the one hi have keep sheep in thrace which bring him into contempt it be well know to all and consider a great indignity by every one and the other hi have at the accession to hi dominion defer go to romeand take possession of the imperial seat he have also gain a reputation for the utmost ferocity by have through hi prefect in romeand elsewhere in the empire practise many cruelty so that the whole world be move to anger at the meanness of hi birth and to fear at hi barbarity first africa rebel then the senate with all the people of romeand all italy conspire against him to which may be add hi own army this latter besieging aquileia and meet with difficulty in take it be disgust with hi cruelty and fear him less when they find so many against him murder him i do not wish to discuss heliogabalus macrinus or julian who be thoroughly contemptible be quickly wipe out but i will bring this discourse to a conclusion by say that prince in our time have this difficulty of give inordinate satisfaction to their soldier in a far less degree because notwithstanding one have to give them some indulgence that be soon do none of these prince have army that be veteran in the governance and administration of province a be the army of the roman empire and whereas it be then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldier than to the people it be now more necessary to all prince except the turk and the soldan to satisfy the people rather the soldier because the people be the more powerful from the above i have except the turk who always keep round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom and it be necessary that put aside every consideration for the people he should keep them hi friends the kingdom of the soldan be similar be entirely in the hand of soldier it follow again that without regard to the people he must keep them hi friend but you must note that the state of the soldan be unlike all other principality for the reason that it be like the christian pontificate which can not be call either an hereditary or a newly form principality because the son of the old prince be not the heir but he who be elect to that position by those who have authority and the son remain only nobleman and this be an ancient custom it can not be call a new principality because there be none of those difficulty in it that be meet with in new one for although the prince be new the constitution of the state be old and it be frame so a to receive him a if he be it hereditary lord but return to the subject of our discourse i say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt have be fatal to the abovenamed emperor and it will be recognize also how it happen that a number of them act in one way and a number in another only one in each way come to a happy end and the rest to unhappy one because it would have be useless and dangerous for pertinax and alexander be new prince to imitate marcus who be heir to the principality and likewise it would have be utterly destructive to caracalla commodus and maximinus to have imitate severus they not have sufficient valour to enable them to tread in hi footstep therefore a prince new to the principality can not imitate the action of marcus nor again be it necessary to follow those of severus but he ought to take from severus those part which be necessary to find hi state and from marcus those which be proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm chapter xx are fortress and many other thing to which prince often resort advantageous or hurtful some prince so a to hold securely the state have disarm their subject other have keep their subject town distract by faction other have foster enmity against themselves other have lay themselves out to gain over those whom they distrust in the beginning of their government some have build fortress some have overthrow and destroy them and although one can not give a final judgment on all of these thing unless one possess the particular of those state in which a decision have to be make nevertheless i will speak as comprehensively a the matter of itself will admit there never be a new prince who have disarm hi subject rather when he have find them disarm he have always arm them because by arm them those arm become yours those men who be distrust become faithful and those who be faithful be keep so and your subject become your adherent and whereas all subject can not be arm yet when those whom you do arm be benefit the other can be handle more freely and this difference in their treatment which they quite understand make the former your dependent and the latter consider it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward excuse you but when you disarm them you at once offend them by show that you distrust them either for cowardice or for want of loyalty and either of these opinion breed hatred against you and because you can not remain unarmed it follow that you turn to mercenary which be of the character already show even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemy and distrusted subject therefore a i have say a new prince in a new principality have always distribute arm history be full of example but when a prince acquire a new state which he add a a province to hi old one then it be necessary to disarm the men of that state except those who have be hi adherent in acquire it and these again with time and opportunity should be render soft and effeminate and matter should be manage in such a way that all the arm men in the state shall be your own soldier who in your old state be live near you our forefather and those who be reckon wise be accustom to say that it be necessary to hold pistoia by faction and pisa by fortress and with this idea they foster quarrel in some of their tributary town so a to keep possession of them the more easily this may have be well enough in those time when italy be in a way balance but i do not believe that it can be accept a a precept for today because i do not believe that faction can ever be of use rather it be certain that when the enemy come upon you in divide city you be quickly lose because the weak party will always assist the outside force and the other will not be able to resist the venetian move a i believe by the above reason foster the guelph and ghibelline faction in their tributary city and although they never allow them to come to bloodshed yet they nurse these dispute amongst them so that the citizen distract by their difference should not unite against them which a we saw do not afterwards turn out a expect because after the rout at vaila one party at once take courage and seize the state such method argue therefore weakness in the prince because these faction will never be permit in a vigorous principality such method for enable one the more easily to manage subject be only useful in time of peace but if war come this policy prove fallacious without doubt prince become great when they overcome the difficulty and obstacle by which they be confront and therefore fortune especially when she desire to make a new prince great who have a great necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one cause enemy to arise and form design against him in order that he may have the opportunity of overcome them and by them to mount high a by a ladder which hi enemy have raise for this reason many consider that a wise prince when he have the opportunity ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself so that have crush it hi renown may rise high prince especially new one have find more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule be distrust than among those who in the beginning be trust pandolfo petrucci prince of siena rule hi state more by those who have be distrust than by other but on this question one can not speak generally for it vary so much with the individual i will only say this that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have be hostile if they be of a description to need assistance to support themselves can always be gain over with the great ease and they will be tightly hold to serve the prince with fidelity inasmuch a they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deed the bad impression which he have form of them and thus the prince always extract more profit from them than from those who serve him in too much security may neglect hi affair and since the matter demand it i must not fail to warn a prince who by mean of secret favour have acquire a new state that he must well consider the reason which induce those to favour him who do so and if it be not a natural affection towards him but only discontent with their government then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty for it will be impossible to satisfy them and weigh well the reason for this in those example which can be take from ancient and modern affair we shall find that it be easy for the prince to make friend of those men who be content under the former government and be therefore hi enemy than of those who be discontent with it be favourable to him and encourage him to seize it it have be a custom with prince in order to hold their state more securely to build fortress that may serve a a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them and a a place of refuge from a first attack i praise this system because it have be make use of formerly notwithstanding that messer nicolo vitellus in our time have be see to demolish two fortress in citta di castello so that he might keep that state guido ubaldo duke of urbino on return to hi dominion whence he have be drive by cesare borgia raze to the foundation all the fortress in that province and consider that without them it would be more difficult to lose it the bentivogli return to bologna come to a similar decision fortress therefore be useful or not accord to circumstance if they do you good in one way they injure you in another and this question can be reason thus the prince who have more to fear from the people than from foreigner ought to build fortress but he who have more to fear from foreigner than from the people ought to leave them alone the castle of milan build by francesco sforza have make and will make more trouble for the house of sforza than any other disorder in the state for this reason the best possible fortress isnot to be hat by the people because although you may hold the fortress yet they will not save you if the people hate you for there will never be want foreigner to assist a people who have take arm against you it have not be see in our time that such fortress have be of use to any prince unless to the countess of forliwhen the count girolamo her consort be kill for by that mean she be able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from milan and thus recover her state and the posture of affair be such at that time that the foreigner could not assist the people but fortress be of little value to her afterwards when cesare borgia attack her and when the people her enemy be ally with foreigner therefore it would have be safe for her both then and before not to have be hat by the people than to have have the fortress all these thing consider then i shall praise him who build fortress as well a him who do not and i shall blame whoever trust in them care little about be hat by the people catherine sforza a daughter of galeazzo sforza and lucrezia landriani bear die it be to the countess of forli that machiavelli be send a envy on a letter from fortunati to the countess announce the appointment i have be with the signori write fortunati to learn whom they would send and when they tell me that nicolo machiavelli a learned young florentine noble secretary to my lord of the ten be to leave with me at once cf catherine sforza by count pasolini translate by p sylvester chapter xxi how a prince should conduct himself so a to gain renown nothing make a prince so much esteem a great enterprise and set a fine example we have in our time ferdinand of aragon the present king of spain he can almost be call a new prince because he have rise by fame and glory from be an insignificant king to be the foremost king in christendom and if you will consider hi deed you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary in the beginning of hi reign he attack granada and this enterprise be the foundation of hi dominion he do this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance for he hold the mind of the baron of castile occupy in thinking of the war and not anticipate any innovation thus they do not perceive that by these mean he be acquire power and authority over them he be able with the money of the church and of the people to sustain hi army and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which have since distinguish him further always use religion a a plea so a to undertake great scheme he devote himself with pious cruelty to drive out and clear hi kingdom of the moor nor could there be a more admirable example nor one more rare under this same cloak he assail africa he come down on italy he have finally attack france and thus hi achievement and design have always be great and have keep the mind of hi people in suspense and admiration and occupy with the issue of them and hi action have arise in such a way one out of the other that men have never be give time to work steadily against him again it much assist a prince to set unusual example in internal affair similar to those which be relate of messer bernabo da milano who when he have the opportunity by any one in civil life do some extraordinary thing either good or bad would take some method of reward or punish him which would be much speak about and a prince ought above all thing always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of be a great and remarkable man a prince be also respect when he be either a true friend or a downright enemy that be to say when without any reservation he declare himself in favour of one party against the other which course will always be more advantageous than stand neutral because if two of your powerful neighbour come to blow they be of such a character that if one of them conquers you have either to fear him or not in either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously because in the first case if you do not declare yourself you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who have be conquer and you will have no reason to offer nor anything to protect or to shelter you because he who conquer do not want doubtful friend who will not aid him in the time of trial and he who lose will not harbour you because you do not willingly sword in hand court hi fate antiochus go into greece be send for by the aetolians to drive out the roman he send envoys to the achaean who be friend of the roman exhort them to remain neutral and on the other hand the roman urge them to take up arm this question come to be discuss in the council of the achaean where the legate of antiochus urge them to stand neutral to this the roman legate answer a for that which have be say that it be well and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war nothing can be more erroneous because by not interfere you will be leave without favour or consideration the guerdon of the conqueror thus it will always happen that he who be not your friend will demand your neutrality whilst he who be your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arm and irresolute prince to avoid present danger generally follow the neutral path and be generally ruin but when a prince declare himself gallantly in favour of one side if the party with whom he ally himself conquers although the victor may be powerful and may have him at hi mercy yet he be indebted to him and there be establish a bond of amity and men be never so shameless a to become a monument of ingratitude by oppress you victory after all be never so complete that the victor must not show some regard especially to justice but if he with whom you ally yourself lose you may be shelter by him and whilst he be able he may aid you and you become companion on a fortune that may rise again in the second case when those who fight be of such a character that you have no anxiety a to who may conquer so much the more be it great prudence to be ally because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who if he have be wise would have save him and conquer a it be impossible that he should not do with your assistance he remain at your discretion and here it be to be note that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purpose of attack other unless necessity compels him a be say above because if he conquer you be at hi discretion and prince ought to avoid as much a possible be at the discretion of any one the venetian join with france against the duke of milan and this alliance which cause their ruin could have be avoid but when it can not be avoid as happen to the florentine when the pope and spain send army to attack lombardy then in such a case for the above reason the prince ought to favour one of the party never let any government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe course rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful one because it be find in ordinary affair that one never seek to avoid one trouble without run into another but prudence consist in know how to distinguish the character of trouble and for choice to take the less evil a prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability and to honour the proficient in every art at the same time he should encourage hi citizen to practise their calling peaceably both in commerce and agriculture and in every other follow so that the one should not be deter from improve hi possession for fear l they be take away from him or another from open up trade for fear of tax but the prince ought to offer reward to whoever wish to do these thing and design in any way to honour hi city or state far he ought to entertain the people with festival and spectacle at convenient season of the year and a every city be divide into guild or into societieshe ought to hold such body in esteem and associate with them sometimes and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality nevertheless always maintain the majesty of hi rank for this he must never consent to abate in anything guild or society in arti o in tribu arti be craft or trade guild cf florio art a whole company of any trade in any city or corporation town the guild of florence be most admirably describe by mr edgcumbe staley in hi work on the subject methuen institution of a somewhat similar character call rotl exist in russia today cf sir mackenzie wallace russia ed the son be always during the work season member of an rotl in some of the large town there be artel of a much more complex kind permanent association possess large capital and pecuniarily responsible for the act of the individual member the word artel despite it apparent similarity have mr aylmer maude assure me no connection with ar or art it root be that of the verb rotisya to bind oneself by an oath and it be generally admit to be only another form of rota which now signify a regimental company in both word the underlying idea be that of a body of men unite by an oath tribu be possibly gentile group unite by common descent and included individual connect by marriage perhaps our word sept or clan would be most appropriate chapter xxii concerning the secretary of prince the choice of servant be of no little importance to a prince and they be good or not accord to the discrimination of the prince and the first opinion which one form of a prince and of hi understanding be by observe the men he have around him and when they be capable and faithful he may always be consider wise because he have know how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful but when they be otherwise one can not form a good opinion of him for the prime error which he make be in choose them there be none who know messer antonio da venafro a the servant of pandolfo petrucci prince of siena who would not consider pandolfo to be a very clever man in have venafro for hi servant because there be three class of intellect one which comprehend by itself another which appreciate what other comprehend and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of other the first be the most excellent the second be good the third be useless therefore it follow necessarily that if pandolfo be not in the first rank he be in the second for whenever one have judgment to know good and bad when it be say and do although he himself may not have the initiative yet he can recognize the good and the bad in hi servant and the one he can praise and the other correct thus the servant can not hope to deceive him and be keep honest but to enable a prince to form an opinion of hi servant there be one test which never fail when you see the servant thinking more of hi own interest than of yours and seek inwardly hi own profit in everything such a man will never make a good servant nor will you ever be able to trust him because he who have the state of another in hi hand ought never to think of himself but always of hi prince and never pay any attention to matter in which the prince be not concern on the other hand to keep hi servant honest the prince ought to study him honour him enrich him do him kindnesses share with him the honour and care and at the same time let him see that he can not stand alone so that many honour may not make him desire more many rich make him wish for more and that many care may make him dread chance when therefore servant and prince towards servant be thus dispose they can trust each other but when it be otherwise the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other chapter xxiii how flatterer should be avoided i do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject for it be a danger from which prince be with difficulty preserve unless they be very careful and discriminate it be that of flatterer of whom court be full because men be so selfcomplacent in their own affair and in a way so deceive in them that they be preserve with difficulty from this pest and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of fall into contempt because there be no other way of guard oneself from flatterer except let men understand that to tell you the truth do not offend you but when every one may tell you the truth respect for you abate therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choose the wise men in hi state and give to them only the liberty of speak the truth to him and then only of those thing of which he inquire and of none other but he ought to question them upon everything and listen to their opinion and afterwards form hi own conclusion with these councillor separately and collectively he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that the more freely he shall speak the more he shall be prefer outside of these he should listen to no one pursue the thing resolve on and be steadfast in hi resolution he who do otherwise be either overthrown by flatterer or be so often change by vary opinion that he fall into contempt i wish on this subject to adduce a modern example fra luca the man of affair to maximilianthe present emperor speaking of hi majesty say he consult with no one yet never get hi own way in anything this arose because of hi follow a practice the opposite to the above for the emperor be a secretive manhe do not communicate hi design to any one nor do he receive opinion on them but a in carry them into effect they become revealed and know they be at once obstruct by those men whom he have around him and he be pliant be divert from them hence it follow that those thing he do one day he undo the next and no one ever understand what he wish or intend to do and no one can rely on hi resolution maximilian i bear in died emperor of the holy roman empire he marry first mary daughter of charles the bold after her death bianca sforza and thus become involve in italian politics a prince therefore ought always to take counsel but only when he wish and not when other wish he ought rather to discourage every one from offer advice unless he ask it but however he ought to be a constant inquirer and afterwards a patient listener concern the thing of which he inquire also on learn that nay one on any consideration have not tell him the truth he should let hi anger be felt and if there be some who think that a prince who convey an impression of hi wisdom be not so through hi own ability but through the good adviser that he have around him beyond doubt they be deceive because this be an axiom which never fail that a prince who be not wise himself will never take good advice unless by chance he have yield hi affair entirely to one person who happen to be a very prudent man in this case indeed he may be well govern but it would not be for long because such a governor would in a short time take away hi state from him but if a prince who be not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsel nor will he know how to unite them each of the counsellor will think of hi own interest and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them and they be not to find otherwise because men will always prove untrue to you unless they be keep honest by constraint therefore it must be infer that good counsel whencesoever they come be bear of the wisdom of the prince and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsel chapter xxiv why the prince of italy have lost their state the previous suggestion carefully observe will enable a new prince to appear well establish and render him at once more secure and fix in the state than if he have be long seat there for the action of a new prince be more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one and when they be see to be able they gain more men and bind far tight than ancient blood because men be attract more by the present than by the past and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fail them not in other thing thus it will be a double glory for him to have establish a new principality and adorn and strengthen it with good law good arm good ally and with a good example so will it be a double disgrace to him who bear a prince shall lose hi state by want of wisdom and if those seignior be consider who have lose their state in italy in our time such a the king of naples the duke of milan and other there will be find in them firstly one common defect in regard to arm from the cause which have be discuss at length in the next place some one of them will be see either to have have the people hostile or if he have have the people friendly he have not know how to secure the noble in the absence of these defect state that have power enough to keep an army in the field can not be lose philip of macedon not the father of alexander the great but he who be conquer by titus quintius have not much territory compare to the greatness of the roman and of greece who attack him yet be a warlike man who know how to attract the people and secure the noble he sustain the war against hi enemy for many year and if in the end he lose the dominion of some city nevertheless he retain the kingdom therefore do not let our prince accuse fortune for the loss of their principality after so many year possession but rather their own sloth because in quiet time they never think there could be a change it be a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest and when afterwards the bad time come they think of flight and not of defend themselves and they hop that the people disgust with the insolence of the conqueror would recall them this course when other fail may be good but it be very bad to have neglect all other expedient for that since you would never wish to fall because you trust to be able to find someone later on to restore you this again either do not happen or if it do it will not be for your security because that deliverance be of no avail which do not depend upon yourself those only be reliable certain and durable that depend on yourself and your valour chapter xxv what fortune can effect in human affair and how to withstand her it be not unknown to me how many men have have and still have the opinion that the affair of the world be in such wise govern by fortune and by god that men with their wisdom can not direct them and that no one can even help them and because of this they would have u believe that it be not necessary to labour much in affair but to let chance govern them this opinion have be more credited in our time because of the great change in affair which have be see and may still be see every day beyond all human conjecture sometimes ponder over this i be in some degree incline to their opinion nevertheless not to extinguish our free will i hold it to be true that fortune be the arbiter of onehalf of our actionsbut that she still leave u to direct the other half or perhaps a little less frederick the great be accustom to say the old one get the more convinced one become that hi majesty king chance do threequarters of the business of this miserable universe sorels eastern question i compare her to one of those rag river which when in flood overflow the plain sweep away tree and building bear away the soil from place to place everything fly before it all yield to it violence without be able in any way to withstand it and yet though it nature be such it do not follow therefore that men when the weather become fair shall not make provision both with defence and barrier in such a manner that rise again the water may pass away by canal and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous so it happen with fortune who show her power where valour have not prepare to resist her and thither she turn her force where she know that barrier and defence have not be raise to constrain her and if you will consider italy which be the seat of these change and which have give to them their impulse you will see it to be an open country without barrier and without any defence for if it have be defend by proper valour a be germany spain and france either this invasion would not have make the great change it have make or it would not have come at all and this i consider enough to say concern resistance to fortune in general but confine myself more to the particular i say that a prince may be see happy today and ruin tomorrow without have show any change of disposition or character this i believe arises firstly from cause that have already be discuss at length namely that the prince who rely entirely on fortune be lose when it change i believe also that he will be successful who direct hi action accord to the spirit of the time and that he whose action do not accord with the time will not be successful because men be see in affair that lead to the end which every man have before him namely glory and rich to get there by various method one with caution another with haste one by force another by skill one by patience another by it opposite and each one succeed in reach the goal by a different method one can also see of two cautious men the one attain hi end the other fail and similarly two men by different observance be equally successful the one be cautious the other impetuous all this arise from nothing els than whether or not they conform in their method to the spirit of the time this follow from what i have say that two men work differently bring about the same effect and of two work similarly one attain hi object and the other do not change in estate also issue from this for if to one who govern himself with caution and patience time and affair converge in such a way that hi administration be successful hi fortune be make but if time and affair change he be ruin if he do not change hi course of action but a man be not often find sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change both because he can not deviate from what nature incline him to do and also because have always prosper by act in one way he can not be persuade that it be well to leave it and therefore the cautious man when it be time to turn adventurous do not know how to do it hence he be ruin but have he change hi conduct with the time fortune would not have change pope julius the second go to work impetuously in all hi affair and find the time and circumstance conform so well to that line of action that he always meet with success consider hi first enterprise against bologna messer giovanni bentivogli be still alive the venetian be not agreeable to it nor be the king of spain and he have the enterprise still under discussion with the king of france nevertheless he personally enter upon the expedition with hi accustomed boldness and energy a move which make spain and the venetian stand irresolute and passive the latter from fear the former from desire to recover the kingdom of naples on the other hand he draw after him the king of france because that king have observe the movement and desire to make the pope hi friend so a to humble the venetian find it impossible to refuse him therefore julius with hi impetuous action accomplish what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have do for if he have wait in romeuntil he could get away with hi plan arrange and everything fix a any other pontiff would have do he would never have succeed because the king of france would have make a thousand excuse and the other would have raise a thousand fear i will leave hi other action alone a they be all alike and they all succeed for the shortness of hi life do not let him experience the contrary but if circumstance have arise which require him to go cautiously hi ruin would have follow because he would never have deviate from those way to which nature incline him i conclude therefore that fortune be changeful and mankind steadfast in their way so long a the two be in agreement men be successful but unsuccessful when they fall out for my part i consider that it be well to be adventurous than cautious because fortune be a woman and if you wish to keep her under it be necessary to beat and illuse her and it be see that she allow herself to be master by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly she be therefore always womanlike a lover of young men because they be less cautious more violent and with more audacity command her chapter xxvi an exhortation to liberate italy from the barbarian having carefully consider the subject of the above discourse and wonder within myself whether the present time be propitious to a new prince and whether there be element that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of thing which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country it appear to me that so many thing concur to favour a new prince that i never know a time more fit than the present and if a i say it be necessary that the people of israel should be captive so a to make manifest the ability of moses that the persian should be oppress by the medes so a to discover the greatness of the soul of cyrus and that the athenian should be disperse to illustrate the capability of theseus then at the present time in order to discover the virtue of an italian spirit it be necessary that italy should be reduce to the extremity that she be now in that she should be more enslaved than the hebrew more oppressed than the persian more scattered than the athenian without head without order beaten despoil torn overrun and to have endure every kind of desolation although lately some spark may have be show by one which make u think he be ordain by god for our redemption nevertheless it be afterwards see in the height of hi career that fortune reject him so that italy leave a without life wait for him who shall yet heal her wound and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of lombardy to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of tuscany and cleanse those sore that for long have fester it be see how she entreat god to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrong and barbarous insolencies it be see also that she be ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it nor be there to be see at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious housewith it valour and fortune favour by god and by the church of which it be now the chief and which could be make the head of this redemption this will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the action and life of the men i have name and although they be great and wonderful men yet they be men and each one of them have no more opportunity than the present offer for their enterprise be neither more just nor easy than this nor be god more their friend than he be yours giuliano de medici he have just be create a cardinal by leo x in giuliano be elect pope and take the title of clement vii with u there be great justice because that war be just which be necessary and arm be hallow when there be no other hope but in them here there be the great willingness and where the willingness be great the difficulty can not be great if you will only follow those men to whom i have direct your attention far than this how extraordinarily the way of god have be manifest beyond example the sea be divide a cloud have lead the way the rock have pour forth water it have rain manna everything have contribute to your greatness you ought to do the rest god be not willing to do everything and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belong to u and it be not to be wonder at if none of the abovenamed italian have be able to accomplish all that be expect from your illustrious house and if in so many revolution in italy and in so many campaign it have always appear a if military virtue be exhaust this have happen because the old order of thing be not good and none of u have know how to find a new one and nothing honour a man more than to establish new law and new ordinance when he himself be newly rise such thing when they be well found and dignify will make him revered and admired and in italy there be not want opportunity to bring such into use in every form here there be great valour in the limb whilst it fail in the head look attentively at the duel and the handtohand combat how superior the italian be in strength dexterity and subtlety but when it come to army they do not bear comparison and this spring entirely from the insufficiency of the leader since those who be capable be not obedient and each one seem to himself to know there have never be any one so distinguish above the rest either by valour or fortune that other would yield to him hence it be that for so long a time and during so much fighting in the past twenty year whenever there have be an army wholly italian it have always give a poor account of itself the first witness to this be il taro afterwards allesandria capua genoa vaila bologna mestri the battle of il taro alessandria capua genoa vaila bologna mestri if therefore your illustrious house wish to follow these remarkable men who have redeem their country it be necessary before all thing a a true foundation for every enterprise to be provide with your own force because there can be no more faithful truer or good soldier and although singly they be good altogether they will be much good when they find themselves command by their prince honour by him and maintain at hi expense therefore it be necessary to be prepare with such arm so that you can be defend against foreigner by italian valour and although swiss and spanish infantry may be consider very formidable nevertheless there be a defect in both by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them but might be rely upon to overthrow them for the spaniard can not resist cavalry and the switzers be afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat owe to this a have be and may again be see the spaniard be unable to resist french cavalry and the switzers be overthrow by spanish infantry and although a complete proof of this latter can not be show nevertheless there be some evidence of it at the battle of ravenna when the spanish infantry be confront by german battalion who follow the same tactic a the swiss when the spaniard by agility of body and with the aid of their shield get in under the pike of the german and stand out of danger able to attack while the german stand helpless and if the cavalry have not dash up all would have be over with them it be possible therefore know the defect of both these infantry to invent a new one which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry this need not create a new order of arm but a variation upon the old and these be the kind of improvement which confer reputation and power upon a new prince this opportunity therefore ought not to be allow to pass for let italy at last see her liberator appear nor can one express the love with which he would be receive in all those province which have suffer so much from these foreign scouring with what thirst for revenge with what stubborn faith with what devotion with what tear what door would be close to him who would refuse obedience to him what envy would hinder him what italian would refuse him homage to all of u this barbarous dominion stink let therefore your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprise be undertake so that under it standard our native country may be ennoble and under it auspex may be verify that say of petrarch virtu contro al furore prendera larme e fia il combatter corto che lantico valor negli italici cuor non e ancor morto virtue against fury shall advance the fight and it i th combat soon shall put to flight for the old roman valour be not dead nor in th italian brest extinguish edward dacre description of the method adopted by the duke valentino when murdering vitellozzo vitellus oliverotto da fermo the signor pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini by nicolmachiavelli the duke valentino have return from lombardy where he have be to clear himself with the king of france from the calumny which have be raise against him by the florentine concern the rebellion of arezzo and other town in the val di chiana and have arrive at imola whence he intend with hi army to enter upon the campaign against giovanni bentivogli the tyrant of bologna for he intend to bring that city under hi domination and to make it the head of hi romagnian duchy these matter come to the knowledge of the vitellus and orsini and their follow it appear to them that the duke would become too powerful and it be fear that have seize bologna he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in italy upon this a meeting be call at magione in the district of perugia to which come the cardinal pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini vitellozzo vitellus oliverotto da fermo gianpagolo baglioni the tyrant of perugia and messer antonio da venafro sent by pandolfo petrucci the prince of siena here be discuss the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curb hi ambition which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of be ruin and they decide not to abandon the bentivogli but to strive to win over the florentine and they send their men to one place and another promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy this meeting be at once report throughout all italy and those who be discontent under the duke among whom be the people of urbino take hope of effect a revolution thus it arise that mens mind be thus unsettle it be decide by certain men of urbino to seize the fortress of san leo which be hold for the duke and which they capture by the following mean the castellan be fortify the rock and cause timber to be take there so the conspirator watch and when certain beam which be be carry to the rock be upon the bridge so that it be prevent from be draw up by those inside they take the opportunity of leap upon the bridge and thence into the fortress upon this capture be effect the whole state rebel and recall the old duke be encourage in this not so much by the capture of the fort a by the diet at magione from whom they expect to get assistance those who hear of the rebellion at urbino think they would not lose the opportunity and at once assemble their men so a to take any town should any remain in the hand of the duke in that state and they send again to florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroy the common firebrand show that the risk be lessen and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity but the florentine from hatred for sundry reason of the vitellus and orsini not only would not ally themselves but send nicolo machiavelli their secretary to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against hi enemy the duke be find full of fear at imola because against everybodys expectation hi soldier have at once go over to the enemy and he find himself disarmed and war at hi door but recover courage from the offer of the florentine he decide to temporize before fight with the few soldier that remain to him and to negotiate for a reconciliation and also to get assistance this latter he obtain in two way by send to the king of france for men and by enlist menatarms and other whom he turn into cavalry of a sort to all he give money notwithstanding this hi enemy draw near to him and approach fossombrone where they encounter some men of the duke and with the aid of the orsini and vitellus rout them when this happen the duke resolve at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offer of reconciliation and be a most perfect dissembler he do not fail in any practice to make the insurgent understand that he wish every man who have acquire anything to keep it a it be enough for him to have the title of prince whilst other might have the principality and the duke succeed so well in this that they send signor pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation and they bring their army to a standstill but the duke do not stop hi preparation and take every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry and that such preparation might not be apparent to the other he send hi troop in separate party to every part of the romagna in the meanwhile there come also to him five hundred french lancer and although he find himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on hi enemy in open war he consider that it would be safe and more advantageous to outwit them and for this reason he do not stop the work of reconciliation and that this might be effect the duke conclude a peace with them in which he confirm their former covenant he give them four thousand ducat at once he promise not to injure the bentivogli and he form an alliance with giovanni and moreover he would not force them to come personally into hi presence unless it please them to do so on the other hand they promise to restore to him the duchy of urbino and other place seize by them to serve him in all hi expedition and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without hi permission this reconciliation be complete guido ubaldo the duke of urbino again flee to venice have first destroy all the fortress in hi state because trust in the people he do not wish that the fortress which he do not think he could defend should be hold by the enemy since by these mean a check would be keep upon hi friend but the duke valentino have complete this convention and disperse hi men throughout the romagna set out for imola at the end of november together with hi french menatarms thence he go to cesena where he stay some time to negotiate with the envoy of the vitellus and orsini who have assemble with their men in the duchy of urbino a to the enterprise in which they should now take part but nothing be conclude oliverotto da fermo be send to propose that if the duke wish to undertake an expedition against tuscany they be ready if he do not wish it then they would besiege sinigalia to this the duke reply that he do not wish to enter into war with tuscany and thus become hostile to the florentine but that he be very willing to proceed against sinigalia it happen that not long afterwards the town surrender but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person therefore they exhort him to come there this appear a good opportunity to the duke a be invite by them and not go of hi own will he would awaken no suspicion and the more to reassure them he allow all the french menatarms who be with him in lombardy to depart except the hundred lancer under mon di candales hi brotherinlaw he leave cesena about the middle of december and go to fano and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuade the vitellus and orsini to wait for him at sinigalia point out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation and that he be a man who wish to make use of the arm and council of hi friend but vitellozzo remain very stubborn for the death of hi brother warn him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him nevertheless persuade by pagolo orsini whom the duke have corrupt with gift and promise he agree to wait upon this the duke before hi departure from fano which be to be on th december communicate hi design to eight of hi most trusted follower among whom be don michele and the monsignor deuna who be afterwards cardinal and he order that as soon a vitellozzo pagolo orsini the duke di gravina and oliverotto should arrive hi follower in pair should take them one by one entrust certain men to certain pair who should entertain them until they reach sinigalia nor should they be permit to leave until they come to the duke quarter where they should be seize the duke afterwards order all hi horseman and infantry of which there be more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footman to assemble by daybreak at the metauro a river five mile distant from fano and await him there he find himself therefore on the last day of december at the metauro with hi men and have send a cavalcade of about two hundred horseman before him he then move forward the infantry whom he accompany with the rest of the menat arm fano and sinigalia be two city of la marca situate on the shore of the adriatic sea fifteen mile distant from each other so that he who go towards sinigalia have the mountain on hi right hand the base of which be touch by the sea in some place the city of sinigalia be distant from the foot of the mountain a little more than a bowshot and from the shore about a mile on the side opposite to the city run a little river which bath that part of the wall look towards fano face the high road thus he who draw near to sinigalia come for a good space by road along the mountain and reach the river which pass by sinigalia if he turn to hi left hand along the bank of it and go for the distance of a bowshot he arrive at a bridge which cross the river he be then almost abreast of the gate that lead into sinigalia not by a straight line but transversely before this gate there stand a collection of house with a square to which the bank of the river form one side the vitellus and orsini have receive order to wait for the duke and to honour him in person send away their men to several castle distant from sinigalia about six mile so that room could be make for the men of the duke and they leave in sinigalia only oliverotto and hi band which consist of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horseman who be quarter in the suburb mention above matter have be thus arrange the duke valentino leave for sinigalia and when the leader of the cavalry reach the bridge they do not pas over but have open it one portion wheel towards the river and the other towards the country and a way be leave in the middle through which the infantry pass without stop into the town vitellozzo pagolo and the duke di gravina on mule accompany by a few horseman go towards the duke vitellozo unarm and wear a cape line with green appear very deject a if conscious of hi approach deatha circumstance which in view of the ability of the man and hi former fortune cause some amazement and it be say that when he part from hi men before set out for sinigalia to meet the duke he act a if it be hi last parting from them he recommend hi house and it fortune to hi captain and advise hi nephew that it be not the fortune of their house but the virtue of their father that should be keep in mind these three therefore come before the duke and salute him respectfully and be receive by him with goodwill they be at once place between those who be commission to look after them but the duke notice that oliverotto who have remain with hi band in sinigalia be missingfor oliverotto be wait in the square before hi quarter near the river keep hi men in order and drilling themsignalled with hi eye to don michelle to whom the care of oliverotto have be commit that he should take measure that oliverotto should not escape therefore don michele ride off and join oliverotto tell him that it be not right to keep hi men out of their quarter because these might be take up by the men of the duke and he advise him to send them at once to their quarter and to come himself to meet the duke and oliverotto have take this advice come before the duke who when he saw him call to him and oliverotto have make hi obeisance join the other so the whole party enter sinigalia dismount at the duke quarter and go with him into a secret chamber where the duke make them prisoner he then mount on horseback and issued order that the men of oliverotto and the orsini should be strip of their arm those of oliverotto be at hand be quickly settle but those of the orsini and vitellus be at a distance and have a presentiment of the destruction of their master have time to prepare themselves and bear in mind the valour and discipline of the orsinian and vitellian house they stand together against the hostile force of the country and save themselves but the duke soldier not be content with have pillage the men of oliverotto begin to sack sinigalia and if the duke have not repress this outrage by kill some of them they would have completely sack it night have come and the tumult be silence the duke prepare to kill vitellozzo and oliverotto he lead them into a room and cause them to be strangle neither of them use word in keep with their past life vitellozzo pray that he might ask of the pope full pardon for hi sin oliverotto cringe and lay the blame for all injury against the duke on vitellozzo pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini be keep alive until the duke heard from romethat the pope have take the cardinal orsino the archbishop of florence and messer jacopo da santa croce after which news on th january in the castle of pieve they also be strangle in the same way the life of castruccio castracani of lucca written by nicolo machiavelli and send to hi friend zanobi buondelmonti and luigi alamanni castruccio castracani it appear dear zanobi and luigi a wonderful thing to those who have consider the matter that all men or the large number of them who have perform great deed in the world and excel all other in their day have have their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity or have be aggrieve by fortune in some outrageous way they have either be expose to the mercy of wild beast or they have have so mean a parentage that in shame they have give themselves out to be son of jove or of some other deity it would be wearisome to relate who these person may have be because they be well know to everybody and a such tale would not be particularly edify to those who read them they be omit i believe that these lowly beginning of great men occur because fortune be desirous of show to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom because she begin to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career thus all success must be attribute to her castruccio castracani of lucca be one of those men who do great deed if he be measure by the time in which he live and the city in which he be bear but like many other he be neither fortunate nor distinguish in hi birth a the course of this history will show it appear to be desirable to recall hi memory because i have discern in him such indication of valour and fortune a should make him a great exemplar to men i think also that i ought to call your attention to hi action because you of all men i know delight most in noble deed the family of castracani be formerly number among the noble family of lucca but in the day of which i speak it have somewhat fall in estate a so often happen in this world to this family be bear a son antonio who become a priest of the order of san michele of lucca and for this reason be honour with the title of messer antonio he have an only sister who have be marry to buonaccorso cenami but buonaccorso die she become a widow and not wish to marry again go to live with her brother messer antonio have a vineyard behind the house where he reside and a it be bound on all side by garden any person could have access to it without difficulty one morning shortly after sunrise madonna dianora a the sister of messer antonio be call have occasion to go into the vineyard a usual to gather herb for season the dinner and hear a slight rustling among the leaf of a vine she turn her eye in that direction and heard something resemble the cry of an infant whereupon she go towards it and saw the hand and face of a baby who be lie envelop in the leaf and who seem to be cry for it mother partly wonder and partly fear yet full of compassion she lift it up and carry it to the house where she wash it and clothe it with clean linen a be customary and show it to messer antonio when he return home when he hear what have happen and saw the child he be not less surprised or compassionate than hi sister they discuss between themselves what should be do and see that he be priest and that she have no child they finally determine to bring it up they have a nurse for it and it be rear and love a if it be their own child they baptize it and give it the name of castruccio after their father a the year pass castruccio grow very handsome and give evidence of wit and discretion and learnt with a quickness beyond hi year those lesson which messer antonio impart to him messer antonio intend to make a priest of him and in time would have induct him into hi canonry and other benefice and all hi instruction be give with this object but antonio discover that the character of castruccio be quite unfitted for the priesthood as soon a castruccio reach the age of fourteen he begin to take less notice of the chiding of messer antonio and madonna dianora and no long to fear them he leave off read ecclesiastical book and turn to play with arm delight in nothing so much a in learn their us and in run leaping and wrestling with other boy in all exercise he far excel hi companion in courage and bodily strength and if at any time he do turn to book only those please him which tell of war and the mighty deed of men messer antonio behold all this with vexation and sorrow there live in the city of lucca a gentleman of the guinigi family name messer francesco whose profession be arm and who in rich bodily strength and valour excel all other men in lucca he have often fight under the command of the visconti of milan and a a ghibelline be the valued leader of that party in lucca this gentleman reside in lucca and be accustom to assemble with other most morning and evening under the balcony of the podesta which be at the top of the square of san michele the fine square in lucca and he have often see castruccio take part with other child of the street in those game of which i have speak noticing that castruccio far excel the other boy and that he appear to exercise a royal authority over them and that they love and obey him messer francesco become greatly desirous of learn who he be be inform of the circumstance of the bring up of castruccio he felt a great desire to have him near to him therefore he call him one day and ask him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman where he would learn to ride horse and use arm or in the house of a priest where he would learn nothing but mass and the service of the church messer francesco could see that it please castruccio greatly to hear horse and arm spoken of even though he stand silent blush modestly but be encourage by messer francesco to speak he answer that if hi master be agreeable nothing would please him more than to give up hi priestly study and take up those of a soldier this reply delight messer francesco and in a very short time he obtain the consent of messer antonio who be drive to yield by hi knowledge of the nature of the lad and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer thus castruccio pass from the house of messer antonio the priest to the house of messer francesco guinigi the soldier and it be astonish to find that in a very short time he manifest all that virtue and bearing which we be accustom to associate with a true gentleman in the first place he become an accomplished horseman and could manage with ease the most fiery charger and in all joust and tournament although still a youth he be observe beyond all other and he excel in all exercise of strength and dexterity but what enhance so much the charm of these accomplishment be the delightful modesty which enable him to avoid offence in either act or word to other for he be deferential to the great men modest with hi equal and courteous to hi inferior these gift make him beloved not only by all the guinigi family but by all lucca when castruccio have reach hi eighteenth year the ghibellines be drive from pavia by the guelphs and messer francesco be send by the visconti to assist the ghibellines and with him go castruccio in charge of hi force castruccio give ample proof of hi prudence and courage in this expedition acquire great reputation than any other captain and hi name and fame be know not only in pavia but throughout all lombardy castruccio have return to lucca in far high estimation that he leave it do not omit to use all the mean in hi power to gain a many friend a he could neglect none of those art which be necessary for that purpose about this time messer francesco die leave a son thirteen year of age name pagolo and have appoint castruccio to be hi son tutor and administrator of hi estate before he die francesco call castruccio to him and pray him to show pagolo that goodwill which he francesco have always show to him and to render to the son the gratitude which he have not be able to repay to the father upon the death of francesco castruccio become the governor and tutor of pagolo which increase enormously hi power and position and create a certain amount of envy against him in lucca in place of the former universal goodwill for many men suspect him of harbour tyrannical intention among these the lead man be giorgio degli opizi the head of the guelph party this man hop after the death of messer francesco to become the chief man in lucca but it seem to him that castruccio with the great ability which he already show and hold the position of governor deprive him of hi opportunity therefore he begin to sow those seed which should rob castruccio of hi eminence castruccio at first treat this with scorn but afterwards he grow alarmed thinking that messer giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of king ruberto of naples and have him drive out of lucca the lord of pisa at that time be uguccione of the faggiuola of arezzo who be in the first place elect their captain afterwards become their lord there reside in paris some exile ghibellines from lucca with whom castruccio hold communication with the object of effect their restoration by the help of uguccione castruccio also bring into hi plan friends from lucca who would not endure the authority of the opizi having fix upon a plan to be follow castruccio cautiously fortify the tower of the onesti fill it with supply and munition of war in order that it might stand a siege for a few day in case of need when the night come which have be agree upon with uguccione who have occupy the plain between the mountain and pisa with many men the signal be give and without be observe uguccione approach the gate of san piero and set fire to the portcullis castruccio raise a great uproar within the city call the people to arm and force open the gate from hi side uguccione enter with hi men pour through the town and kill messer giorgio with all hi family and many of hi friend and supporter the governor be drive out and the government reform accord to the wish of uguccione to the detriment of the city because it be find that more than one hundred family be exile at that time of those who flee part go to florence and part to pistoia which city be the headquarters of the guelph party and for this reason it become most hostile to uguccione and the lucchese a it now appear to the florentine and other of the guelph party that the ghibellines absorb too much power in tuscany they determine to restore the exiled guelphs to lucca they assemble a large army in the val di nievole and seize montecatini from thence they march to montecarlo in order to secure the free passage into lucca upon this uguccione assemble hi pisan and lucchese force and with a number of german cavalry which he draw out of lombardy he move against the quarter of the florentine who upon the appearance of the enemy withdraw from montecarlo and post themselves between montecatini and pescia uguccione now take up a position near to montecarlo and within about two mile of the enemy and slight skirmish between the horse of both party be of daily occurrence owe to the illness of uguccione the pisans and lucchese delayed come to battle with the enemy uguccione find himself grow worse go to montecarlo to be cure and leave the command of the army in the hand of castruccio this change bring about the ruin of the guelphs who think that the hostile army have lose it captain have lose it head grow overconfident castruccio observe this and allow some day to pass in order to encourage this belief he also show sign of fear and do not allow any of the munition of the camp to be use on the other side the guelphs grow more insolent the more they saw these evidence of fear and every day they draw out in the order of battle in front of the army of castruccio presently deem that the enemy be sufficiently embolden and have master their tactic he decide to join battle with them first he speak a few word of encouragement to hi soldier and point out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey hi command castruccio have notice how the enemy have place all hi best troop in the centre of the line of battle and hi less reliable men on the wing of the army whereupon he do exactly the opposite put hi most valiant men on the flank while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he move to the centre observe this order of battle he draw out of hi line and quickly come in sight of the hostile army who a usual have come in their insolence to defy him he then command hi centre squadron to march slowly whilst he move rapidly forward those on the wing thus when they come into contact with the enemy only the wing of the two army become engaged whilst the center battalion remain out of action for these two portion of the line of battle be separate from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other by this expedient the more valiant part of castruccios men be oppose to the weak part of the enemy troop and the most efficient men of the enemy be disengage and thus the florentine be unable to fight with those who be array opposite to them or to give any assistance to their own flank so without much difficulty castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flank and the centre battalion take to flight when they find themselves expose to attack without have a chance of display their valour the defeat be complete and the loss in men very heavy there be more than ten thousand men kill with many officer and knight of the guelph party in tuscany and also many prince who have come to help them among whom be piero the brother of king ruberto and carlo hi nephew and filippo the lord of taranto on the part of castruccio the loss do not amount to more than three hundred men among whom be francesco the son of uguccione who be young and rash be kill in the first onset this victory so greatly increase the reputation of castruccio that uguccione conceive some jealousy and suspicion of him because it appear to uguccione that this victory have give him no increase of power but rather than diminish it being of this mind he only wait for an opportunity to give effect to it this occur on the death of pier agnolo micheli a man of great repute and ability in lucca the murderer of whom flee to the house of castruccio for refuge on the sergeant of the captain go to arrest the murderer they be drive off by castruccio and the murderer escape this affair come to the knowledge of uguccione who be than at pisa it appear to him a proper opportunity to punish castruccio he therefore send for hi son neri who be the governor of lucca and commission him to take castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death castruccio fear no evil go to the governor in a friendly way be entertain at supper and then throw into prison but neri fear to put him to death lest the people should be incense kept him alive in order to hear far from hi father concern hi intention ugucionne curse the hesitation and cowardice of hi son and at once set out from pisa to lucca with four hundred horseman to finish the business in hi own way but he have not yet reach the bath when the pisans rebel and put hi deputy to death and create count gaddo della gherardesca their lord before uguccione reach lucca he hear of the occurrence at pisa but it do not appear wise to him to turn back l the lucchese with the example of pisa before them should close their gate against him but the lucchese have heard of what have happen at pisa avail themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of castruccio notwithstanding that uguccione have arrive in their city they first begin to speak of it in private circle afterwards openly in the square and street then they raise a tumult and with arm in their hand go to uguccione and demand that castruccio should be set at liberty uguccione fearing that bad might happen release him from prison whereupon castruccio gather hi friend around him and with the help of the people attack uguccione who find he have no resource but in flight rode away with hi friend to lombardy to the lord of scale where he die in poverty but castruccio from be a prisoner become almost a prince in lucca and he carry himself so discreetly with hi friend and the people that they appoint him captain of their army for one year have obtain this and wish to gain renown in war he plan the recovery of the many town which have rebel after the departure of uguccione and with the help of the pisans with whom he have conclude a treaty he march to serezzana to capture this place he construct a fort against it which be call today zerezzanello in the course of two month castruccio capture the town with the reputation gain at that siege he rapidly seize massa carrara and lavenza and in a short time have overrun the whole of lunigiana in order to close the pas which lead from lombardy to lunigiana he besiege pontremoli and wrest it from the hand of messer anastagio palavicini who be the lord of it after this victory he return to lucca and be welcome by the whole people and now castruccio deem it imprudent any long to defer make himself a prince get himself create the lord of lucca by the help of pazzino del poggio puccinello dal portico francesco boccansacchi and cecco guinigi all of whom he have corrupt and he be afterwards solemnly and deliberately elect prince by the people at this time frederick of bavaria the king of the roman come into italy to assume the imperial crown and castruccio in order that he might make friend with him meet him at the head of five hundred horseman castruccio have leave a hi deputy in lucca pagolo guinigi who be hold in high estimation because of the people love for the memory of hi father castruccio be receive in great honour by frederick and many privilege be confer upon him and he be appoint the emperor lieutenant in tuscany at this time the pisans be in great fear of gaddo della gherardesca whom they have drive out of pisa and they have recourse for assistance to frederick frederick create castruccio the lord of pisa and the pisans in dread of the guelph party and particularly of the florentine be constrain to accept him a their lord frederick have appoint a governor in rometo watch hi italian affair return to germany all the tuscan and lombardian ghibellines who follow the imperial lead have recourse to castruccio for help and counsel and all promise him the governorship of hi country if enable to recover it with hi assistance among these exile be matteo guidi nardo scolari lapo uberti gerozzo nardi and piero buonaccorsi all exile florentine and ghibellines castruccio have the secret intention of become the master of all tuscany by the aid of these men and of hi own force and in order to gain great weight in affair he enter into a league with messer matteo visconti the prince of milan and organize for him the force of hi city and the country district a lucca have five gate he divide hi own country district into five part which he supply with arm and enrol the men under captain and ensign so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldier without those whom he could summon to hi assistance from pisa while he surround himself with these force and ally it happen at messer matteo visconti be attack by the guelphs of piacenza who have drive out the ghibellines with the assistance of a florentine army and the king ruberto messer matteo call upon castruccio to invade the florentine in their own territory so that be attack at home they should be compel to draw their army out of lombardy in order to defend themselves castruccio invade the valdarno and seize fucecchio and san miniato inflict immense damage upon the country whereupon the florentine recall their army which have scarcely reach tuscany when castruccio be force by other necessity to return to lucca there reside in the city of lucca the poggio family who be so powerful that they could not only elevate castruccio but even advance him to the dignity of prince and it appear to them they have not receive such reward for their service a they deserve they incite other family to rebel and to drive castruccio out of lucca they find their opportunity one morning and arm themselves they set upon the lieutenant whom castruccio have leave to maintain order and kill him they endeavour to raise the people in revolt but stefano di poggio a peaceable old man who have take no hand in the rebellion intervene and compel them by hi authority to lay down their arm and he offer to be their mediator with castruccio to obtain from him what they desire therefore they lay down their arm with no great intelligence than they have take them up castruccio have hear the news of what have happen at lucca at once put pagolo guinigi in command of the army and with a troop of cavalry set out for home contrary to hi expectation he find the rebellion at an end yet he post hi men in the most advantageous place throughout the city a it appear to stefano that castruccio ought to be very much oblige to him he seek him out and without say anything on hi own behalf for he do not recognize any need for do so he beg castruccio to pardon the other member of hi family by reason of their youth their former friendship and the obligation which castruccio be under to their house to this castruccio graciously respond and beg stefano to reassure himself declare that it give him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it have ever cause him anxiety to hear of it inception he encourage stefano to bring hi family to him say that he thank god for have give him the opportunity of show hi clemency and liberality upon the word of stefano and castruccio they surrender and with stefano be immediately throw into prison and put to death meanwhile the florentine have recover san miniato whereupon it seem advisable to castruccio to make peace a it do not appear to him that he be sufficiently secure at lucca to leave him he approach the florentine with the proposal of a truce which they readily entertain for they be weary of the war and desirous of get rid of the expense of it a treaty be conclude with them for two year by which both party agree to keep the conquest they have make castruccio thus release from this trouble turn hi attention to affair in lucca and in order that he should not again be subject to the peril from which he have just escape he under various pretence and reason first wipe out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality not spar one of them but deprive them of country and property and those whom he have in hi hand of life also state that he have find by experience that none of them be to be trust then for hi further security he raise a fortress in lucca with the stone of the tower of those whom he have kill or hunt out of the state whilst castruccio make peace with the florentine and strengthen hi position in lucca he neglect no opportunity short of open war of increase hi importance elsewhere it appear to him that if he could get possession of pistoia he would have one foot in florence which be hi great desire he therefore in various way make friend with the mountaineer and work matter so in pistoia that both party confide their secret to him pistoia be divide a it always have be into the bianchi and neri party the head of the bianchi be bastiano di possente and of the neri jacopo da gia each of these men hold secret communication with castruccio and each desire to drive the other out of the city and after many threatenings they come to blow jacopo fortify himself at the florentine gate bastiano at that of the lucchese side of the city both trust more in castruccio than in the florentine because they believe that castruccio be far more ready and willing to fight than the florentine and they both send to him for assistance he give promise to both say to bastiano that he would come in person and to jacopo that he would send hi pupil pagolo guinigi at the appointed time he send forward pagolo by way of pisa and go himself direct to pistoia at midnight both of them meet outside the city and both be admit a friend thus the two leader enter and at a signal give by castruccio one kill jacopo da gia and the other bastiano di possente and both take prisoner or kill the partisan of either faction without further opposition pistoia pass into the hand of castruccio who have force the signoria to leave the palace compel the people to yield obedience to him make them many promise and remit their old debt the countryside flock to the city to see the new prince and all be fill with hope and quickly settle down influence in a great measure by hi great valour about this time great disturbance arise in romeowe to the dearness of living which be cause by the absence of the pontiff at avignon the german governor enrico be much blame for what happenedmurders and tumult follow each other daily without hi be able to put an end to them this cause enrico much anxiety l the roman should call in ruberto the king of naples who would drive the german out of the city and bring back the pope having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than castruccio he send to him beg him not only to give him assistance but also to come in person to romecastruccio consider that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service because he believe that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor cease to hold romeleaving pagolo guinigi in command at lucca castruccio set out for romewith six hundred horseman where he be receive by enrico with the great distinction in a short time the presence of castruccio obtain such respect for the emperor that without bloodshed or violence good order be restore chiefly by reason of castruccio have send by sea from the country round pisa large quantity of corn and thus remove the source of the trouble when he have chastise some of the roman leader and admonish other voluntary obedience be render to enrico castruccio receive many honour and be make a roman senator this dignity be assume with the great pomp castruccio be clothe in a brocaded toga which have the following word embroider on it front i be what god will whilst on the back be what god desire shall be during this time the florentine who be much enrage that castruccio should have seize pistoia during the truce consider how they could tempt the city to rebel to do which they think would not be difficult in hi absence among the exiled pistoians in florence be baldo cecchi and jacopo baldini both men of lead and ready to face danger these men keep up communication with their friend in pistoia and with the aid of the florentine enter the city by night and after drive out some of castruccios official and partisan and kill other they restore the city to it freedom the news of this greatly angered castruccio and take leave of enrico he press on in great haste to pistoia when the florentine heard of hi return knowing that he would lose no time they decide to intercept him with their force in the val di nievole under the belief that by do so they would cut off hi road to pistoia assemble a great army of the supporter of the guelph cause the florentine enter the pistoian territory on the other hand castruccio reach montecarlo with hi army and have hear where the florentine lay he decide not to encounter it in the plain of pistoia nor to await it in the plain of pescia but as far a he possibly could to attack it boldly in the pas of serravalle he believe that if he succeed in this design victory be assure although he be inform that the florentine have thirty thousand men whilst he have only twelve thousand although he have every confidence in hi own ability and the valour of hi troop yet he hesitate to attack hi enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelm by number serravalle be a castle between pescia and pistoia situate on a hill which block the val di nievole not in the exact pas but about a bowshot beyond the pas itself be in place narrow and steep whilst in general it ascend gently but be still narrow especially at the summit where the water divide so that twenty men side by side could hold it the lord of serravalle be manfred a german who before castruccio become lord of pistoia have be allow to remain in possession of the castle it be common to the lucchese and the pistoians and unclaimed by eitherneither of them wish to displace manfred as long a he keep hi promise of neutrality and come under obligation to no one for these reason and also because the castle be well fortify he have always be able to maintain hi position it be here that castruccio have determine to fall upon hi enemy for here hi few men would have the advantage and there be no fear lest see the large mass of the hostile force before they become engage they should not stand as soon a this trouble with florence arise castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him and have an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle he manage matter so with him that four hundred of hi men be to be admit into the castle the night before the attack on the florentine and the castellan put to death castruccio have prepare everything have now to encourage the florentine to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from pistoia into the val di nievole therefore he do not move hi army from montecarlo thus the florentine hurry on until they reach their encampment under serravalle intend to cross the hill on the following morning in the meantime castruccio have seize the castle at night have also move hi army from montecarlo and march from thence at midnight in dead silence have reach the foot of serravalle thus he and the florentine commence the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning castruccio send forward hi infantry by the main road and a troop of four hundred horseman by a path on the left towards the castle the florentine send forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which be follow never expect to find castruccio in possession of the hill nor be they aware of hi have seize the castle thus it happen that the florentine horseman mount the hill be completely take by surprise when they discover the infantry of castruccio and so close be they upon it they have scarcely time to pull down their visor it be a case of unready soldier be attack by ready and they be assail with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own although some few of them get through when the noise of the fighting reach the florentine camp below it be fill with confusion the cavalry and infantry become inextricably mixed the captain be unable to get their men either backward or forward owe to the narrowness of the pas and amid all this tumult no one know what ought to be do or what could be do in a short time the cavalry who be engage with the enemys infantry be scatter or kill without have make any effective defence because of their unfortunate position although in sheer desperation they have offer a stout resistance retreat have be impossible with the mountain on both flank whilst in front be their enemy and in the rear their friend when castruccio saw that hi men be unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight he send one thousand infantryman round by the castle with order to join the four hundred horseman he have previously dispatch there and command the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy these order they carry out with such fury that the florentine could not sustain the attack but give way and be soon in full retreatconquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy those in the rear turn towards pistoia and spread through the plain each man seek only hi own safety the defeat be complete and very sanguinary many captain be take prisoner among whom be bandini dei rossi francesco brunelleschi and giovanni della tosa all florentine nobleman with many tuscan and neapolitan who fight on the florentine side have be send by king ruberto to assist the guelphs immediately the pistoians heard of this defeat they drive out the friend of the guelphs and surrender to castruccio he be not content with occupy prato and all the castle on the plain on both side of the arno but march hi army into the plain of peretola about two mile from florence here he remain many day divide the spoil and celebrate hi victory with feast and game hold horse race and foot race for men and woman he also strike medal in commemoration of the defeat of the florentine he endeavour to corrupt some of the citizen of florence who be to open the city gate at night but the conspiracy be discover and the participators in it take and behead among whom be tommaso lupacci and lambertuccio frescobaldi this defeat cause the florentine great anxiety and despairing of preserve their liberty they send envoy to king ruberto of naples offer him the dominion of their city and he know of what immense importance the maintenance of the guelph cause be to him accept it he agree with the florentine to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florin and he send hi son carlo to florence with four thousand horseman shortly after this the florentine be relieve in some degree of the pressure of castruccios army owe to hi be compel to leave hi position before florence and march on pisa in order to suppress a conspiracy that have be raise against him by benedetto lanfranchi one of the first men in pisa who could not endure that hi fatherland should be under the dominion of the lucchese he have form this conspiracy intend to seize the citadel kill the partisan of castruccio and drive out the garrison a however in a conspiracy paucity of number be essential to secrecy so for it execution a few be not sufficient and in seek more adherent to hi conspiracy lanfranchi encounter a person who reveal the design to castruccio this betrayal can not be pass by without severe reproach to bonifacio cerchi and giovanni guidi two florentine exile who be suffer their banishment in pisa thereupon castruccio seize benedetto and put him to death and behead many other noble citizen and drive their family into exile it now appear to castruccio that both pisa and pistoia be thoroughly disaffect he employ much thought and energy upon secure hi position there and this give the florentine their opportunity to reorganize their army and to await the come of carlo the son of the king of naples when carlo arrive they decide to lose no more time and assemble a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalryhaving call to their aid every guelph there be in italy they consult whether they should attack pistoia or pisa first and decide that it would be good to march on the lattera course owe to the recent conspiracy more likely to succeed and of more advantage to them because they believe that the surrender of pistoia would follow the acquisition of pisa in the early part of may the florentine put in motion this army and quickly occupy lastra signa montelupo and empoli pass from thence on to san miniato when castruccio heard of the enormous army which the florentine be send against him he be in no degree alarm believing that the time have now arrive when fortune would deliver the empire of tuscany into hi hand for he have no reason to think that hi enemy would make a good fight or have good prospect of success than at pisa or serravalle he assemble twenty thousand foot soldier and four thousand horseman and with this army go to fucecchio whilst he send pagolo guinigi to pisa with five thousand infantry fucecchio have a strong position than any other town in the pisan district owe to it situation between the river arno and gusciana and it slight elevation above the surround plain moreover the enemy could not hinder it be victual unless they divide their force nor could they approach it either from the direction of lucca or pisa nor could they get through to pisa or attack castruccios force except at a disadvantage in one case they would find themselves place between hi two armies the one under hi own command and the other under pagolo and in the other case they would have to cross the arno to get to close quarter with the enemy an undertaking of great hazard in order to tempt the florentine to take this latter course castruccio withdraw hi men from the bank of the river and place them under the wall of fucecchio leave a wide expanse of land between them and the river the florentine have occupy san miniato hold a council of war to decide whether they should attack pisa or the army of castruccio and have weigh the difficulty of both course they decide upon the latter the river arno be at that time low enough to be fordable yet the water reach to the shoulder of the infantryman and to the saddle of the horseman on the morning of june the florentine commence the battle by order forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry castruccio whose plan of action be fix and who well know what to do at once attack the florentine with five thousand infantry and three thousand horseman not allow them to issue from the river before he charge them he also send one thousand light infantry up the river bank and the same number down the arno the infantry of the florentine be so much impede by their arm and the water that they be not able to mount the bank of the river whilst the cavalry have make the passage of the river more difficult for the other by reason of the few who have cross have break up the bed of the river and this be deep with mud many of the horse roll over with their rider and many of them have stick so fast that they could not move when the florentine captain saw the difficulty their men be meet they withdraw them and move high up the river hop to find the river bed less treacherous and the bank more adapted for land these men be meet at the bank by the force which castruccio have already send forward who be light arm with buckler and javelin in their hand let fly with tremendous shout into the face and body of the cavalry the horse alarm by the noise and the wound would not move forward and trample each other in great confusion the fight between the men of castruccio and those of the enemy who succeed in crossing be sharp and terrible both side fight with the utmost desperation and neither would yield the soldier of castruccio fought to drive the other back into the river whilst the florentine strive to get a footing on land in order to make room for the other press forward who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight and in this obstinate conflict they be urge on by their captain castruccio shout to hi men that these be the same enemy whom they have before conquer at serravalle whilst the florentine reproach each other that the many should be overcome by the few at length castruccio see how long the battle have last and that both hi men and the enemy be utterly exhaust and that both side have many kill and wound push forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who be fight he then command these latter to open their rank a if they intend to retreat and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left this clear a space of which the florentine at once take advantage and thus gain possession of a portion of the battlefield but when these tire soldier find themselves at close quarter with castruccios reserve they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river the cavalry of either side have not a yet gain any decisive advantage over the other because castruccio know hi inferiority in this arm have command hi leader only to stand on the defensive against the attack of their adversary a he hop that when he have overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry this fell out a he have hop for when he saw the florentine army drive back across the river he order the remainder of hi infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy this they do with lance and javelin and join by their own cavalry fell upon the enemy with the great fury and soon put him to flight the florentine captain have see the difficulty their cavalry have meet with in cross the river have attempt to make their infantry cross lower down the river in order to attack the flank of castruccios army but here also the bank be steep and already line by the men of castruccio and this movement be quite useless thus the florentine be so completely defeat at all point that scarcely a third of them escape and castruccio be again cover with glory many captain be take prisoner and carlo the son of king ruberto with michelagnolo falconi and taddeo degli albizzi the florentine commissioner flee to empoli if the spoil be great the slaughter be infinitely great a might be expect in such a battle of the florentine there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirtyone men whilst castruccio lose one thousand five hundred and seventy men but fortune grow envious of the glory of castruccio take away hi life just at the time when she should have preserve it and thus ruin all those plan which for so long a time he have work to carry into effect and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stop him castruccio be in the thick of the battle the whole of the day and when the end of it come although fatigue and overheat he stand at the gate of fucecchio to welcome hi men on their return from victory and personally thank them he be also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortune of the day he be of the opinion that it be the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it here castruccio stand expose to a wind which often rise at midday on the bank of the arno and which be often very unhealthy from this he take a chill of which he think nothing a he be accustom to such trouble but it be the cause of hi death on the following night he be attack with high fever which increase so rapidly that the doctor saw it must prove fatal castruccio therefore call pagolo guinigi to him and address him a follow if i could have believe that fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which be lead to that glory which all my success promise i should have labour less and i should have leave thee if a small state at least with few enemy and peril because i should have be content with the governorship of lucca and pisa i should neither have subjugate the pistoians nor outrage the florentine with so many injury but i would have make both these people my friend and i should have live if no long at least more peacefully and have leave you a state without a doubt small but one more secure and establish on a surer foundation but fortune who insist upon have the arbitrament of human affair do not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first nor the time to surmount it thou hast heard for many have tell thee and i have never conceal it how i enter the house of thy father whilst yet a boya stranger to all those ambition which every generous soul should feeland how i be bring up by him and love a though i have be bear of hi blood how under hi governance i learn to be valiant and capable of avail myself of all that fortune of which thou hast be witness when thy good father come to die he committed thee and all hi possession to my care and i have bring thee up with that love and increase thy estate with that care which i be bind to show and in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father leave but also that which my fortune and ability have gain i have never marry so that the love of child should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which i owe to the child of thy father thus i leave thee a vast estate of which i be well content but i be deeply concerned inasmuch a i leave it thee unsettled and insecure thou hast the city of lucca on thy hand which will never rest content under they government thou hast also pisa where the men be of nature changeable and unreliable who although they may be sometimes hold in subjection yet they will ever disdain to serve under a lucchese pistoia be also disloyal to thee she be eat up with faction and deeply incense against thy family by reason of the wrong recently inflict upon them thou hast for neighbour the offended florentine injure by u in a thousand way but not utterly destroy who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all tuscany in the emperor and in the prince of milan thou canst place no reliance for they be far distant slow and their help be very long in come therefore thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own ability and in the memory of my valour and in the prestige which this late victory have bring thee which a thou knowest how to use it with prudence will assist thee to come to term with the florentine who a they be suffer under this great defeat should be incline to listen to thee and whereas i have seek to make them my enemy because i believe that war with them would conduce to my power and glory thou hast every inducement to make friend of them because their alliance will bring thee advantage and security it be of the great important in this world that a man should know himself and the measure of hi own strength and mean and he who know that he have not a genius for fight must learn how to govern by the art of peace and it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel and to learn in this way to enjoy what my lifework and danger have gain and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what i have tell thee be true and thou wilt be doubly indebted to me in that i have leave thee this realm and have teach thee how to keep it after this there come to castruccio those citizen of pisa pistoia and lucca who have be fight at hi side and whilst recommend pagolo to them and make them swear obedience to him a hi successor he die he leave a happy memory to those who have know him and no prince of those time be ever love with such devotion a he be hi obsequies be celebrate with every sign of mourning and he be bury in san francesco at lucca fortune be not so friendly to pagolo guinigi a she have be to castruccio for he have not the ability not long after the death of castruccio pagolo lose pisa and then pistoia and only with difficulty hold on to lucca this latter city continue in the family of guinigi until the time of the greatgrandson of pagolo from what have be relate here it will be see that castruccio be a man of exceptional ability not only measure by men of hi own time but also by those of an early date in stature he be above the ordinary height and perfectly proportion he be of a gracious presence and he welcome men with such urbanity that those who speak with him rarely leave him displease hi hair be incline to be red and he wear it cut short above the ear and whether it rain or snow he always go without a hat he be delightful among friend but terrible to hi enemy just to hi subject ready to play false with the unfaithful and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desire to subdue because he be wont to say that it be the victory that bring the glory not the method of achieve it no one be bolder in face danger none more prudent in extricate himself he be accustom to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing that god be a lover of strong men because one always see that the weak be chastise by the strong he be also wonderfully sharp or bite though courteous in hi answer and a he do not look for any indulgence in this way of speak from other so he be not anger with other do not show it to him it have often happen that he have listen quietly when other have speak sharply to him a on the following occasion he have cause a ducat to be give for a partridge and be take to task for do so by a friend to whom castruccio have say you would not have give more than a penny that be true answer the friend then say castruccio to
