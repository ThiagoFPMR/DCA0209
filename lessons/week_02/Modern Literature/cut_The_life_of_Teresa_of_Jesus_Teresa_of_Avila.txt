distinctly and in detail of my grievous sin and wicked lifebut it have notbe so will on the contrary i be laid herein under great restraint and therefore for the love of our lord i beg of every one who shall read this story of my life to keep in mind how wicked it have be and how among the saint who be convert to god i have never find one in whom i can have any comfortfor i see that they after our lord have call them never fell into sin again i notonly become bad but a it seem to me deliberately withstand the grace of hi majesty because i saw that i be thereby bind to serve him more earnestly know at the same time that of myself i could notpay the least portion of my debt may he be bless for ever who wait for me so long i implore him with my whole heart to send me hi grace so that in all clearness and truth i may give this account of myself which my confessor command me to give and even our lord himself i know it have also will it should be give for some time past but i have notthe courage to attempt itand i pray it may be to hi praise and glory and a help to my confessor who know me good may succour my weakness so that i may render to our lord some portion of the service i owe himmay all creature praise him for ever amen childhood and early impressionsthe blessing of pious parentsdesire of martyrdomdeath of the saint mother i have a father and mother who be devout and fear godour lord also help me with hi graceall this would have be enough to make me good if i have notbe so wickedmy father be very much give to the reading of good book and so he have them in spanish that hi child might read themthese book with my mother carefulness to make u say our prayer and to bring u up devout to our lady and to certain saint begin to make me think seriously when i be i believe six or seven year oldit help me too that i never saw my father and mother respect anything but goodnessthey be very good themselvesmy father be a man of great charity towards the poor and compassion for the sick and also for servant so much so that he never could be persuade to keep slave for he pity them so much and a slave belonging to one of hi brother be once in hi house be treat by him with as much tenderness a hi own childrenhe use to say that he could notendure the pain of see that she be notfreehe be a man of great truthfulness nobody ever hear him swear or speak ill of any one hi life be most pure my mother also be a woman of great goodness and her life be spend in great infirmitiesshe be singularly pure in all her waysthough possessing great beauty yet be it never know that she give reason to suspect that she make any account whatever of it for though she be only threeandthirty year of age when she die her apparel be already that of a woman advance in yearsshe be very calm and have great sensethe suffering she go through during her life be grievous her death most christian we be three sister and nine brother all by the mercy of god resemble their parent in goodness except myself though i be the most cherished of my fatherand before i begin to offend god i think he have some reasonfor i be fill with sorrow whenever i think of the good desire with which our lord inspire me and what a wretched use i make of thembesides my brother never in any way hinder me in the service of god one of my brother be nearly of my own age and he it be whom i most love though i be very fond of them all and they of mehe and i use to read life of saint togetherwhen i read of martyrdom undergone by the saint for the love of god it strike me that the vision of god be very cheaply purchase and i have a great desire to die a martyr deathnot out of any love of him of which i be conscious but that i might most quickly attain to the fruition of those great joy of which i read that they be reserve in heaven and i use to discuss with my brother how we could become martyrswe settled to go together to the country of the moor beg our way for the love of god that we might be there behead and our lord i believe have give u courage enough even at so tender an age if we could have find the mean to proceed but our great difficulty seem to be our father and mother it astonish u greatly to find it say in what we be read that pain and bliss be everlastingwe happen very often to talk about this and we have a pleasure in repeat frequently for ever ever ever through the constant uttering of these word our lord be pleased that i should receive an abide impression of the way of truth when i be yet a child as soon a i saw it be impossible to go to any place where people would put me to death for the sake of god my brother and i set about become hermit and in an orchard belonging to the house we contrive as well a we could to build hermitage by pile up small stone one on the other which fell down immediately and so it come to pass that we find no mean of accomplish our wisheven now i have a feeling of devotion when i consider how god give me in my early youth what i lose by my own faulti give alms a i couldand i could but littlei contrive to be alone for the sake of say my prayer and they be manyespecially the rosary to which my mother have a great devotion and have make u also in this like herselfi use to delight exceedingly when play with other child in the building of monastery a if we be nun and i think i wish to be a nun though notso much a i do to be a martyr or a hermit i remember that when my mother die i be about twelve year olda little lesswhen i begin to understand my loss i go in my affliction to an image of our lady and with many tear implore her to be my motheri do this in my simplicity and i believe that it be of service to me for i have by experience find the royal virgin help me whenever i recommend myself to her and at last she have bring me back to herselfit distress me now when i think of and reflect on that which keep me from be earnest in the good desire with which i begin o my lord since thou art determine to save memay it be the pleasure of thy majesty to effect itand to bestow upon me so many grace why have it notbe thy pleasure alsonot for my advantage but for thy great honourthat this habitation wherein thou hast continually to dwell should nothave contract so much defilement it distress me even to say this o my lord because i know the fault be all my own seeing that thou hast leave nothing undone to make me even from my youth wholly thinewhen i would complain of my parent i can notdo it for i saw nothing in them but all good and carefulness for my welfarethen grow up i begin to discover the natural gift which our lord have give methey be say to be many and when i should have give him thanks for them i make use of every one of them a i shall now explain to offend him early impressionsdangerous book and companionsthe saint is placed in a monastery what i shall now speak of be i believe the beginning of great harm to mei often think how wrong it be of parent notto be very careful that their child should always and in every way see only that which be good for though my mother be a i have just say so good herself nevertheless i when i come to the use of reason do notderive so much good from her a i ought to have donealmost none at all and the evil i learn do me much harmshe be very fond of book of chivalry but this pastime do nothurt her so much a it hurt me because she never waste her time on them only we her child be leave at liberty to read them and perhaps she do this to distract her thought from her great suffering and occupy her child that they might notgo astray in other waysit annoy my father so much that we have to be careful he never saw usi contract a habit of read these book and this little fault which i observe in my mother be the beginning of lukewarmness in my good desire and the occasion of my fall away in other respectsi think there be no harm in it when i waste many hour night and day in so vain an occupation even when i keep it a secret from my fatherso completely be i master by this passion that i think i could never be happy without a new book i begin to make much of dress to wish to please other by my appearancei take pain with my hand and my hair use perfume and all vanity within my reachand they be many for i be very much give to themi have no evil intention because i never wish any one to offend god for methis fastidiousness of excessive neatness last some year and so also do other practice which i think then be notat all sinful now i see how wrong all this must have be i have some cousin for into my father house no other be allow an entrancein this he be very cautious and would to god he have be cautious about themfor i see now the danger of converse at an age when virtue should begin to grow with person who know nothing themselves of the vanity of the world provoke other to throw themselves into the midst of itthese cousin be nearly of mine own agea little old perhapswe be always together and they have a great affection for mein everything that give them pleasure i keep the conversation alivelistened to the story of their affection and childish folly good for nothing and what be still bad my soul begin to give itself up to that which be the cause of all it disordersif i be to give advice i would say to parent that they ought to be very careful whom they allow to mix with their child when young for much mischief thence ensues and our natural inclination be unto evil rather than unto good so it be with me for i have a sister much old than myself from whose modesty and goodness which be great i learn nothing and learn every evil from a relative who be often in the houseshe be so light and frivolous that my mother take great pain to keep her out of the house a if she foresee the evil i should learn from her but she could notsucceed there be so many reason for her comingi be very fond of this person company gossip and talk with her for she help me in all the amusement i like and what be more found some for me and communicate to me her own conversation and her vanitiesuntil i know her i mean until she become friendly with me and communicate to me her own affairsi be then about fourteen year old a little more i thinki do notbelieve that i turn away from god in mortal sin or lose the fear of him though i have a great fear of disgracethis latter fear have such sway over me that i never wholly forfeit my good nameand a to that there be nothing in the world for which i would have barter it and nobody in the world i like well enough who could have persuade me to do itthus i might have have the strength never to do anything against the honour of god a i have it by nature notto fail in that wherein i think the honour of the world consist and i never observe that i be fail in many other waysin vainly seek after it i be extremely careful but in the use of the mean necessary for preserve it i be utterly carelessi be anxious only notto be lose altogether this friendship distress my father and sister exceedinglythey often blame me for it but a they could nothinder that person from come into the house all their effort be in vain for i be very adroit in do anything that be wrongnow and then i be amaze at the evil one bad companion can donor could i believe it if i do notknow it by experienceespecially when we be young then be it that the evil must be greatestoh that parent would take warning by me and look carefully to this so it be the conversation of this person so change me that no trace be leave of my souls natural disposition to virtue and i become a reflection of her and of another who be give to the same kind of amusement i know from this the great advantage of good companion and i be certain that if at that tender age i have be throw among good people i should have persevere in virtue for if at that time i have find any one to teach me the fear of god my soul would have grow strong enough notto fall awayafterwards when the fear of god have utterly depart from me the fear of dishonour alone remain and be a torment to me in all i didwhen i think that nobody would ever know i venture upon many thing that be neither honourable nor please unto god in the beginning these conversation do me harmi believe sothe fault be perhaps nothers but mine for afterwards my own wickedness be enough to lead me astray together with the servant about me whom i find ready enough for all evilif any one of these have give me good advice i might perhaps have profit by it but they be blind by interest a i be by passionstill i be never incline to much evilfor i hat naturally anything dishonourablebut only to the amusement of a pleasant conversationthe occasion of sin however be present danger be at hand and i expose to it my father and brothersgod deliver me out of it all so that i should notbe lose in a manner visibly against my will yet notso secretly a to allow me to escape without the loss of my good name and the suspicion of my father i have notspend i think three month in these vanity when they take me to a monastery in the city where i live in which child like myself be bring up though their way of life be notso wicked a minethis be do with the utmost concealment of the true reason which be know only to myself and one of my kindredthey wait for an opportunity which would make the change seem nothing out of the way for a my sister be marry it be notfit i should remain alone without a mother in the house so excessive be my father love for me and so deep my dissembling that he never would believe me to be so wicked a i be and hence i be never in disgrace with himthough some remark be make yet a the time have be short nothing could be positively asserted and a i be so much afraid about my good name i have take every care to be secret and yet i never consider that i could conceal nothing from him who seeth all thingso my god what evil be do in the world by disregard this and think that anything can be keep secret that be do against thee i be quite certain that great evil would be avoid if we clearly understand that what we have to do be notto be on our guard against men but on our guard against displease thee for the first eight day i suffer much but more from the suspicion that my vanity be know than from be in the monastery for i be already weary of myselfand though i offend god i never cease to have a great fear of him and contrive to go to confession as quickly a i couldi be very uncomfortable but within eight day i think sooner i be much more contented than i have be in my father houseall the nun be pleased with me for our lord have give me the grace to please every one wherever i might bei be therefore make much of in the monasterythough at this time i hat to be a nun yet i be delight at the sight of nun so good for they be very good in that housevery prudent observant of the rule and recollect yet for all this the devil do notcease to tempt me and people in the world seek mean to trouble my rest with message and presentsas this could notbe allow it be soon over and my soul begin to return to the good habit of my early year and i recognize the great mercy of god to those whom he place among good peopleit seem a if hi majesty have seek and seek again how to convert me to himselfblessed be thou o lord for have borne with me so long amen be it notfor my many fault there be some excuse for me i think in this that the conversation i share in be with one who i think would do well in the estate of matrimony and i be tell by my confessor and other also whom in many point i consult use to say that i be notoffend godone of the nun sleep with u who be secular and through her it please our lord to give me light a i shall now explain the blessing of being with good peoplehow certain illusion were removed i begin gradually to like the good and holy conversation of this nunhow well she use to speak of god for she be a person of great discretion and sanctityi listen to her with delighti think there never be a time when i be notglad to listen to hershe begin by tell me how she come to be a nun through the mere reading of the word of the gospel many be call and few be choose she would speak of the reward which our lord give to those who forsake all thing for hi sakethis good companionship begin to root out the habit which bad companionship have form and to bring my thought back to the desire of eternal thing as well a to banish in some measure the great dislike i have to be a nun which have be very great and if i saw any one weep in prayer or devout in any other way i envy her very much for my heart be now so hard that i could notshed a tear even if i read the passion throughthis be a grief to me i remain in the monastery a year and a half and be very much the good for iti begin to say many vocal prayer and to ask all the nun to pray for me that god would place me in that state wherein i be to serve him but for all this i wish notto be a nun and that god would notbe pleased i should be one though at the same time i be afraid of marriageat the end of my stay there i have a great inclination to be a nun yet notin that house on account of certain devotional practice which i understand prevail there and which i think overstrainedsome of the young one encourage me in this my wish and if all have be of one mind i might have profit by iti have also a great friend in another monastery and this make me resolve if i be to be a nun notto be one in any other house than where she wasi look more to the pleasure of sense and vanity than to the good of my soulthese good thought of be a nun come to me from time to timethey left me very soon and i could notpersuade myself to become one at this time though i be notcareless about my own good our lord be much more careful to dispose me for that state of life which be best for mehe send me a serious illness so that i be oblige to return to my father house when i become well again they take me to see my sister in her house in the country village where she dwelther love for me be so great that if she have have her will i should never have leave herher husband also have a great affection for meat least he show me all kindnessthis too i owe rather to our lord for i have receive kindness everywhere and all my service in return be that i be what i be on the road live a brother of my father a prudent and most excellent man then a widowerhim too our lord be prepare for himselfin hi old age he leave all hi possession and become a religioushe so finish hi course that i believe him to have the vision of godhe would have me stay with him some dayshis practice be to read good book in spanish and hi ordinary conversation be about god and the vanity of the worldthese book he make me read to him and though i do notmuch like them i appear a if i do for in give pleasure to other i have be most particular though it might be painful to myselfso much so that what in other might have be a virtue be in me a great fault because i be often extremely indiscreeto my god in how many way do hi majesty prepare me for the state wherein it be hi will i should serve himhow against my own will he constrain me to do violence to myself may he be bless for ever amen though i remain here but a few day yet through the impression make on my heart by the word of god both heard and read and by the good conversation of my uncle i come to understand the truth i have hear in my childhood that all thing be a nothing the world vanity and pass rapidly awayi also begin to be afraid that if i be then to die i should go down to hellthough i could notbend my will to be a nun i saw that the religious state be the best and the safestand thus by little and little i resolve to force myself into it the struggle last three monthsi use to press this reason against myself the trial and suffering of living a a nun can notbe great than those of purgatory and i have well deserve to be in hellit be notmuch to spend the rest of my life a if i be in purgatory and then go straight to heavenwhich be what i desiredi be more influenced by servile fear i think than by love to enter religion the devil put before me that i could notendure the trial of the religious life because of my delicate nurturei defend myself against him by allege the trial which christ endure and that it be notmuch for me to suffer something for hi sake besides he would help me to bear iti must have think so but i do notremember this considerationi endure many temptation during these daysi be subject to faintingfits attend with feverfor my health be always weaki have become by this time fond of good book and that give me lifei read the epistle of stjerome which fill me with so much courage that i resolve to tell my father of my purposewhich be almost like take the habit for i be so jealous of my word that i would never for any consideration recede from a promise when once my word have be give my father love for me be so great that i could never obtain hi consent nor could the prayer of other whom i persuade to speak to him be of any availthe utmost i could get from him be that i might do a i please after hi deathi now begin to be afraid of myself and of my own weaknessfor i might go backso consider that such waiting be notsafe for me i obtain my end in another way a i shall now relate our lord help her to become a nunher many infirmity in those day when i be thus resolve i have persuade one of my brother by speak to him of the vanity of the world to become a friar and we agree together to set out one day very early in the morning for the monastery where that friend of mine live for whom i have so great an affection though i would have go to any other monastery if i think i should serve god well in it or to any one my father like so strong be my resolution now to become a nunfor i think more of the salvation of my soul now and make no account whatever of mine own easei remember perfectly well and it be quite true that the pain i felt when i leave my father house be so great that i do notbelieve the pain of dying will be greaterfor it seem to me a if every bone in my body be wrench asunder for a i have no love of god to destroy my love of father and of kindred this latter love come upon me with a violence so great that if our lord have notbe my keeper my own resolution to go on would have fail mebut he give me courage to fight against myself so that i execute my purpose when i take the habit our lord at once make me understand how he help those who do violence to themselves in order to serve himno one observe this violence in me they saw nothing but the great good willat that moment because i be enter on that state i be fill with a joy so great that it have never fail me to this day and god convert the aridity of my soul into the great tendernesseverything in religion be a delight unto me and it be true that now and then i use to sweep the house during those hour of the day which i have formerly spend on my amusement and my dress and call to mind that i be deliver from such folly i be fill with a new joy that surprise me nor could i understand whence it come whenever i remember this there be nothing in the world however hard it may be that if it be propose to me i would notundertake without any hesitation whatever for i know now by experience in many thing that if from the first i resolutely persevere in my purpose even in this life hi majesty reward it in a way which he only understand who have try itwhen the act be do for god only it be hi will before we begin it that the soul in order to the increase of it merit should be afraid and the great the fear if we do but succeed the great the reward and the sweetness thence afterwards resultingi know this by experience a i have just say in many serious affair and so if i be a person who have to advise anybody i would never counsel any one to whom good inspiration from time to time may come to resist them through fear of the difficulty of carry them into effect for if a person live detach for the love of god only that be no reason for be afraid of failure for he be omnipotentmay he be bless for ever amen o supreme good and my rest those grace ought to have be enough which thou hadst give me hitherto see that thy compassion and greatness have draw me through so many winding to a state so secure to a house where there be so many servant of god from whom i might learn how i may advance in thy servicei know nothow to go on when i call to mind the circumstance of my profession the great resolution and joy with which i make it and my betrothal unto theei can notspeak of it without tear and my tear ought to be tear of blood my heart ought to break and that would notbe much to suffer because of the many offence against thee which i have commit since that dayit seem to me now that i have good reason for notwish for this dignity see that i have make so sad a use of itbut thou o my lord hast be willing to bear with me for almost twenty year of my evil use of thy grace till i might become betterit seem to me o my god that i do nothing but promise never to keep any of the promise then make to theeyet such be notmy intention but i see that what i have do since be of such a nature that i know notwhat my intention wasso it be and so it happen that it may be the good know o my bridegroom who thou art and what i be it be certainly true that very frequently the joy i have in that the multitude of thy mercy be make know in me soften the bitter sense of my great faultsin whom o lord can they shine forth a they do in me who by my evil deed have shroud in darkness thy great grace which thou hadst begin to work in me woe be me o my maker if i would make an excuse i have none to offer and i only be to blamefor if i could return to thee any portion of that love which thou hadst begin to show unto me i would give it only unto thee and then everything would have be safebut a i have notdeserve this nor be so happy a to have do it let thy mercy o lord rest upon me the change in the habit of my life and in my food prove hurtful to my health and though my happiness be great that be notenoughthe faintingfits begin to be more frequent and my heart be so seriously affect that every one who saw it be alarm and i have also many other ailmentsand thus it be i spend the first year have very bad health though i do notthink i offend god in it muchand a my illness be so seriousi be almost insensible at all time and frequently wholly somy father take great pain to find some relief and a the physician who attend me have none to give he have me take to a place which have a great reputation for the cure of other infirmitiesthey say i should find relief there that friend of whom i have speak a be in the house go with mesh be one of the elder nunsin the house where i be a nun there be no vow of enclosure i remain there nearly a year for three month of it suffer most cruel tortureseffects of the violent remedy which they appliedi know nothow i endure them and indeed though i submit myself to them they be a i shall relate more than my constitution could bear i be to begin the treatment in the spring and go thither when winter commencedthe intervening time i spend with my sister of whom i speak before in her house in the country wait for the month of april which be draw near that i might nothave to go and returnthe uncle of whom i have make mention before and whose house be on our road give me a book call tercer abecedario which treat of the prayer of recollectionthough in the first year i have read good booksfor i would read no other because i understand now the harm they have do mei do notknow how to make my prayer nor how to recollect myselfi be therefore much please with the book and resolve to follow the way of prayer it describe with all my mightand a our lord have already bestow upon me the gift of tear and i find pleasure in read i begin to spend a certain time in solitude to go frequently to confession and make a beginning of that way of prayer with this book for my guide for i have no masteri mean no confessorwho understand me though i seek for such a one for twenty year afterwards which do me much harm in that i frequently go backwards and might have be even utterly lose for anyhow a director would have help me to escape the risk i run of sin against god from the very beginning god be most gracious unto methough i be notso free from sin a the book require i pass that by such watchfulness seem to me almost impossiblei be on my guard against mortal sinand would to god i have always be sobut i be careless about venial sin and that be my ruinyet for all this at the end of my stay therei spend nearly nine month in the practice of solitudeour lord begin to comfort me so much in this way of prayer a in hi mercy to raise me to the prayer of quiet and now and then to that of union though i understand notwhat either the one or the other be nor the great esteem i ought to have have of themi believe it would have be a great blessing to me if i have understand the matterit be true that the prayer of union last but a short time i know notif it continue for the space of an ave maria but the fruit of it remain and they be such that though i be then nottwenty year of age i seem to despise the world utterly and so i remember how sorry i be for those who follow it way though only in thing lawful i use to labour with all my might to imagine jesus christ our good and our lord present within meand this be the way i prayedif i meditate on any mystery of hi life i represent it to myself a within me though the great part of my time i spend in read good book which be all my comfort for god never endow me with the gift of make reflection with the understanding or with that of use the imagination to any good purpose my imagination be so sluggish that even if i would think of or picture to myself a i use to labour to picture our lord humanity i never could do it and though men may attain more quickly to the state of contemplation if they persevere by this way of inability to exert the intellect yet be the process more laborious and painful for if the will have nothing to occupy it and if love have no present object to rest on the soul be without support and without employmentits isolation and dryness occasion great pain and the thought assail it most grievouslypersons in this condition must have great purity of conscience than those who can make use of their understanding for he who can use hi intellect in the way of meditation on what the world be on what he owe to god on the great suffering of god for him hi own scanty service in return and on the reward god reserve for those who love him learn how to defend himself against hi own thought and against the occasion and peril of sinon the other hand he who have notthat power be in great danger and ought to occupy himself much in read see that he be notin the slight degree able to help himself this way of proceeding be so exceedingly painful that if the master who teach it insist on cut off the succour which read give and require the spending of much time in prayer then i say it will be impossible to persevere long in it and if he persist in hi plan health will be ruin because it be a most painful processreading be of great service towards procure recollection in any one who proceed in this way and it be even necessary for him however little it may be that he read if only a a substitute for the mental prayer which be beyond hi reach now i seem to understand that it be the good providence of our lord over me that find no one to teach meif i have it would have be impossible for me to persevere during the eighteen year of my trial and of those great aridity because of my inability to meditateduring all this time it be only after communion that i ever venture to begin my prayer without a bookmy soul be as much afraid to pray without one a if it have to fight against a hostwith a book to help meit be like a companion and a shield whereon to receive the blow of many thoughtsi find comfort for it be notusual with me to be in aridity but i always be so when i have no book for my soul be disturb and my thought wander at oncewith one i begin to collect my thought and use it a a decoy keep my soul in peace very frequently by merely open a bookthere be no necessity for moresometimes i read but little at other time muchaccording a our lord have pity on me it seem to me in these beginning of which i be speak that there could be no danger capable of withdraw me from so great a blessing if i have but book and could have remain alone and i believe that by the grace of god it would have be so if i have have a master or any one to warn me against those occasion of sin in the beginning and if i fell to bring me quickly out of themif the devil have assail me openly then i believe i should never have fall into any grievous sin but he be so subtle and i so weak that all my good resolution be of little servicethough in those day in which i serve god they be very profitable in enable me with that patience which hi majesty give me to endure the alarming illnesses which i have to beari have often think with wonder of the great goodness of god and my soul have rejoice in the contemplation of hi great magnificence and mercymay he be bless for everfor i see clearly that he have notomit to reward me even in this life for every one of my good desiresmy good work however wretched and imperfect have be make well and perfect by him who be my lord he have render them meritoriousas to my evil deed and my sin he hide them at oncethe eye of those who saw them he make even blind and he have blot them out of their memoryhe gild my fault make virtue to shine forth give it to me himself and compel me to possess it a it be by force i must now return to that which have be enjoin mei say that if i have to describe minutely how our lord dealt with me in the beginning it would be necessary for me to have another understanding than that i have so that i might be able to appreciate what i owe to him together with my own ingratitude and wickedness for i have forget it all may he be bless for ever who have bear with me so long amen illness and patience of the saintthe story of a priest whom she rescue from a life of sin i forget to say how in the year of my novitiate i suffer much uneasiness about thing in themselves of no importance but i be find fault with very often when i be blamelessi bore it painfully and with imperfection however i go through it all because of the joy i have in be a nunwhen they saw me seek to be alone and even weep over my sin at time they think i be discontent and say so all religious observance have an attraction for me but i could notendure any which seem to make me contemptiblei delight in be think well of by other and be very exact in everything i have to doall this i think be a virtue though it will notserve a any excuse for me because i know what it be to procure my own satisfaction in everything and so ignorance do notblot out the blamethere may be some excuse in the fact that the monastery be notfound in great perfectioni wicked a i be follow after that which i saw be wrong and neglect that which be good there be then in the house a nun labouring under a most grievous and painful disorder for there be open ulcer in her body cause by certain obstruction through which her food be rejectedof this sickness she soon diedall the sister i saw be afraid of her maladyi envy her patience very much i pray to god that he would give me a like patience and then whatever sickness it might be hi pleasure to send i do notthink i be afraid of any for i be resolve on gain eternal good and determine to gain it by any and by every mean i be surprise at myself because then i have nota i believe that love of god which i think i have after i begin to praythen i have only light to see that all thing that pass away be to be lightly esteem and that the good thing to be gain by despise them be of great price because they be for everhis majesty heard me also in this for in less than two year i be so afflicted myself that the illness which i have though of a different kind from that of the sister be i really believe notless painful and try for the three year it last a i shall now relate when the time have come for which i be wait in the place i speak of before i be in my sister house for the purpose of undergo the medical treatmentthey take me away with the utmost care of my comfort that be my father my sister and the nun my friend who have come from the monastery with mefor her love for me be very greatat that moment satan begin to trouble my soul god however bring forth a great bless out of that trouble in the place to which i have go for my cure live a priest of good birth and understanding with some learn but notmuchi go to confession to him for i be always fond of learn men although confessor indifferently learn do my soul much harm for i do notalways find confessor whose learning be as good a i could wish it wasi know by experience that it be well if the confessor be good men and of holy life that they should have no learning at all than a little for such confessor never trust themselves without consult those who be learnednor would i trust them myself and a really learn confessor never deceive me neither do the other willingly deceive me only they know no good i think they be learn and that i be notunder any other obligation than that of believe them a their instruction to me be lax and leave me more at libertyfor if they have be strict with me i be so wicked i should have seek for othersthat which be a venial sin they tell me be no sin at all of that which be most grievously mortal they say it be venial this do me so much harm that it be no wonder i should speak of it here a a warning to other that they may avoid an evil so great for i see clearly that in the eye of god i be without excuse that the thing i do be in themselves notgood this should have be enough to keep me from themi believe that god by reason of my sin allow those confessor to deceive themselves and to deceive mei myself deceive many other by say to them what have be say to me i continue in this blindness i believe more than seventeen year till a most learned dominican father undeceive me in part and those of the company of jesus make me altogether so afraid by insist on the erroneousness of these principle a i shall hereafter show i begin then by go to confession to that priest of whom i speak before he take an extreme liking to me because i have then but little to confess in comparison with what i have afterwards and i have never much to say since i become a nunthere be no harm in the liking he have for me but it cease to be good because it be in excesshe clearly understood that i be determine on no account whatever to do anything whereby god might be seriously offendedhe too give me a like assurance about himself and accordingly our conference be manybut at that time through the knowledge and fear of god which fill my soul what give me most pleasure in all my conversation with other be to speak of god and a i be so young this make him ashamed and then out of that great goodwill he bore me he begin to tell me of hi wretched stateit be very sad for he have be nearly seven year in a most perilous condition because of hi affection for and conversation with a woman of that place and yet he use to say massthe matter be so public that hi honour and good name be lose and no one venture to speak to him about iti be extremely sorry for him because i like him muchi be then so imprudent and so blind a to think it a virtue to be grateful and loyal to one who like mecursed be that loyalty which reach so far a to go against the law of godit be a madness common in the world and it make me mad to see itwe be indebted to god for all the good that men do to u and yet we hold it to be an act of virtue notto break a friendship of this kind though it lead u to go against himoh blindness of the world let me o lord be most ungrateful to the world never at all unto theebut i have be altogether otherwise through my sin i procure further information about the matter from member of hi household i learn more of hi ruinous state and saw that the poor man fault be notso grave because the miserable woman have have recourse to enchantment by give him a little image make of copper which she have beg him to wear for love of her around hi neck and this no one have influence enough to persuade him to throw awayas to this matter of enchantment i do notbelieve it to be altogether true but i will relate what i saw by way of warn to men to be on their guard against woman who will do thing of this kindand let them be assure of this that womenfor they be more bound to purity than menif once they have lose all shame before god be in nothing whatever to be trust and that in exchange for the gratification of their will and of that affection which the devil suggest they will hesitate at nothing though i have be so wicked myself i never fell into anything of this kind nor do i ever attempt to do evil nor if i have the power would i have ever constrain any one to like me for our lord keep me from thisbut if he have abandon me i should have do wrong in this a i do in other thingsfor there be nothing in me whereon anyone may rely when i know this i begin to show him great affection my intention be good but the act be wrong for i ought notto do the least wrong for the sake of any good how great soever it may bei speak to him most frequently of god and this must have do him goodthough i believe that what touch him most be hi great affection for me because to do me a pleasure he give me that little image of copper and i have it at once throw into a riverwhen he have give it up like a man rouse from deep sleep he begin to consider all that he have do in those year and then amaze at himself lament hi ruinous state that woman come to be hateful in hi eyesour lady must have help him greatly for he have a very great devotion to her conception and use to keep the feast thereof with great solemnityin short he break off all relation with that woman utterly and be never weary of give god thanks for the light he have give him and at the end of the year from the day i first saw him he die he have be most diligent in the service of god and a for that great affection he have for me i never observe anything wrong in it though it might have be of great puritythere be also occasion wherein he might have most grievously offended if he have notkeep himself in the near presence of godas i say before i would notthen have do anything i know be a mortal sinand i think that observe this resolution in me help him to have that affection for me for i believe that all men must have a great affection for those woman whom they see dispose to be good and even for the attainment of earthly end woman must have more power over men because they be good a i shall show hereafteri be convince that the priest be in the way of salvationhe die most piously and completely withdrawn from that occasion of sinit seem that it be the will of our lord he should be save by these mean i remain three month in that place in the most grievous suffering for the treatment be too severe for my constitutionin two monthsso strong be the medicinesmy life be nearly wear out and the severity of the pain in the heart for the cure of which i be there be much more keen it seem to me now and then a if it have be seize by sharp teethso great be the torment that it be fear it might end in madnessthere be a great loss of strength for i could eat nothing whatever only drinki have a great loathing for food and a fever that never leave mei be so reduce for they have give me purgatives daily for nearly a month and so parch up that my sinew begin to shrinkthe pain i have be unendurable and i be overwhelm in a most deep sadness so that i have no rest either night or day this be the result and thereupon my father take me backthen the physician visit me againall give me up they say i be also consumptivethis give me little or no concern what distress me be the pain i hadfor i be in pain from my head down to my feetnow nervous pain accord to the physician be intolerable and all my nerve be shrunkcertainly if i have notbring this upon myself by my sin the torture would have be unendurable i be notmore than three month in this cruel distress for it seem impossible that so many ill could be borne togetheri now be astonish at myself and the patience hi majesty give mefor it clearly come from himi look upon a a great mercy of our lordit be a great help to me to be patient that i have read the story of job in the moral of stgregory our lord seem to have prepare me thereby and that i have begin the practice of prayer so that i might bear it all conform my will to the will of godall my conversation be with godi have continually these word of job in my thought and in my mouth if we have receive good thing of the hand of our lord why should we notreceive evil thing this seem to give me courage the feast of our lady in august come round from april until then i have be in great pain but more especially during the last three monthsi make haste to go to confession for i have always be very fond of frequent confessionthey think i be drive by the fear of death and so my father in order to quiet me would notsuffer me to gooh the unreasonable love of flesh and blood though it be that of a father so catholic and so wisehe be very much so and this act of hi could notbe the effect of any ignorance on hi partwhat evil it might have do me that very night my sickness become so acute that for about four day i remain insensiblethey administer the sacrament of the last anointing and every hour or rather every moment think i be die they do nothing but repeat the credo a if i could have understand anything they saidthey must have regard me a dead more than once for i find afterwards drop of wax on my eyelidsmy father because he have notallow me to go to confession be grievously distressedloud cry and many prayer be make to god bless be he who hear them for a dayandahalf the grave be open in my monastery wait for my body and the friar of our order in a house at some distance from this place perform funeral solemnitiesbut it please our lord i should come to myselfi wished to go to confession at oncei communicate with many tear but i do notthink those tear have their source in that pain and sorrow only for have offend god which might have suffice for my salvationunless indeed the delusion which i labour under be some excuse for me and into which i have be lead by those who have tell me that some thing be notmortal sin which afterwards i find be so certainly though my suffering be unendurable and my perception dull yet my confession i believe be complete a to all matter wherein i understand myself to have offend godthis grace among other do hi majesty bestow on me that ever since my first communion never in confession have i fail to confess anything i think to be a sin though it might be only a venial sinbut i think that undoubtedly my salvation be in great peril if i have die at that timepartly because my confessor be so unlearned and partly because i be so very wickedit be certainly true that when i think of it and consider how our lord seem to have raise me up from the dead i be so fill with wonder that i almost tremble with fear and now o my soul it be well for thee to look that danger in the face from which our lord deliver thee and if thou dost notcease to offend him out of love thou shouldst do so out of fearhe might have slay thee a thousand time and in a far more perilous statei believe i exaggerate nothing if i say a thousand times again though he may rebuke me who have command me to restrain myself in recount my sin and they be gloss over enoughi pray him for the love of god notto suppress one of my fault because herein shine forth the magnificence of god as well a hi longsuffering towards soulsmay he be bless for evermore and destroy me utterly rather than let me cease to love him any more the great debt she owe to our lord for hi mercy to hershe take stjoseph for her patron after those four day during which i be insensible so great be my distress that our lord alone knoweth the intolerable suffering i enduredmy tongue be bite to piece there be a choking in my throat because i have take nothing and because of my weakness so that i could notswallow even a drop of water all my bone seem to be out of joint and the disorder of my head be extremei be bent together like a coil of ropesfor to this be i bring by the torture of those daysunable to move either arm or foot or hand or head any more than if i have be dead unless other move me i could move however i think one finger of my right handthen a to touch me that be impossible for i be so bruised that i could notendure itthey use to move me in a sheet one hold one end and another the otherthis last till palm sunday the only comfort i have be thisif no one come near me my pain frequently cease and then because i have a little rest i consider myself well for i be afraid my patience would fail and thus i be exceedingly happy when i saw myself free from those pain which be so sharp and constant though in the cold fit of an intermittent fever which be most violent they be still unendurablemy dislike of food be very great i be now so anxious to return to my monastery that i have myself convey thither in the state i be inthere they receive alive one whom they have wait for a dead but her body be bad than dead the sight of it could only give painit be impossible to describe my extreme weakness for i be nothing but bonesi remain in this state a i have already say more than eight month and be paralytic though get good for about three yearsi praise god when i begin to crawl on my hand and kneesi bore all this with great resignation and if i except the beginning of my illness with great joy for all this be a nothing in comparison with the pain and torture i have to bear at firsti be resign to the will of god even if he leave me in this state for evermy anxiety about the recovery of my health seem to be ground on my desire to pray in solitude a i have be teach for there be no mean of do so in the infirmaryi go to confession most frequently spoke much about god and in such a way a to edify everyone and they all marvel at the patience which our lord give mefor if it have notcome from the hand of hi majesty it seem impossible to endure so great an affliction with so great a joy it be a great thing for me to have have the grace of prayer which god have work in me it make me understand what it be to love himin a little while i saw these virtue renew within me still they be notstrong for they be notsufficient to sustain me in justicei never speak ill in the slight degree whatever of any one and my ordinary practice be to avoid all detraction for i use to keep most carefully in mind that i ought notto assent to nor say of another anything i should notlike to have say of myselfi be extremely careful to keep this resolution on all occasion though notso perfectly upon some great occasion that present themselves a notto break it sometimesbut my ordinary practice be this and thus those who be about me and those with whom i converse become so convinced that it be right that they adopt it a a habitit come to be understood that where i be absent person be safe so they be also with my friend and kindred and with those whom i instructedstill for all this i have a strict account to give unto god for the bad example i give in other respectsmay it please hi majesty to forgive me for i have be the cause of much evil though notwith intention as perverse a be the act that follow the longing for solitude remain and i love to discourse and speak of god for if i find any one with whom i could do so it be a great joy and satisfaction to me than all the refinementsor rather to speak more correctly the real rudenessof the world conversationi communicate and confess more frequently still and desire to do so i be extremely fond of read good book i be most deeply penitent for have offend god and i remember that very often i do notdare to pray because i be afraid of that most bitter anguish which i felt for have offend god dread it a a great chastisementthis grow upon me afterwards to so great a degree that i know of no torment wherewith to compare it and yet it be neither more nor less because of any fear i have at any time for it come upon me only when i remember the consolation of our lord which he give me in prayer the great debt i owe him the evil return i make i could notbear iti be also extremely angry with myself on account of the many tear i shed for my fault when i saw how little i improve see that neither my good resolution nor the pain i take be sufficient to keep me from fall whenever i have the opportunityi look on my tear a a delusion and my fault therefore i regard a the more grievous because i saw the great goodness of our lord to me in the shedding of those tear and together with them such deep compunction i take care to go to confession as soon a i could and a i think do all that be possible on my part to return to a state of gracebut the whole evil lay in my notthoroughly avoid the occasion of sin and in my confessor who help me so littleif they have tell me that i be travel on a dangerous road and that i be bind to abstain from those conversation i believe without any doubt that the matter would have be remedied because i could notbear to remain even for one day in mortal sin if i know it all these token of the fear of god come to me through prayer and the great of them be this that fear be swallow up of lovefor i never think of chastisementall the time i be so ill my strict watch over my conscience reach to all that be mortal sin o my god i wish for health that i might serve thee good that be the cause of all my ruinfor when i saw how helpless i be through paralysis be still so young and how the physician of this world have deal with me i determine to ask those of heaven to heal mefor i wish nevertheless to be well though i bore my illness with great joysometimes too i use to think that if i recover my health and yet be lose for ever i be well a i wasbut for all that i think i might serve god much good if i be wellthis be our delusion we do notresign ourselves absolutely to the disposition of our lord who know best what be for our good i begin by have mass and prayer say for my intentionprayers that be highly sanction for i never like those other devotion which some people especially woman make use of with a ceremoniousness to me intolerable but which move them to be devouti have be give to understand since that they be unseemly and superstitious and i take for my patron and lord the glorious stjoseph and recommend myself earnestly to himi saw clearly that both out of this my present trouble and out of other of great importance relate to my honour and the loss of my soul this my father and lord deliver me and render me great service than i know how to ask fori can notcall to mind that i have ever ask him at any time for anything which he have notgrant and i be fill with amazement when i consider the great favour which god hath give me through this bless saint the danger from which he hath deliver me both of body and of soulto other saint our lord seem to have give grace to succour men in some special necessity but to this glorious saint i know by experience to help u in all and our lord would have u understand that a he be himself subject to him upon earthfor stjoseph have the title of father and be hi guardian could command himso now in heaven he perform all hi petitionsi have ask other to recommend themselves to stjoseph and they too know this by experience and there be many who be now of late devout to him have have experience of this truth i use to keep hi feast with all the solemnity i could but with more vanity than spirituality seek rather too much splendour and effect and yet with good intentionsi have this evil in me that if our lord give me grace to do any good that good become full of imperfection and of many fault but a for do wrong the indulgence of curiosity and vanity i be very skilful and active thereinour lord forgive me would that i could persuade all men to be devout to this glorious saint for i know by long experience what bless he can obtain for u from godi have never know any one who be really devout to him and who honour him by particular service who do notvisibly grow more and more in virtue for he help in a special way those soul who commend themselves to himit be now some year since i have always on hi feast ask him for something and i always have itif the petition be in any way amiss he direct it aright for my great good if i be a person who have authority to write it would be a pleasure to me to be diffusive in speak most minutely of the grace which this glorious saint have obtain for me and for othersbut that i may notgo beyond the commandment that be lay upon me i must in many thing be more brief than i could wish and more diffusive than be necessary in other for in short i be a person who in all that be good have but little discretionbut i ask for the love of god that he who do notbelieve me will make the trial for himselfwhen he will see by experience the great good that result from commend oneself to this glorious patriarch and be devout to himthose who give themselves to prayer should in a special manner have always a devotion to stjoseph for i know nothow any man can think of the queen of the angel during the time that she suffer so much with the infant jesus without give thanks to stjoseph for the service he render them thenhe who can notfind any one to teach him how to pray let him take this glorious saint for hi master and he will notwander out of the way may it please our lord that i have notdo amiss in venture to speak about stjoseph for though i publicly profess my devotion to him i have always fail in my service to him and imitation of himhe be like himself when he make me able to rise and walk no longer a paralytic and i too be like myself when i make so bad a use of this grace who could have say that i be so soon to fall after such great consolation from godafter hi majesty have implant virtue in me which of themselves make me serve himafter i have be a it be dead and in such extreme peril of eternal damnationafter he have raise me up soul and body so that all who saw me marvel to see me alive what can it mean o my lord the life we live be so full of danger while i be write thisand it seem to me too by thy grace and mercyi may say with stpaul though notso truly a he do it be noti who live now but thou my creator liv in me for some year past so it seem to me thou hast hold me by the hand and i see in myself desire and resolutionsin some measure test by experience in many way during that timenever to do anything however slight it may be contrary to thy will though i must have frequently offend thy divine majesty without be aware of it and i also think that nothing can be propose to me that i should notwith great resolution undertake for thy lovein some thing thou hast thyself help me to succeed thereini love neither the world nor the thing of the world nor do i believe that anything that do notcome from thee can give me pleasure everything els seem to me a heavy cross still i may easily deceive myself and it may be that i be notwhat i say i be but thou knowest o my lord that to the best of my knowledge i lie noti be afraid and with good reason l thou shouldst abandon me for i know now how far my strength and little virtue can reach if thou be notever at hand to supply them and to help me never to forsake theemay hi majesty grant that i be notforsake of thee even now when i be think all this of myself i know nothow we can wish to live see that everything be so uncertainonce o lord i think it impossible to forsake thee so utterly and now that i have forsake thee so often i can nothelp be afraid for when thou didst withdraw but a little from me i fell down to the ground at onceblessed for ever be thou though i have forsake thee thou hast notforsake me so utterly but that thou hast come again and raise me up give me thy hand alwaysvery often o lord i would nottake it very often i would notlisten when thou wert call me again a i be go to show lukewarmnessthe loss of graceinconvenience of laxity in religious house so then go on from pastime to pastime from vanity to vanity from one occasion of sin to another i begin to expose myself exceedingly to the very great danger my soul be so distract by many vanity that i be ashamed to draw near unto god in an act of such special friendship a that of prayer a my sin multiply i begin to lose the pleasure and comfort i have in virtuous thing and that loss contribute to the abandonment of prayeri see now most clearly o my lord that this comfort depart from me because i have depart from thee it be the most fearful delusion into which satan could plunge meto give up prayer under the pretence of humilityi begin to be afraid of give myself to prayer because i saw myself so losti think it would be good for me see that in my wickedness i be one of the most wicked to live like the multitudeto say the prayer which i be bind to say and that vocally notto practise mental prayer nor commune with god so much for i deserve to be with the devil and be deceive those who be about me because i make an outward show of goodness and therefore the community in which i dwell be notto be blame for with my cunning i so manage matter that all have a good opinion of me and yet i do notseek this deliberately by simulate devotion for in all that relate to hypocrisy and ostentationglory be to godi do notremember that i ever offend him so far a i knowthe very first movement herein give me such pain that the devil would depart from me with loss and the gain remain with me and thus accordingly he never tempt me much in this wayperhaps however if god have permit satan to tempt me a sharply herein a he tempt me in other thing i should have fall also into this but hi majesty have preserve me until nowmay he be bless for evermore it be rather a heavy affliction to me that i should be think so well of for i know my own secret the reason why they think i be notso wicked be this they saw that i who be so young and expose to so many occasion of sin withdraw myself so often into solitude for prayer read much spoke of god that i like to have hi image paint in many place to have an oratory of my own and furnish it with object of devotion that i speak ill of no one and other thing of the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtueyet all the whilei be so vaini know how to procure respect for myself by do those thing which in the world be usually regard with respect in consequence of this they give me a much liberty a they do to the old nun and even more and have great confidence in me for a to take any liberty for myself or do anything without leavesuch a converse through the door or in secret or by nighti do notthink i could have bring myself to speak with anybody in the monastery in that way and i never do it for our lord hold me backit seem to mefor i consider many thing carefully and of set purposethat it would be a very evil deed on my part wicked a i be to risk the credit of so many nun who be all goodas if everything els i do be well do in truth the evil i do be notthe result of deliberation a this would have be if i have do it although it be too much so therefore i think that it do me much harm to be in a monastery notenclosedthe liberty which those who be good might have with advantagethey notbe oblige to do more than they do because they have notbind themselves to enclosurewould certainly have lead me who be wicked straight to hell if our lord by so many remedy and mean of hi most singular mercy have notdeliver me out of that dangerand it be i believe the very great dangernamely a monastery of woman unenclosedyea more i think it be for those who will be wicked a road to hell rather than a help to their weaknessthis be notto be understood of my monastery for there be so many there who in the utmost sincerity and in great perfection serve our lord so that hi majesty accord to hi goodness can notbut be gracious unto them neither be it one of those which be most open for all religious observance be keep in it and i be speak only of other which i have see and know i be exceedingly sorry for these house because our lord must of necessity send hi special inspiration notmerely once but many time if the nun therein be to be save see that the honour and amusement of the world be allow among them and the obligation of their state be so illunderstoodgod grant they may notcount that to be virtue which be sin a i do so often it be very difficult to make people understand this it be necessary our lord himself should take the matter seriously into hi own hand if parent would take my advice now that they be at no pain to place their daughter where they may walk in the way of salvation without incur a great risk than they would do if they be leave in the world let them look at least at that which concern their good namelet them marry them to person of a much low degree rather than place them in monastery of this kind unless they be of extremely good inclination and god grant that these inclination may come to good or let them keep them at homeif they will be wicked at home their evil life can be hide only for a short time but in monastery it can be hide long and in the end it be our lord that discover itthey injure notonly themselves but all the nun alsoand all the while the poor thing be notin fault for they walk in the way that be show themmany of them be to be pity for they wish to withdraw from the world and thinking to escape from the danger of it and that they be go to serve our lord have find themselves in ten world at once without know what to do or how to help themselvesyouth and sensuality and the devil invite them and incline them to follow certain way which be of the essence of worldlinessthey see these way so to speak consider a safe there now these seem to me to be in some degree like those wretched heretic who will make themselves blind and who will consider that which they do to be good and so believe but without really believe for they have within themselves something that tell them it be wrong oh what utter ruin utter ruin of religious personsi be notspeak now more of woman than of menwhere the rule of the order be notkeep where the same monastery offer two roads one of virtue and observance the other of inobservance and both equally frequent i have speak incorrectly they be notequally frequent for on account of our sin the way of the great imperfection be the most frequented and because it be the broad it be also the most in favourthe way of religious observance be so little use that the friar and the nun who would really begin to follow their vocation thoroughly have reason to fear the member of their community more than all the devil togetherthey must be more cautious and dissemble more when they would speak of that friendship with god which they desire to have than when they would speak of those friendship and affection which the devil arrange in monasteriesi know notwhy we be astonish that the church be in so much trouble when we see those who ought to be an example of every virtue to other so disfigure the work which the spirit of the saint depart wrought in their ordersmay it please hi divine majesty to apply a remedy to this a he see it to be needful amen so then when i begin to indulge in these conversation i do notthink see they be customary that my soul must be injure and dissipate a i afterwards find it must be by such conversationsi think that a receive visit be so common in many monastery no more harm would befall me thereby than befell other whom i know to be goodi do notobserve that they be much good than i be and that an act which be perilous for me be notso perilous for them and yet i have no doubt there be some danger in it be it nothing els but a waste of time i be once with a personit be at the very beginning of my acquaintance with her when our lord be pleased to show me that these friendship be notgood for me to warn me also and in my blindness which be so great to give me lightchrist stand before me stern and grave give me to understand what in my conduct be offensive to himi saw him with the eye of the soul more distinctly than i could have see him with the eye of the bodythe vision make so deep an impression upon me that though it be more than twentysix year ago i seem to see him present even nowi be greatly astonish and disturb and i resolve notto see that person again it do me much harm that i do notthen know it be possible to see anything otherwise than with the eye of the body so do satan too in that he help me to think so he make me understand it to be impossible and suggest that i have imagine the visionthat it might be satan himselfand other supposition of that kindfor all this the impression remain with me that the vision be from god and notan imagination but a it be notto my liking i force myself to lie to myself and a i do notdare to discuss the matter with any one and a great importunity be use i go back to my former conversation with the same person and with other also at different time for i be assure that there be no harm in see such a person and that i gain instead of lose reputation by do soi spend many year in this pestilent amusement for it never appear to me when i be engage in it to be so bad a it really be though at time i saw clearly it be notgoodbut no one cause me the same distraction which that person do of whom i be speak and that be because i have a great affection for her at another time when i be with that person we saw both of u and other who be present also saw something like a great toad crawl towards u more rapidly than such a creature be in the habit of crawlingi can notunderstand how a reptile of that kind could in the middle of the day have come forth from that place it never have do so before but the impression it make on me be such that i think it must have have a meaning neither have i ever forget itoh the greatness of god with what care and tenderness didst thou warn me in every way and how little i profit by those warning there be in that house a nun who be relate to me now grow old a great servant of god and a strict observer of the ruleshe too warn me from time to time but i notonly do notlisten to her but be even offend thinking she be scandalize without causei have mention this in order that my wickedness and the great goodness of god might be understood and to show how much i deserve hell for ingratitude so great and moreover if it should be our lord will and pleasure that any nun at any time should read this that she might take warning by mei beseech them all for the love of our lord to flee from such recreation a these may hi majesty grant i may undeceive some one of the many i lead astray when i tell them there be no harm in these thing and assure them there be no such great danger thereini do so because i be blind myself for i would notdeliberately lead them astrayby the bad example i set before themi spoke of this before i be the occasion of much evil notthink i be do so much harm in those early day when i be ill and before i know how to be of use to myself i have a very strong desire to further the progress of other a most common temptation of beginnerswith me however it have good resultsloving my father so much i long to see him in the possession of that good which i seem to derive myself from prayeri think that in this life there could notbe a great good than prayer and by roundabout way as well a i could i contrive make him enter upon it i give him book for that endas he be so goodi say so before this exercise take such a hold upon him that in five or six year i think it be he make so great a progress that i use to praise our lord for itit be a very great consolation to mehe have most grievous trial of diverse kind and he bore them all with the great resignationhe come often to see me for it be a comfort to him to speak of the thing of god and now that i have become so dissipated and have cease to pray and yet saw that he still think i be what i use to be i could notendure it and so undeceived himi have be a year and more without pray think it an act of great humility to abstainthisi shall speak of it again be the great temptation i ever have because it very nearly wrought my utter ruin for when i use to pray if i offend god one day on the following day i would recollect myself and withdraw farther from the occasion of sin when that bless man have that good opinion of me come to visit me it pain me to see him so deceive a to think that i use to pray to god a beforeso i tell him that i do notpray but i do nottell him whyi put my infirmity forward a an excuse for though i have recover from that which be so troublesome i have always be weak even very much so and though my infirmity be somewhat less troublesome now than they be they still afflict me in many way specially i have be suffer for twenty year from sickness every morning so that i could nottake any food till past midday and even occasionally nottill later and now since my communion have become more frequent it be at night before i lie down to rest that the sickness occur and with great pain for i have to bring it on with a feather or other meansif i do notbring it on i suffer more and thus i be never i believe free from great pain which be sometimes very acute especially about the heart though the faintingfits be now but of rare occurrencei be also these eight year past free from the paralysis and from other infirmity of fever which i have so oftenthese affliction i now regard so lightly that i be even glad of them believe that our lord in some degree take hi pleasure in them my father believe me when i give him that for a reason a he never tell a lie himself neither should i have do so consider the relation we be ini tell him in order to be the more easily believe that it be much for me to be able to attend in choir though i saw clearly that this be no excuse whatever neither however be it a sufficient reason for give up a practice which do notrequire of necessity bodily strength but only love and a habit thereof yet our lord always furnish an opportunity for it if we but seek iti say always for though there may be time a in illness and from other cause when we can notbe much alone yet it never can be but there must be opportunity when our strength be sufficient for the purpose and in sickness itself and amidst other hindrance true prayer consist when the soul love in offer up it burden and in thinking of him for whom it suffer and in the resignation of the will and in a thousand way which then present themselvesit be under these circumstance that love exert itself for it be notnecessarily prayer when we be alone and neither be it notprayer when we be notwith a little care we may find great blessing on those occasion when our lord by mean of affliction deprives u of time for prayer and so i find it when i have a good consciencebut my father have that opinion of me which he have and because of the love he bore me believe all i tell him moreover he be sorry for me and a he have now rise to great height of prayer himself he never remain with me long for when he have see me he go hi way say that he be waste hi timeas i be waste it in other vanity i care little about this my father be notthe only person whom i prevail upon to practise prayer though i be walk in vanity myselfwhen i saw person fond of recite their prayer i show them how to make a meditation and help them and give them book for from the time i begin myself to pray a i say before i always have a desire that other should serve godi thought now that i do notmyself serve our lord accord to the light i have that the knowledge hi majesty have give me ought notto be lose and that other should serve him for me i say this in order to explain the great blindness i be in go to ruin myself and labour to save other at this time that illness befall my father of which he die it last some daysi go to nurse him be more sick in spirit than he be in body owe to my many vanitiesthough notso far a i know to the extent of be in mortal sinthrough the whole of that wretched time of which i be speak for if i know myself to be in mortal sin i would nothave continue in it on any accounti suffer much myself during hi illnessi believe i render him some service in return for what he have suffer in minethough i be very ill i do violence to myself and though in lose him i be to lose all the comfort and good of my lifehe be all this to mei be so courageous that i never betray my sorrow conceal them till he be dead a if i felt none at allit seem a if my very soul be wrench when i saw him at the point of deathmy love for him be so deep it be a matter for which we ought to praise our lordthe death that he die and the desire he have to die so also be the advice he give u after the last anointing how he charge u to recommend him to god and to pray for mercy for him how he bid u serve god always and consider how all thing come to an endhe tell u with tear how sorry he be that he have notserve him himself for he wish he be a friari mean that he have be one in the strictest order that isi have a most assured conviction that our lord some fifteen day before have reveal to him he be notto live for up to that time though very ill he do notthink so but now though he be somewhat good and the physician say so he give no heed to them but employ himself in the ordering of hi soul hi chief suffering consist in a most acute pain of the shoulder which never leave him it be so sharp at time that it put him into great torturei say to him that a he have so great a devotion to our lord carry hi cross on hi shoulder he should now think that hi majesty wish him to feel somewhat of that pain which he then suffer himselfthis so comfort him that i do notthink i hear him complain afterwards he remain three day without consciousness but on the day he die our lord restore him so completely that we be astonish he preserve hi understanding to the last for in the middle of the creed which he repeat himself he diedhe lay there like an angelsuch he seem to me if i may sayso both in soul and disposition he be very good i know notwhy i have say this unless it be for the purpose of show how much the more i be to be blame for my wickedness for after see such a death and know what hi life have be i in order to be in any wise like unto such a father ought to have grow betterhis confessor a most learned dominican use to say that he have no doubt he go straight to heaven he have hear hi confession for some year and speak with praise of the purity of hi conscience this dominican father who be a very good man fear god do me a very great service for i confess to himhe take upon himself the task of help my soul in earnest and of make me see the perilous state i be in he send me to communion once a fortnight and i by degree begin to speak to him tell him about my prayerhe charge me never to omit it that anyhow it could notdo me anything but goodi begin to return to itthough i do notcut off the occasion of sinand never afterwards give it upmy life become most wretched because i learn in prayer more and more of my faultson one side god be call me on the other i be follow the worldall the thing of god give me great pleasure and i be a prisoner to the thing of the worldit seem a if i wish to reconcile two contradiction so much at variance one with another a be the life of the spirit and the joy and pleasure and amusement of sense i suffer much in prayer for the spirit be slave and notmaster and so i be notable to shut myself up within myselfthat be my whole method of prayerwithout shut up with me a thousand vanity at the same timei spend many year in this way and i be now astonish that any one could have bear it without abandon either the one or the otheri know well that it be notin my power then to give up prayer because he hold me in hi hand who seek me that he might show me great mercy o my god if i might i would speak of the occasion from which god deliver me and how i throw myself into them again and of the risk i run of lose utterly my good name from which he deliver mei do thing to show what i be and our lord hide the evil and reveal some little virtueif so be i have anyand make it great in the eye of all so that they always hold me in much honourfor although my folly come occasionally into light people would notbelieve it when they saw other thing which they think goodthe reason be that he who knoweth all thing saw it be necessary it should be so in order that i might have some credit give me by those to whom in after year i be to speak of hi servicehis supreme munificence regard notmy great sin but rather the desire i frequently have to please him and the pain i felt because i have notthe strength to bring those desire to good effect o lord of my soul how shall i be able to magnify the grace which thou in those year didst bestow upon me oh how at the very time that i offend thee most thou didst prepare me in a moment by a most profound compunction to taste of the sweetness of thy consolation and mercy in truth o my king thou didst administer to me the most delicate and painful chastisement it be possible for me to bear for thou knewest well what would have give me the most painthou didst chastise my sin with great consolationsi do notbelieve i be say foolish thing though it may well be that i be beside myself whenever i call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness it be more painful for me in the state i be in to receive grace when i have fall into grievous fault than it would have be to receive chastisement for one of those fault i be sure use to bring me low shame and distress me more than many disease together with many heavy trial could have donefor a to the latter i saw that i deserve them and it seem to me that by them i be make some reparation for my sin though it be but slight for my sin be so manybut when i see myself receive grace anew after be so ungrateful for those already receive that be to meand i believe to all who have any knowledge or love of goda fearful kind of tormentwe may see how true this be by consider what a virtuous mind must behence my tear and vexation when i reflect on what i felt see myself in a condition to fall at every moment though my resolution and desire theni be speaking of that timewere strong it be a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst of such great danger it seem to me that if i have have any one with whom i could have speak of all this it might have help me notto falli might at least have be ashamed before himand yet i be notashamed before god for this reason i would advise those who give themselves to prayer particularly at first to form friendship and converse familiarly with other who be do the same thingit be a matter of the last importance even if it lead only to help one another by prayer how much more see that it have lead to much great gain now if in their intercourse one with another and in the indulgence of human affection even notof the best kind men seek friend with whom they may refresh themselves and for the purpose of have great satisfaction in speaking of their empty joy i know no reason why it should notbe lawful for him who be begin to love and serve god in earnest to confide to another hi joy and sorrow for they who be give to prayer be thoroughly accustom to both for if that friendship with god which he desire be real let him notbe afraid of vainglory and if the first movement thereof assail him he will escape from it with merit and i believe that he who will discuss the matter with this intention will profit both himself and those who hear him and thus will derive more light for hi own understanding as well a for the instruction of hi friendshe who in discuss hi method of prayer fall into vainglory will do so also when he hear mass devoutly if he be see of men and in do other good work which must be do under pain of be no christian and yet these thing must notbe omit through fear of vainglory moreover it be a most important matter for those soul who be notstrong in virtue for they have so many people enemy as well a friend to urge them the wrong way that i do notsee how this point be capable of exaggerationit seem to me that satan have employ this artificeand it be of the great service to himnamely that men who really wish to love and please god should hide the fact while other at hi suggestion make open show of their malicious disposition and this be so common that it seem a matter of boast now and the offence commit against god be thus publish abroad i do notknow whether the thing i be say be foolish or notif they be so your reverence will strike them outi entreat you to help my simplicity by add a good deal to this because the thing that relate to the service of god be so feebly manage that it be necessary for those who would serve him to join shoulder to shoulder if they be to advance at all for it be consider safe to live amidst the vanity and pleasure of the world and few there be who regard them with unfavourable eyesbut if any one begin to give himself up to the service of god there be so many to find fault with him that it become necessary for him to seek companion in order that he may find protection among them till he grow strong enough notto feel what he may be make to sufferif he do nothe will find himself in great strait this i believe must have be the reason why some of the saint withdraw into the desertand it be a kind of humility in man notto trust to himself but to believe that god will help him in hi relation with those with whom he converse and charity grows by be diffuse and there be a thousand blessing herein which i would notdare to speak of if i have notknow by experience the great importance of itit be very true that i be the most wicked and the base of all who be bear of woman but i believe that he who humble himself though strong yet trusteth notin himself and believeth another who in this matter have have experience will lose nothingof myself i may say that if our lord have notreveal to me this truth and give me the opportunity of speak very frequently to person give to prayer i should have go on fall and rise till i tumble into helli have many friend to help me to fall but a to rise again i be so much left to myself that i wonder now i be notalways on the groundi praise god for hi mercy for it be he only who stretch out hi hand to memay he be bless for ever amen the saint cease notto prayprayer the way to recover what be lostall exhorted to praythe great advantage of prayer even to those who may have cease from it it be notwithout reason that i have dwell so long on this portion of my lifei see clearly that it will give no one pleasure to see anything so base and certainly i wish those who may read this to have me in abhorrence a a soul so obstinate and so ungrateful to him who do so much for mei could wish too i have permission to say how often at this time i fail in my duty to god because i be notlean on the strong pillar of prayeri pass nearly twenty year on this stormy sea fall and rise but rise to no good purpose see that i go and fell againmy life be one of perfection but it be so mean that i scarcely make any account whatever of venial sin and though of mortal sin i be afraid i be notso afraid of them a i ought to have be because i do notavoid the perilous occasion of themi may say that it be the most painful life that can be imagine because i have no sweetness in god and no pleasure in the world when i be in the midst of the pleasure of the world the remembrance of what i owe to god make me sad and when i be pray to god my worldly affection disturb methis be so painful a struggle that i know nothow i could have bear it for a month let alone for so many yearsnevertheless i can trace distinctly the great mercy of our lord to me while thus immerse in the world in that i have still the courage to prayi say courage because i know of nothing in the whole world which require great courage than plot treason against the king knowing that he know it and yet never withdraw from hi presence for grant that we be always in the presence of god yet it seem to me that those who pray arc in hi presence in a very different sense for they a it be see that he be look upon them while other may be for day together without even once recollect that god see them it be true indeed that during these year there be many month and i believe occasionally a whole year in which i so keep guard over myself that i do notoffend our lord give myself much to prayer and take some pain and that successfully notto offend himi speak of this now because all i be say be strictly true but i remember very little of those good day and so they must have be few while my evil day be manystill the day that pass over without my spending a great part of them in prayer be few unless i be very ill or very much occupy when i be ill i be well with godi contrive that those about me should be so too and i make supplication to our lord for this grace and speak frequently of himthus with the exception of that year of which i have be speak during eightandtwenty year of prayer i spend more than eighteen in that strife and contention which arise out of my attempt to reconcile god and the worldas to the other year of which i have now to speak in them the ground of the warfare though it be notslight be change but inasmuch a i wasat least i think soserving god and aware of the vanity of the world all have be pleasant a i shall show hereafter the reason then of my tell this at so great a length be that a i have just say the mercy of god and my ingratitude on the one hand may become known and on the other that men may understand how great be the good which god work in a soul when he give it a disposition to pray in earnest though it may notbe so well prepared a it ought to beif that soul perseveres in spite of sin temptation and relapse bring about in a thousand way by satan our lord will bring it at lasti be certain of itto the harbour of salvation a he have bring me myself for so it seem to me nowmay hi majesty grant i may never go back and be lose he who give himself to prayer be in possession of a great blessing of which many saintly and good men have writteni be speak of mental prayerglory be to god for it and if they have notdo so i be notproud enough though i have but little humility to presume to discuss it i may speak of that which i know by experience and so i say let him never cease from prayer who have once begin it be hi life ever so wicked for prayer be the way to amend it and without prayer such amendment will be much more difficultlet him notbe tempt by satan a i be to give it up on the pretence of humility let him rather believe that hi word be true who say that if we truly repent and resolve never to offend him he will take u into hi favour again give u the grace he give u before and occasionally even great if our repentance deserve itand a to him who have notbegin to pray i implore him by the love of our lord notto deprive himself of so great a good herein there be nothing to be afraid of but everything to hope forgranting that such a one do notadvance nor make an effort to become perfect so a to merit the joy and consolation which the perfect receive from god yet he will by little and little attain to a knowledge of the road which lead to heavenand if he persevere i hope in the mercy of god for him see that no one ever take him for hi friend that be notamply reward for mental prayer be nothing els in my opinion but be on term of friendship with god frequently converse in secret with him who we know love usnow true love and lasting friendship require certain disposition those of our lord we know be absolutely perfect ours vicious sensual and thankless and you can nottherefore bring yourselves to love him a he love you because you have notthe disposition to do so and if you do notlove him yet see how much it concern you to have hi friendship and how great be hi love for you rise above that pain you feel at be much with him who be so different from you o infinite goodness of my god i seem to see thee and myself in this relation to one anothero joy of the angel when i consider it i wish i could wholly die of love how true it be that thou endurest those who will notendure thee oh how good a friend art thou o my lord how thou comfortest and endurest and also waitest for them to make themselves like unto thee and yet in the meanwhile art thyself so patient of the state they be in thou takest into account the occasion during which they seek thee and for a moment of penitence forgettesttheir offence against thyself i have see this distinctly in my own case and i can nottell why the whole world do notlabour to draw near to thee in this particular friendshipthe wicked who do notresemble thee ought to do so in order that thou mayest make them good and for that purpose should permit thee to remain with them at least for two hour daily even though they may notremain with thee but a i use to do with a thousand distraction and with worldly thoughtsin return for this violence which they offer to themselves for the purpose of remain in a company so good a thinefor at first they can do no more and even afterwards at timesthou o lord defendest them against the assault of evil spirit whose power thou restrainest and even lessenest daily give to them the victory over these their enemiesso it be o life of all life thou slayest none that put their trust in thee and seek thy friendship yea rather thou sustainest their bodily life in great vigour and makest their soul to live i do notunderstand what there can be to make them afraid who be afraid to begin mental prayer nor do i know what it be they dreadthe devil do well to bring this fear upon u that he may really hurt u by put me in fear he can make me cease from thinking of my offence against god of the great debt i owe him of the existence of heaven and hell and of the great sorrow and trial he undergo for methat be all my prayer and have be when i be in this dangerous state and it be on those subject i dwell whenever i could and very often for some year i be more occupied with the wish to see the end of the time i have appoint for myself to spend in prayer and in watch the hourglass than with other thought that be goodif a sharp penance have be lay upon me i know of none that i would notvery often have willingly undertake rather than prepare myself for prayer by selfrecollectionand certainly the violence with which satan assail me be so irresistible or my evil habit be so strong that i do notbetake myself to prayer and the sadness i felt on enter the oratory be so great that it require all the courage i have to force myself inthey say of me that my courage be notslight and it be know that god have give me a courage beyond that of a woman but i have make a bad use of itin the end our lord come to my help and then when i have do this violence to myself i find great peace and joy than i sometimes have when i have a desire to pray if then our lord bore so long with me who be so wickedand it be plain that it be by prayer all my evil be correctedwhy should any one how wicked soever he may be have any fear let him be ever so wicked he will notremain in hi wickedness so many year a i do after receive so many grace from our lordis there any one who can despair when he bore so long with me only because i desire and contrive to find some place and some opportunity for him to be alone with meand that very often against my will for i do violence to myself or rather our lord himself do violence to me if then to those who do notserve god but rather offend him prayer be all this and so necessary and if no one can really find out any harm it can do him and if the omission of it be nota still great harm why then should they abstain from it who serve and desire to serve god certainly i can notcomprehend it unless it be that men have a mind to go through the trouble of this life in great misery and to shut the door in the face of god so that he shall give them no comfort in iti be most truly sorry for them because they serve god at their own cost for of those who pray god himself defray the charge see that for a little trouble he give sweetness in order that by the help it supply they may bear their trial but because i have much to say hereafter of this sweetness which our lord give to those who persevere in prayer i do notspeak of it here only this will i say prayer be the door to those great grace which our lord bestow upon meif this door be shut i do notsee how he can bestow them for even if he enter into a soul to take hi delight therein and to make that soul also delight in him there be no way by which he can do so for hi will be that such a soul should be lonely and pure with a great desire to receive hi gracesif we put many hindrance in the way and take no pain whatever to remove them how can he come to u and how can we have any desire that he should show u hi great mercy i will speak nowfor it be very important to understand itof the assault which satan direct against a soul for the purpose of take it and of the contrivance and compassion wherewith our lord labour to convert it to himself in order that men may behold hi mercy and the great good it be for me that i do notgive up prayer and spiritual reading and that they may be on their guard against the danger against which i be noton my guard myselfand above all i implore them for the love of our lord and for the great love with which he goeth about seek our conversion to himself to beware of the occasion of sin for once place therein we have no ground to rest onso many enemy then assail u and our own weakness be such that we can notdefend ourselves oh that i know how to describe the captivity of my soul in those day i understand perfectly that i be in captivity but i could notunderstand the nature of it neither could i entirely believe that those thing which my confessor do notmake so much of be so wrong a i in my soul felt them to beone of themi have go to him with a scrupletold me that even if i be raise to high contemplation those occasion and conversation be notunfit for methis be towards the end when by the grace of god i be withdraw more and more from those great danger but notwholly from the occasion of them when they saw my good desire and how i occupy myself in prayer i seem to them to have do much but my soul know that this be notdo what i be bind to do for him to whom i owe so muchi be sorry for my poor soul even now because of it great suffering and the little help it have from any one except god and for the wide door that man open for it that it might go forth to it pastime and pleasure when they say that these thing be lawful then there be the torture of sermon and that nota slight one for i be very fond of themif i hear any one preach well and with unction i felt without my seek it a particular affection for him neither do i know whence it camethus no sermon ever seem to me so bad but that i listen to it with pleasure though accord to other who hear it the preaching be notgoodif it be a good sermon it be to me a most special refreshmentto speak of god or to hear him spoken of never weary mei be speaking of the time after i give myself to prayerat one time i have great comfort in sermon at another they distress me because they make me feel that i be very far from be what i ought to have be i use to pray to our lord for help but a it now seem to me i must have commit the fault of notput my whole trust in hi majesty and of notthoroughly distrust myselfi seek for help take great pain but it must be that i do notunderstand how all be of little profit if we do notroot out all confidence in ourselves and place it wholly in godi wish to live but i saw clearly that i be notlive but rather wrestle with the shadow of death there be no one to give me life and i be notable to take ithe who could have give it me have good reason for notcome to my aid seeing that he have bring me back to himself so many time and i as often have leave him the mean whereby our lord quicken her soul gave her light in her darkness and make her strong in goodness my soul be now grown weary and the miserable habit it have contract would notsuffer it to rest though it be desirous of do soit come to pass one day when i go into the oratory that i saw a picture which they have put by there and which have be procure for a certain feast observe in the houseit be a representation of christ most grievously wounded and so devotional that the very sight of it when i saw it move meso well do it show forth that which he suffer for usso keenly do i feel the evil return i have make for those wound that i think my heart be breakingi throw myself on the ground beside it my tear flow plenteously and implore him to strengthen me once for all so that i might never offend him any more i have a very great devotion to the glorious magdalen and very frequently use to think of her conversionespecially when i go to communionas i know for certain that our lord be then within me i use to place myself at hi foot think that my tear would notbe despisedi do notknow what i be say only he do great thing for me in that he be pleased i should shed those tear see that i so soon forget that impressioni use to recommend myself to that glorious saint that she might obtain my pardon but this last time before that picture of which i be speak i seem to have make great progress for i be now very distrustful of myself place all my confidence in godit seem to me that i say to him then that i would notrise up till he grant my petitioni do certainly believe that this be of great service to me because i have grow well ever since this be my method of prayer a i could notmake reflection with my understanding i contrive to picture christ a within me and i use to find myself the good for thinking of those mystery of hi life during which he be most lonelyit seem to me that the be alone and afflict like a person in trouble must need permit me to come near unto him i do many simple thing of this kind and in particular i use to find myself most at home in the prayer in the garden whither i go in hi companyi thought of the bloody sweat and of the affliction he endure there i wish if it have be possible to wipe away that painful sweat from hi face but i remember that i never dare to form such a resolutionmy sin stand before me so grievouslyi use to remain with him there as long a my thought allow me and i have many thought to torment mefor many year nearly every night before i fell asleep when i recommend myself to god that i might sleep in peace i use always to think a little of this mystery of the prayer in the gardenyea even before i be a nun because i have be tell that many indulgence be to be gain therebyfor my part i believe that my soul gain very much in this way because i begin to practise prayer without know what it be and now that it have become my constant habit i be save from omit it a i be from omit to bless myself with the sign of the cross before i sleep and now to go back to what i be say of the torture which my thought inflict upon methis method of pray in which the understanding make no reflection hath this property the soul must gain much or losei mean that those who advance without meditation make great progress because it be do by lovebut to attain to this involve great labour except to those person whom it be our lord good pleasure to lead quickly to the prayer of quieti know of somefor those who walk in this way a book be profitable that by the help thereof they may the more quickly recollect themselvesit be a help to me also to look on field water and flower in them i saw trace of the creatori mean that the sight of these thing be a a book unto me it rouse me make me recollected and remind me of my ingratitude and of my sinsmy understanding be so dull that i could never represent in the imagination either heavenly or high thing in any form whatever until our lord place them before me in another way i be so little able to put thing before me by the help of my understanding that unless i saw a thing with my eye my imagination be of no use whateveri could notdo a other do who can put matter before themselves so a to become thereby recollectedi be able to think of christ only as manbut so it be and i never could form any image of him to myself though i read much of hi beauty and look at picture of himi be like one who be blind or in the dark who though speaking to a person present and feel hi presence because he know for certain that he be presenti mean that he understand him to be present and believe ityet do notsee himit be thus with me when i use to think of our lordthis be why i be so fond of imageswretched be they who through their own fault have lose this bless it be clear enough that they do notlove our lordfor if they love him they would rejoice at the sight of hi picture just a men find pleasure when they see the portrait of one they love at this time the confession of staugustine be give meour lord seem to have so ordain it for i do notseek them myself neither have i ever see them beforei have a very great devotion to staugustine because the monastery in which i live when i be yet in the world be of hi order and also because he have be a sinnerfor i use to find great comfort in those saint whom after they have sin our lord convert to himselfi thought they would help me and that a our lord have forgive them so also he would forgive meone thing however there be that troubled mei have speak of it before our lord have call them but once and they never relapse while my relapse be now so manythis it be that vexed mebut call to mind the love that he bore me i take courage againof hi mercy i never doubt once but i do very often of myself o my god i amaze at the hardness of my heart amidst so many succour from theei be fill with dread when i see how little i could do with myself and how i be clog so that i could notresolve to give myself entirely to godwhen i begin to read the confession i think i saw myself there describe and begin to recommend myself greatly to this glorious saintwhen i come to hi conversion and read how he hear that voice in the garden it seem to me nothing less than that our lord have utter it for me i felt so in my hearti remain for some time lose in tear in great inward affliction and distresso my god what a soul have to suffer because it have lose the liberty it have of be mistress over itself and what torment it have to endure i wonder now how i could live in torment so great god be praise who give me life so that i might escape from so fatal a death i believe that my soul obtain great strength from hi divine majesty and that he must have hear my cry and have compassion upon so many tear a desire to spend more time with him begin to grow within me and also to withdraw from the occasion of sin for as soon a i have do so i turn lovingly to hi majesty at oncei understood clearly a i think that i love him but i do notunderstand a i ought to have understood it wherein the true love of god consistsi do notthink i have yet perfectly dispose myself to seek hi service when hi majesty turn towards me with hi consolationswhat other strive after with great labour our lord seem to have look out for a way to make me willing to acceptthat be in these late year to give me joy and comfortbut a for ask our lord to give me either these thing or sweetness in devotion i never dare to do it the only thing i pray him to give me be the grace never to offend him together with the forgiveness of my great sinswhen i saw that my sin be so great i never venture deliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetnesshe have compassion enough upon me i thinkand in truth he deal with me accord to hi great mercywhen he allow me to stand before him and when he draw me into hi presence for i saw that if he have notdraw me i should nothave come at all once only in my life do i remember ask for consolation be at the time in great ariditieswhen i consider what i have do i be so confounded that the very distress i suffer from see how little humility i have bring me that which i have be so bold a to ask fori knew well that it be lawful to pray for it but it seem to me that it be lawful only for those who be in good disposition who have seek with all their might to attain to true devotionthat be notto offend god and to be dispose and resolve for all goodnessi look upon those tear of mine a womanish and weak seeing that i do notobtain my desire by them nevertheless i believe that they do me some service for specially after those two occasion of great compunction and sorrow of heart accompany by tear of which i be speak i begin in an especial way to give myself more to prayer and to occupy myself less with those thing which do me harmthough i do notgive them up altogetherbut god himself a i have just say come to my aid and help me to turn away from themas hi majesty be only wait for some preparation on my part the spiritual grace grow in me a i shall now explainit be notthe custom of our lord to give these grace to any but to those who keep their conscience in great pureness the grace she receive in prayerwhat we can do ourselvesthe great importance of understand what our lord be do for usshe desire her confessor to keep her writing secret because of the special grace of our lord to her which they have command her to describe i use to have at time a i have say though it use to pass quickly awaycertain commencement of that which i be go now to describewhen i form those picture within myself of throw myself at the foot of christ a i say before and sometimes even when i be read a feeling of the presence of god would come over me unexpectedly so that i could in no wise doubt either that he be within me or that i be wholly absorb in himit be notby way of vision i believe it be what be call mystical theologythe soul be suspend in such a way that it seem to be utterly beside itselfthe will love the memory so it seem to me be a it be lose and the understanding so i think make no reflectionsyet be notlose a i have just say it be notat work but it stand a if amaze at the greatness of the thing it understand for god will it to understand that it understand nothing whatever of that which hi majesty place before it before this i have a certain tenderness of soul which be very abide partially attainable i believe in some measure by our own effort a consolation which be notwholly in the sens nor yet altogether in the spirit but be all of it the gift of godhowever i think we can contribute much towards the attaining of it by consider our vileness and our ingratitude towards godthe great thing he have do for ushis passion with it grievous painsand hi life so full of sorrow also by rejoice in the contemplation of hi work of hi greatness and of the love that he bear usmany other consideration there be which he who really desire to make progress will often stumble on though he may notbe very much on the watch for themif with this there be a little love the soul be comfort the heart be soften and tear flowsometimes it seem that we do violence to ourselves and weep at other time our lord seem to do so so that we have no power to resist himhis majesty seem to reward this slight carefulness of ours with so grand a gift a be this consolation which he minister to the soul of see itself weep for so great a lordi be notsurprise for the soul have reason enough and more than enough for it joyhere it comfort itselfhere it rejoice the comparison which now present itself seem to me to be goodthese joy in prayer be like what those of heaven must beas the vision of the saint which be measure by their merit there reach no further than our lord will and a the bless see how little merit they have every one of them be satisfy with the place assign him there be the very great difference between one joy and another in heaven and much great than between one spiritual joy and another on earthwhich be however very greatand in truth in the begin a soul in which god work this grace think that now it have scarcely anything more to desire and count itself abundantly reward for all the service it have render himand there be reason for this for one of those tearswhich a i have just say be almost in our own power though without god nothing can be donecannot in my opinion be purchase with all the labour of the world because of the great gain it bring usand what great gain can we have than some testimony of our have please god let him then who shall have attain to this give praise unto godacknowledge himself to be one of hi great debtor because it seem to be hi will to take him into hi house have choose him for hi kingdom if he do notturn back let him notregard certain kind of humility which exist and of which i mean to speak some think it humility notto believe that god be bestow hi gift upon themlet u clearly understand this and that it be perfectly clear god bestow hi gift without any merit whatever on our part and let u be grateful to hi majesty for them for if we do notrecognize the gift receive at hi hand we shall never be move to love himit be a most certain truth that the rich we see ourselves to be confess at the same time our poverty the great will be our progress and the more real our humility an opposite course tend to take away all courage for we shall think ourselves incapable of great blessing if we begin to frighten ourselves with the dread of vainglory when our lord begin to show hi mercy upon u let u believe that he who give these gift will also when the devil begin to tempt u herein give u the grace to detect him and the strength to resist himthat be he will do so if we walk in simplicity before god aim at please him only and notmenit be a most evident truth that our love for a person be great the more distinctly we remember the good he have do u if then it be lawful and so meritorious always to remember that we have our be from god that he have create u out of nothing that he preserve u and also to remember all the benefit of hi death and passion which he suffer long before he make u for every one of u now alivewhy should it notbe lawful for me to discern confess and consider often that i be once accustom to speak of vanity and that now our lord have give me the grace to speak only of himself here then be a precious pearl which when we remember that it be give u and that we have it in possession powerfully invite u to loveall this be the fruit of prayer found on humilitywhat then will it be when we shall find ourselves in possession of other pearl of great price such a contempt of the world and of self which some servant of god have already receive it be clear that such soul must consider themselves great debtorsunder great obligation to serve him we must acknowledge that we have nothing of ourselves and confess the munificence of our lord who on a soul so wretched and poor and so utterly undeserving a mine isfor whom the first of these pearl be enough and more than enoughwould bestow great rich than i could desire we must renew our strength to serve him and strive notto be ungrateful because it be on this condition that our lord dispense hi treasure for if we do notmake a good use of them and of the high estate to which he raise u he will return and take them from u and we shall be poor than everhis majesty will give the pearl to him who shall bring them forth and employ them usefully for himself and othersfor how shall he be useful and how shall he spend liberally who do notknow that he be rich it be notpossible i think our nature be what it be that he can have the courage necessary for great thing who do notknow that god be on hi side for so miserable be we so incline to the thing of this world that he can hardly have any real abhorrence of with great detachment from all earthly thing who do notsee that he hold some pledge for those thing that be aboveit be by these gift that our lord give u that strength which we through our sin have lose a man will hardly wish to be hold in contempt and abhorrence nor will he seek after the other great virtue to which the perfect attain if he have notsome pledge of the love which god bear him together with a live faithour nature be so dead that we go after that which we see immediately before u and it be these grace therefore that quicken and strengthen our faithit may well be that i who be so wicked measure other by myself and that other require nothing more than the verity of the faith in order to render their work most perfect while i wretched that i be have need of everything other will explain thisi speak from my own experience a i have be command and if what i say be notcorrect let him to whom i send it destroy it for he know good than i do what be wrong in iti entreat him for the love of our lord to publish abroad what i have thus far say of my wretched life and of my sinsi give him leave to do so and to all my confessor alsoof whom he be oneto whom this be to be send if it be their pleasure even during my life so that i may no longer deceive people who think there must be some good in me certainly i speak in all sincerity so far a i understand myselfsuch publication will give me great comfort but a to that which i be now go to say i give no such leave nor if it be show to any one do i consent to it be say who the person be whose experience it describe nor who write itthis be why i mention neither my own name nor that of any other person whateveri have write it in the best way i could in order notto be know and this i beg of them for the love of godpersons so learn and grave a they be have authority enough to approve of whatever right thing i may say should our lord give me the grace to do so and if i should say anything of the kind it will be hi and notminebecause i be neither learn nor of good life and i have no person of learn or any other to teach me for they only who order me to write know that i be write and at this moment they be notherei have a it be to steal the time and that with difficulty because my writing hinders me from spinningi be live in a house that be poor and have many thing to do if indeed our lord have give me great ability and a good memory i might then profit by what i have see and read but my ability be very slightif then i should say anything that be right our lord will have it say for some good purpose that which may be wrong will be mine and your reverence will strike it out in neither case will it be of any use to publish my name during my life it be clear that no good i may have do ought to be tell after death there be no reason against it except that it will lose all authority and credit because relate of a person so vile and so wicked a i amand because i think your reverence and the other who may see this writing will do this that i ask of you for the love of our lord i write with freedomif it be notso i should have great scruple except in declare my sin and in that matter i should have none at allfor the rest it be enough that i be a woman to make my sail droop how much more then when i be a woman and a wicked one so then everything here beyond the simple story of my life your reverence must take upon yourselfsince you have so press me to give some account of the grace which our lord bestow upon me in prayerif it be consistent with the truth of our holy catholic faith if it be notyour reverence must burn it at oncefor i give my consenti will recount my experience in order that if it be consistent with those truth your reverence may make some use of it if notyou will deliver my soul from delusion so that satan may gain nothing there where i seem to be gain myselfour lord know well that i a i shall show hereafter have always labour to find out those who could give me light how clear soever i may wish to make my account of that which relate to prayer it will be obscure enough for those who be without experiencei shall speak of certain hindrance which a i understand it keep men from advance on this roadand of other thing which be dangerous a our lord have teach me by experiencei have also discuss the matter with men of great learn with person who for many year have live spiritual life who admit that in the twentyseven year only during which i have give myself to prayerthough i walk so ill and stumble so often on the roadhis majesty grant me that experience which other attain to in sevenandthirty or sevenandforty year and they too be person who ever advance in the way of penance and of virtue bless be god for all and may hi infinite majesty make use of me our lord knoweth well that i have no other end in this than that he may be praise and magnify a little when men shall see that on a dunghill so foul and rank he have make a garden of flower so sweetmay it please hi majesty that i may notby my own fault root them out and become again what i be beforeand i entreat your reverence for the love of our lord to beg this of him for me see that you have a clear knowledge of what i be than you have allow me to give of myself here why men do notattain quickly to the perfect love of godof four degree of prayerof the first degreethe doctrine profitable for beginner and for those who have no sensible sweetness i speak now of those who begin to be the servant of love that seem to me to be nothing els but to resolve to follow him in the way of prayer who have love u so muchit be a dignity so great that i have a strange joy in thinking of it for servile fear vanishes at once if we be a we ought to be in the first degreeo lord of my soul and my good how be it that when a soul be determine to love theedoing all it can by forsake all thing in order that it may the good occupy itself with the love of godit be notthy will it should have the joy of ascend at once to the possession of perfect love i have speak amiss i ought to have say and my complaint should have be why be it we do notfor the fault be wholly our own that we do notrejoice at once in a dignity so great see that the attaining to the perfect possession of this true love bring all blessing with it we think so much of ourselves and be so dilatory in give ourselves wholly to god that a hi majesty will notlet u have the fruition of that which be so precious but at a great cost so neither do we perfectly prepare ourselves for iti see plainly that there be nothing by which so great a good can be procure in this worldif however we do what we could notcling to anything upon earth but have all our thought and conversation in heaven i believe that this blessing would quickly be give u provide we perfectly prepare ourselves for it at once a some of the saint have donewe think we be give all to god but in fact we be offer only the revenue or the produce while we retain the feesimple of the land in our own possession we resolve to become poor and it be a resolution of great merit but we very often take great care notto be in want notsimply of what be necessary but of what be superfluous yea and to make for ourselves friend who may supply u and in this way we take more pain and perhaps expose ourselves to great danger in order that we may want nothing than we do formerly when we have our own possession in our own power we think also that we give up all desire of honour when we become religious or when we begin the spiritual life and follow after perfection and yet when we be touch on the point of honour we do notthen remember that we have give it up to godwe would seize it again and take it a they say out of hi hand even after we have make him to all appearance the lord of our own willso be it in every thing els a pleasant way this of seek the love of god we retain our own affection and yet will have that love a they say by handfulswe make no effort to bring our desire to good effect or to raise them resolutely above the earth and yet with all this we must have many spiritual consolationsthis be notwell and we be seek thing that be incompatible one with the otherso because we do notgive ourselves up wholly and at once this treasure be notgive wholly and at once to usmay it be the good pleasure of our lord to give it u drop by drop though it may cost u all the trial in the world he showeth great mercy unto him to whom he give the grace and resolution to strive for this blessing with all hi might for god withhold himself from no one who persevereshe will by little and little strengthen that soul so that it may come forth victoriousi say resolution because of the multitude of those thing which satan put before it at first to keep it back from begin to travel on this road for he knoweth what harm will befall him therebyhe will lose notonly that soul but many other alsoif he who enter on this road do violence to himself with the help of god so a to reach the summit of perfection such a one i believe will never go alone to heaven he will always take many with him god give to him a to a good captain those who shall be of hi company thus then the danger and difficulty which satan put before them be so many that they have need notof a little but of a very great resolution and great grace from god to save them from fall away speak then of their beginning who be determine to follow after this good and to succeed in their enterprisewhat i begin to say of mystical theologyi believe they call it by that namei shall proceed with hereafteri have to say that the labour be great at first for it be they who toil our lord indeed give them strengthin the other degree of prayer there be more of fruition although they who be in the begin the middle and the end have their cross to carry the cross however be differentthey who would follow christ if they do notwish to be lose must walk in the way he walk himselfblessed labour even here in this life so superabundantly reward i shall have to make use of a comparison i should like to avoid it because i be a woman and write simply what i have be commandedbut this language of spirituality be so difficult of utterance for those who be notlearn and such be ii have therefore to seek for some mean to make the matter plainit may be that the comparison will very rarely be to the purposeyour reverence will be amuse when you see my stupidityi think now i have either read or heard of this comparison but a my memory be bad i know notwhere nor on what occasion however i be satisfied with it for my present purpose a beginner must look upon himself a make a garden wherein our lord may take hi delight but in a soil unfruitful and abound in weedshis majesty root up the weed and have to plant good herbslet u then take for grant that this be already do when a soul be determine to give itself to prayer and have begin the practice of itwe have then as good gardener by the help of god to see that the plant grow to water them carefully that they may notdie but produce blossom which shall send forth much fragrance refresh to our lord so that he may come often for hi pleasure into this garden and delight himself in the midst of these virtue let u now see how this garden be to be water that we may understand what we have to do how much trouble it will cost u whether the gain be great than the trouble or how long a time it will take usit seem to me that the garden may be water in four way by water take out of a well which be very laborious or with water raise by mean of an engine and bucket draw by a windlassi have draw it this way sometimesit be a less troublesome way than the first and give more water or by a stream or brook whereby the garden be water in a much well wayfor the soil be more thoroughly saturate and there be no necessity to water it so often and the labour of the gardener be much less or by shower of rain when our lord himself water it without labour on our partand this way be incomparably good than all the other of which i have speak now then for the application of these four way of irrigation by which the garden be to be maintain for without water it must failthe comparison be to my purpose and it seem to me that by the help of it i shall be able to explain in some measure the four degree of prayer to which our lord of hi goodness have occasionally raise my soulmay he graciously grant that i may so speak a to be of some service to one of those who have command me to write whom our lord have raise in four month to a great height than i have reach in seventeen year he prepare himself good than i do and therefore be hi garden without labour on hi part irrigate by these four watersthough the last of them be only drop by drop but it be grow in such a way that soon by the help of our lord he will be swallow up therein and it will be a pleasure to me if he find my explanation absurd that he should laugh at it of those who be beginner in prayer we may say that they be those who draw the water up out of the wella process which a i have say be very laborious for they must be weary in keep the sens recollect and this be a great labour because the sens have be hitherto accustom to distractionsit be necessary for beginner to accustom themselves to disregard what they hear or see and to put it away from them during the time of prayer they must be alone and in retirement think over their past lifethough all must do this many time beginner as well a those more advanced all however must notdo so equally a i shall show hereafter beginner at first suffer much because they be notconvince that they be penitent for their sin and yet they be because they be so sincerely resolve on serve godthey must strive to meditate on the life of christ and the understanding be weary therebythus far we can advance of ourselvesthat be by the grace of godfor without that a every one know we never can have one good thought this be begin to draw water up out of the wellgod grant there may be water in it that however do notdepend on u we be draw it and do what we can towards water the flowersso good be god that when for reason know to hi majestyperhaps for our great goodit be hi will the well should be dry he himself preserve the flower without waterwe like good gardener do what lie in our powerand make our virtue growby water here i mean tear and if there be none then tenderness and an inward feeling of devotion what then will he do here who see that for many day he be conscious only of aridity disgust dislike and so great an unwillingness to go to the well for water that he would give it up altogether if he do notremember that he have to please and serve the lord of the garden if he do nottrust that hi service be notin vain and do nothope for some gain by a labour so great a that of lower the bucket into the well so often and draw it up without water in it it will happen that he be often unable to move hi arm for that purpose or to have one good thought work with the understanding be draw water out of the well what then once more will the gardener do now he must rejoice and take comfort and consider it a the great favour to labour in the garden of so great an emperor and a he know that he be please him in the matterand hi purpose must notbe to please himself but himlet him praise him greatly for the trust he have in himfor he see that without any recompense he be take so much care of that which have be confide to him let him help him to carry the cross and let him think how he carry it all hi life long let him notseek hi kingdom here nor ever intermit hi prayer and so let him resolve if this aridity should last even hi whole life long never to let christ fall down beneath the cross the time will come when he shall be pay once for alllet him have no fear that hi labour be in vain he serve a good master whose eye be upon himlet him make no account of evil thought but remember that satan suggest them to stjerome also in the desert these labour have their reward i know it for i be one who undergo them for many yearswhen i draw but one drop of water out of this bless well i consider it be a mercy of godi know these labour be very great and require i think great courage than many other in this world but i have see clearly that god do notleave them without a great recompense even in this life for it be very certain that in one hour during which our lord give me to taste hi sweetness all the anxiety which i have to bear when persevere in prayer seem to me ever afterwards perfectly reward i believe that it be our lord good pleasure frequently in the beginning and at time in the end to send these torment and many other incidental temptation to try those who love him and to ascertain if they will drink the chalice and help him to carry the cross before he intrust them with hi great treasuresi believe it to be for our good that hi majesty should lead u by this way so that we may perfectly understand how worthless we be for the grace which he give afterwards be of a dignity so great that he will have u by experience know our wretchedness before he grant them that it may notbe with u a it be with lucifer what canst thou do o my lord that be notfor the great good of that soul which thou knowest to be already thine and which give itself up to thee to follow thee whithersoever thou go even to the death of the cross and which be determine to help thee to carry that cross and notto leave thee alone with it he who shall discern this resolution in himself have nothing to fear no no spiritual people have nothing to fearthere be no reason why he should be distress who be already raise to so high a degree a this be of wish to converse in solitude with god and to abandon the amusement of the worldthe great part of the work be do give praise to hi majesty for it and trust in hi goodness who have never fail those who love himclose the eye of your imagination and do notask why he give devotion to this person in so short a time and none to me after so many yearslet u believe that all be for our great good let hi majesty guide u whithersoever he will we be notour own but hishe show u mercy enough when it be hi pleasure we should be willing to dig in hi garden and to be so near the lord of it he certainly be near to usif it be hi will that these plant and flower should growsome of them when he give water we may draw from the well other when he give nonewhat be that to me do thou o lord accomplish thy will let me never offend thee nor let my virtue perish if thou hast give me any it be out of thy mere goodnessi wish to suffer because thou o lord hast suffer do thou in every way fulfil thy will in me and may it never be the pleasure of thy majesty that a gift of so high a price a that of thy love be give to people who serve thee only because of the sweetness they find thereby it be much to be observe and i say so because i know by experience that the soul which begin to walk in the way of mental prayer with resolution and be determine notto care much neither to rejoice nor to be greatly afflicted whether sweetness and tenderness fail it or our lord grant them have already travel a great part of the roadlet that soul then have no fear that it be go back though it may frequently stumble for the building be begin on a firm foundationit be certain that the love of god do notconsist in tear nor in this sweetness and tenderness which we for the most part desire and with which we console ourselves but rather in serve him in justice fortitude and humilitythat seem to me to be a receive rather than a give of anything on our part a for poor woman such a i be weak and infirm of purpose it seem to me to be necessary that i should be lead on through consolation a god be do now so that i might be able to endure certain affliction which it have please hi majesty i should havebut when the servant of god who be men of weight learning and sense make so much account a i see they do whether god give them sweetness in devotion or noti be disgust when i listen to themi do notsay that they ought notto accept it and make much of it when god give itbecause when he give it hi majesty see it to be necessary for thembut i do say that they ought notto grow weary when they have it notthey should then understand that they have no need of it and be master of themselves when hi majesty do notgive itlet them be convince of this there be a fault here i have have experience of it and know it to be solet them believe it a an imperfection they be notadvance in liberty of spirit but shrink like coward from the assault it be notso much to beginner that i say thisthough i do insist upon it because it be of great importance to them that they should begin with this liberty and resolutionas to other of whom there be many who make a beginning but never come to the end and that be owe i believe in great measure to their nothave embrace the cross from the firstthey be distress think they be do nothing the understanding cease from it act and they can notbear ityet perhaps at that very time the will be feed and gather strength and they know it notwe must suppose that our lord do notregard these thing for though they seem to u to be fault yet they be nothis majesty knoweth our misery and natural vileness well than we do ourselveshe knoweth that these soul long to be always think of him and love himit be this resolution that he seek in u the other anxiety which we inflict upon ourselves serve to no other end but to disquiet the soulwhich if it be unable to derive any profit in one hour will by them be disable for fourthis come most frequently from bodily indispositioni have have very great experience in the matter and i know it be true for i have carefully observe it and discuss it afterwards with spiritual personsfor we be so wretched that this poor prisoner of a soul share in the misery of the bodythe change of the season and the alteration of the humour very often compel it without fault of it own notto do what it would but rather to suffer in every waymeanwhile the more we force the soul on these occasion the great the mischief and the long it lastssome discretion must be use in order to ascertain whether illhealth be the occasion or notthe poor soul must notbe stifledlet those who thus suffer understand that they be ill a change should be make in the hour of prayer and oftentimes that change should be continue for some dayslet souls pas out of this desert a they can for it be very often the misery of one that love god to see itself live in such wretchedness unable to do what it would because it have to keep so evil a guest a the body i speak of discretion because sometimes the devil will do the same work and so it be notalways right to omit prayer when the understanding be greatly distract and disturb nor to torment the soul to the do of that which be out of it powerthere be other thing then to be doneexterior work a of charity and spiritual readingthough at time the soul will notbe able to do themtake care then of the body for the love of god because at many other time the body must serve the soul and let recourse be have to some recreationsholy onessuch a conversation or go out into the field a the confessor shall advisealtogether experience be a great matter and it make u understand what be convenient for uslet god be serve in all thingshis yoke be sweet and it be of great importance that the soul should notbe drag a they say but carry gently that it may make great progress so then i come back to what i advise before and though i repeat it often it matter notit be of great importance that no one should distress himself on account of aridity or because hi thought be restless and distract neither should he be afflict thereat if he would attain to liberty of spirit and notbe always in troublelet him begin by notbe afraid of the cross and he will see how our lord will help him to carry it how joyfully he will advance and what profit he will derive from it allit be now clear if there be no water in the well that we at least can put none into itit be true we must notbe careless about draw it when there be any in it because at that time it be the will of god to multiply our virtue by mean thereof what we can ourselves dothe evil of desire to attain to supernatural state before our lord call u my aim in the foregoing chapterthough i digress to many other matter because they seem to me very necessarywas to explain how much we may attain to of ourselves and how in these beginning of devotion we be able in some degree to help ourselves because thinking of and ponder on the suffering of our lord for our sake move u to compassion and the sorrow and tear which result therefrom be sweetthe thought of the blessedness we hope for of the love our lord bore u and of hi resurrection kindle within u a joy which be neither wholly spiritual nor wholly sensual but the joy be virtuous and the sorrow be most meritorious of this kind be all those thing which produce a devotion acquire in part by mean of the understanding though it can neither be merit nor have if god grant it notit be best for a soul which god have notraise to a high state than this notto try to rise of itselflet this be well consider because all the soul will gain in that way will be a lossin this state it can make many act of good resolution to do much for god and enkindle it love other act also which may help the growth of virtue accord to that which be write in a book call the art of serving god a most excellent work and profitable for those who be in this state because the understanding be active now the soul may also place itself in the presence of christ and accustom itself to many act of love direct to hi sacred humanity and remain in hi presence continually and speak to him pray to him in it necessity and complain to him of it trouble be merry with him in it joy and yet notforget him because of it joysall this it may do without set prayer but rather with word befit it desire and it need this be an excellent way whereby to advance and that very quicklyhe that will strive to have this precious companionship and will make much of it and will sincerely love our lord to whom we owe so much be one in my opinion who have make some progressthere be therefore no reason why we should trouble ourselves because we have no sensible devotion a i say before but let u rather give thanks to our lord who allow u to have a desire to please him though our work be poorthis practice of the presence of christ be profitable in all state of prayer and be a most safe way of advance in the first state and of attain quickly to the second and a for the last state it secure u against those risk which the devil may occasion this then be what we can dohe who would pass out of this state and upraise hi spirit in order to taste consolation deny him will in my opinion lose both the one and the other these consolation be supernatural and the understanding inactive the soul be then left desolate and in great aridityas the foundation of the whole building be humility the nearer we draw unto god the more this virtue should grow if it do noteverything be lostit seem to be a kind of pride when we seek to ascend high see that god descend so low when he allow u be what we be to draw near unto him it must notbe suppose that i be now speak of raise our thought to the consideration of the high thing of heaven and of it glory or unto god and hi great wisdomi never do this myself because i have notthe capacity for itas i say before and i be so worthless that a to think even of the thing of earth god give me grace to understand this truth that in me it be no slight boldness to do sohow much more then the thinking of heavenly thing other however will profit in that way particularly those who be learn for learn in my opinion be a great treasury in the matter of this exercise if it be accompany with humilityi observe this a few day ago in some learn men who have shortly before make a beginning and have make great progressthis be the reason why i be so very anxious that many learn men may become spirituali shall speak of this by and by what i be sayingnamely let them notrise if god do notraise themis the language of spiritualityhe will understand me who have have any experience and i know nothow to explain it if what i have say do notmake it plain in mystical theologyof which i speak before the understanding cease from it act because god suspend itas i shall explain by and by if i can and god give me the grace to do sow must neither imagine nor think that we can of ourselves bring about this suspensionthat be what i say must notbe do nor must we allow the understanding to cease from it act for in that case we shall be stupid and cold and the result will be neither the one nor the otherfor when our lord suspend the understanding and make it cease from it act he put before it that which astonishes and occupies it so that without make any reflection it shall comprehend in a moment more than we could comprehend in many year with all the effort in the world to have the power of the mind occupy and to think that you can keep them at the same time quiet be follyi repeat it though it be notso understood there be no great humility in this and if it be blameless it be notleft unpunishedit be labour thrown away and the soul be a little disgusted it feel like a man about to take a leap and be hold backsuch a one seem to have use up hi strength already and find himself unable to do that which he wish to have do so here in the scanty gain that remain he who will consider the matter will trace that slight want of humility of which i have speak for that virtue have this excellence there be no good work attend by humility that leave the soul disgustedit seem to me that i have make this clear enough yet after all perhaps only for myselfmay our lord open their eye who read this by give them experience and then however slight that experience may be they will immediately understand it for many year i read much and understood nothing and for a long time too though god give me understanding herein i never could utter a word by which i might explain it to othersthis be no little trouble to mewhen hi majesty please he teach everything in a moment so that i be lose in wonderone thing i can truly say though i converse with many spiritual person who seek to make me understand what our lord be give me in order that i might be able to speak of it the fact be that my dulness be so great that i derive no advantage whatever much or little from their teaching or it may be a hi majesty have always be my mastermay he be bless for ever for i be ashamed of myself that i can say so with truththat it be hi good pleasure i should meet with no one to whom i should be indebted in this matterso without my wishing or ask iti never be careful about this for that would have be a virtue in me but only about vanitygod give me to understand with all distinctness in a moment and also enable me to express myself so that my confessor be astonish but i more than they because i know my own dulness betterit be notlong since this happenedand so that which our lord have notteach me i seek notto know it unless it be a matter that touch my conscience again i repeat my advice it be of great moment notto raise our spirit ourselves if our lord do notraise it for u and if he do there can be no mistake itfor woman it be specially wrong because the devil can delude themthough i be certain our lord will never allow him to hurt any one who labour to draw near unto god in humilityon the contrary such a one will derive more profit and advantage out of that attack by which satan intend to hurt him i have dwell so long upon this matter because this way of prayer be the most common with beginner and because the advice i have give be very importantit will be find much well give elsewhere that i admit and i admit also that in write it i be ashamed of myself and cover with confusionthough notso much so a i ought to beblessed for ever be our lord of whose will and pleasure it be that i be allow be what i be to speak of thing which be hi of such a nature and so deep of certain temptation of sataninstructions relating thereto i have think it right to speak of certain temptation i have observe to which beginner be liablesome of them i have have myselfand to give some advice about certain thing which to me seem necessaryin the beginning then we should strive to be cheerful and unconstrained for there be people who think it be all over with devotion if they relax themselves ever so littleit be right to be afraid of self so that have no confidence in ourselves much or little we may notplace ourselves in those circumstance wherein men usually sin against god for it be a most necessary fear till we become very perfect in virtueand there be notmany who be so perfect a to be able to relax themselves on those occasion which offer temptation to their natural temper for always while we live be it only to preserve humility it be well we should know our own miserable nature but there be many occasion on which it be permitted usas i say just now to take some recreation in order that we may with more vigour resume our prayer discretion be necessary throughoutwe must have great confidence because it be very necessary for u notto contract our desire but put our trust in god for if we do violence to ourselves by little and little we shall though notat once reach that height which many saint by hi grace have reachedif they have never resolve to desire and have never by little and little acted upon that resolve they never could have ascend to so high a state hi majesty seek and love courageous soul but they must be humble in their way and have no confidence in themselvesi never saw one of those lag behind on the road and never a cowardly soul though aid by humility make that progress in many year which the former make in a fewi be astonish at the great thing do on this road by encourage oneself to undertake great thing though we may nothave the strength for them at once the soul take a flight upwards and ascends high though like a little bird whose wing be weak it grow weary and rest at one time i use often to think of those word of stpaul that all thing be possible in god i saw clearly that of myself i could do nothingthis be of great service to meso also be the saying of staugustine give me o lord what thou commandest and command what thou wilt i be often think how stpeter lose nothing by throw himself into the sea though he be afterwards afraid these first resolution be a great matteralthough it be necessary in the beginning that we should be very reserve control by the discretion and authority of a director but we must take care that he be one who do notteach u to crawl like toad nor one who may be satisfy when the soul show itself fit only to catch lizardshumility must always go before so that we may know that this strength can come out of no strength of our own but it be necessary we should understand what manner of humility this should be because satan i believe do great harm for he hinder those who begin to pray from go onwards by suggest to them false notion of humilityhe make them think it be pride to have large desire to wish to imitate the saint and to long for martyrdomhe tell u forthwith or he make u think that the action of the saint be to be admire notto be imitate by u who be sinnersi too say the same thing but we must see what those action be which we be to admire and what those be which we be to imitate for it would be wrong in a person who be weak and sickly to undertake much fasting and sharp penance to retire into the desert where he could notsleep nor find anything to eat or indeed to undertake any austerity of this kind but we ought to think that we can force ourselves by the grace of god to hold the world in profound contemptto make light of honour and be detach from our possessionsour heart however be so mean that we think the earth would fail u under our foot if we be to cease to care even for a moment for the body and give ourselves up to spiritualitythen we think that to have all we require contributes to recollection because anxiety disturb prayerit be painful to me that our confidence in god be so scanty and our selflove so strong a that any anxiety about our own necessity should disturb usbut so it be for when our spiritual progress be so slight a mere nothing will give u a much trouble a great and important matter will give to othersand we think ourselves spiritual now to me this way of go on seem to betray a disposition to reconcile soul and body together in order that we may notmiss our ease in this world and yet have the fruition of god in the next and so it will be if we walk accord to justice cling to virtue but it be the pace of a henit will never bring u to liberty of spiritit be a course of proceed a it seem to me most excellent for those who be in the married state and who must live accord to their vocation but for the other state i by no mean wish for such a method of progress neither can i be make to believe it to be sound for i have try it and i should have remain in that way if our lord in hi goodness have notteach me another and a short road though in the matter of desire i always have generous one but i labour a i say before to make my prayer and at the same time to live at my easeif there have be any one to rouse me to a high flight he might have bring me so i think to a state in which these desire might have have their effect but for our sin so few and so rare be they whose discretion in that matter be notexcessivethat i believe be reason enough why those who begin do notattain more quickly to great perfection for our lord never fail u and it be nothi fault the fault and the wretchedness of this be all our own we may also imitate the saint by strive after solitude and silence and many other virtue that will notkill these wretched body of ours which insist on be treat so orderly that they may disorder the soul and satan too help much to make them unmanageablewhen he see u a little anxious about them he want nothing more to convince u that our way of life must kill u and destroy our health even if we weep he make u afraid of blindnessi have pass through this and therefore i know it but i know of no good sight or good health that we can desire than the loss of both in such a causebeing myself so sickly i be always under constraint and good for nothing till i resolve to make no account of my body nor of my health even now i be worthless enough but when it please god to let me find out this device of satan i use to say to the latter when he suggest to me that i be ruin my health that my death be of no consequence when he suggest rest i reply that i do notwant rest but the crosshis other suggestion i treat in the same wayi saw clearly that in most thing though i be really very sickly it be either a temptation of satan or a weakness on my partmy health have be much well since i have cease to look after my ease and comfortsit be of great importance notto let our own thought frighten u in the beginning when we set ourselves to praybelieve me in this for i know it by experienceas a warning to other it may be that this story of my failure may be useful there be another temptation which be very common when people begin to have pleasure in the rest and the fruit of prayer they will have everybody els be very spiritual alsonow to desire this be notwrong but to try to bring it about may notbe right except with great discretion and with much reserve without any appearance of teachinghe who would do any good in this matter ought to be endow with solid virtue that he may notput temptation in the way of othersit happen to methat be how i know itwhen a i say before i make other apply themselves to prayer to be a source of temptation and disorder for on the one hand they hear me say great thing of the blessedness of prayer and on the other saw how poor i be in virtue notwithstanding my prayerthey have good reason on their side and afterwards they tell me of it for they know nothow these thing could be compatible one with the otherthis it be that make them notto regard that a evil which be really so in itself namely that they saw me do it myself now and then during the time that they think well of me in some measure this be satan work he seem to take advantage of the virtue we may have for the purpose of give a sanction so far a he can to the evil he aim at how slight soever that evil may be hi gain must be great if it prevail in a religious househow much then must hi gain have be when the evil i do be so very great and thus during many year only three person be the good for what i say to them but now that our lord have make me strong in virtue in the course of two or three year many person have profit a i shall show hereafter there be another great inconvenience in addition to this the loss to our own soul for the utmost we have to do in the beginning be to take care of our own soul only and consider that in the whole world there be only god and our soulthis be a point of great importance there be another temptationwe ought to be aware of it and be cautious in our conduct person be carry away by a zeal for virtue through the pain which the sight of the sin and failing of other occasion themsatan tell them that this pain arise only out of their desire that god may notbe offend and out of their anxiety about hi honour so they immediately seek to remedy the evilthis so disturb them that they can notpraythe great evil of all be their thinking this an act of virtue of perfection and of a great zeal for godi be notspeak of the pain which public sin occasion if they be habitual in any community nor of wrong do to the church nor of heresy by which so many soul be visibly lose for this pain be most wholesome and be wholesome be no source of disquietthe security therefore of that soul which would apply itself to prayer lie in cast away from itself all anxiety about person and thing in take care of itself and in please godthis be the most profitable course if i be to speak of the mistake which i have see people make in reliance on their own good intention i should never come to an endlet u labour therefore always to consider the virtue and the good quality which we discern in other and with our own great sin cover our eye so that we may see none of their failingsthis be one way of do our work and though we may notbe perfect in it at once we shall acquire one great virtuewe shall look upon all men a good than ourselves and we begin to acquire that virtue in this way by the grace of god which be necessary in all thingsfor when we have it notall our endeavour be in vainand by implore him to give u this virtue for he never fail u if we do what we can this advice also they must take into their consideration who make much use of their understanding eliciting from one subject many thought and conceptionsas to those who like myself can notdo it i have no advice to give except that they be to have patience until our lord shall send them both matter and light for they can do so little of themselves that their understanding be a hindrance to them rather than a help to those then who can make use of their understanding i say that they be notto spend the whole time in that way for though it be most meritorious yet they must notwhen prayer be sweet suppose that there never will be a sunday or a time when no work ought to be donethey think it lose time to do otherwise but i think that loss their great gainlet them rather a i have say place themselves in the presence of christ and without fatigue the understanding converse with him and in him rejoice without weary themselves in search out reason but let them rather lay their necessity before him and the just reason there be why he should notsuffer u in hi presence at one time this at another time that l the soul should be weary by always eat of the same foodthese meat be most savoury and wholesome if the palate be accustom to them they will furnish a great support for the life of the soul and they have many other advantage also i will explain myself far for the doctrine of prayer be difficult and without a director very hard to understandthough i would willingly be concise and though a mere hint be enough for hi clear intellect who have command me to write on the subject of prayer yet so it be my dulness do notallow me to say or explain in a few word that which it be so important to explain welli who have go through so much be sorry for those who begin only with book for there be a strange difference between that which we learn by read and that which we learn by experience going back then to what i be sayingwe set ourselves to meditate upon some mystery of the passion let u say our lord at the pillarthe understanding goeth about seek for the source out of which come the great dolour and the bitter anguish which hi majesty endure in that desolationit consider that mystery in many light which the intellect if it be skilled in it work or furnish with learning may there obtainthis be a method of prayer which should be to everyone the begin the middle and the end a most excellent and safe way until our lord shall guide them to other supernatural way i say to all because there be many soul who make great progress by meditation on other subject than on the sacred passion for a there be many mansion in heaven so there be also many road lead thithersome person advance by consider themselves in hell other in heavenand these be distress by meditation on hellothers meditate on death some person if tenderhearted be greatly fatigue by continual meditation on the passion but be console and make progress when they meditate on the power and greatness of god in hi creature and on hi love visible in all thingsthis be an admirable methodnot omit however from time to time the passion and life of christ the source of all good that ever come and that ever shall come he who begin be in need of instruction whereby he may ascertain what profit him mostfor this end it be very necessary he should have a director who ought to be a person of experience for if he be nothe will make many mistake and direct a soul without understand it way or suffer it to understand them itself for such a soul knowing that obedience to a director be highly meritorious dare nottransgress the commandment it receivesi have meet with soul cramp and torment because he who direct them have no experience that make me sorry for themsome of them know notwhat to do with themselves for director who do notunderstand the spirit of their penitent afflict them soul and body and hinder their progress one person i have to do with have be keep by her director for eight year a it be in prison he would notallow her to quit the subject of selfknowledge and yet our lord have already raise her to the prayer of quiet so she have much to suffer although this matter of selfknowledge must never be put asidefor there be no soul so great a giant on this road but have frequent need to turn back and be again an infant at the breast and this must never be forgotteni shall repeat it perhaps many time because of it great importancefor among all the state of prayer however high they may be there be notone in which it be notoften necessary to go back to the beginningthe knowledge of our sin and of our own self be the bread which we have to eat with all the meat however delicate they may be in the way of prayer without this bread life can notbe sustain though it must be take by measurewhen a soul behold itself resign and clearly understand that there be no goodness in itwhen it feel itself abash in the presence of so great a king and see how little it pay of the great debt it owe himwhy should it be necessary for it to waste it time on this subject why should it notrather proceed to other matter which our lord place before it and for neglect which there be no reason hi majesty surely know good than we do what kind of food be proper for u so then it be of great consequence that the director should be prudenti mean of sound understandingand a man of experienceif in addition to this he be a learned man it be a very great matterbut if these three quality can notbe have together the first two be the most important because learn men may be find with whom we can communicate when it be necessaryi mean that for beginner learn men be of little use if they be notmen of prayeri do notsay that they be to have nothing to do with learn men because a spirituality the foundation of which be notrest on the truth i would rather be notaccompany with prayerlearning be a great thing for it teach u who know so little and enlighten u so when we have come to the knowledge of the truth contain in the holy writing we do what we ought to dofrom silly devotion god deliver u i will explain myself far for i be meddle i believe with too many mattersit have always be my fail that i could never make myself understoodas i say before but at the cost of many wordsa nun begin to practise prayer if her director be silly and if he should take it into hi head he will make her feel that it be well for her to obey him than her own superiorhe will do all this without any evil purpose thinking that he be do rightfor if he be nota religious himself he will think this right enoughif hi penitent be a married woman he will tell her that it be well for her to give herself unto prayer when she ought to attend to her house although she may thereby displease her husbandand so it be he know nothow to make arrangement for time and business so that everything may be do a it ought to be do he have no light himself and can therefore give none to other however much he may wish to do so though learning do notseem necessary for discretion my opinion have always be and will be that every christian should continue to be guide by a learned director if he can and the more learn the betterthey who walk in the way of prayer have the great need of learn and the more spiritual they be the great be that needlet them notsay that learned men notgive to prayer be notfit counsellor for those who pray that be a delusioni have converse with many and now for some year i have seek them the more because of my great need of themi have always be fond of them for though some of them have no experience they do notdislike spirituality neither be they ignorant of what it be because in the sacred writing with which they be familiar they always find the truth about spiritualityi be certain myself that a person give to prayer who treat of these matter with learn men unless he be deceive with hi own consent will never be carry away by any illusion of the devili believe that the evil spirit be exceedingly afraid of learn men who be humble and virtuous know that they will be find out and defeat by them i have say this because there be opinion hold to the effect that learn men if they be notspiritual be notsuit for person give to prayeri have just say that a spiritual director be necessary but if he be nota learned man he be a great hindranceit will help u much if we consult those who be learn provide they be virtuous even if they be notspiritual they will be of service to me and god will enable them to understand what they should teach he will even make them spiritual in order that they may help u oni do notsay this without have have experience of it and i have meet with more than two i say then that a person who shall resign hi soul to be wholly subject to one director will make a great mistake if he be in religion unless he find a director of this kind because of the obedience due to hi own superiorhis director may be deficient in the three requisite i speak of and that will be no slight cross without voluntarily subject the understanding to one whose understanding be none of the bestat least i have never be able to bring myself to do it neither do it seem to me to be right but if he be a person living in the world let him praise god for the power he have of choose whom he will obey and let him notlose so excellent a liberty yea rather let him be without a director till he find himfor our lord will give him one if he be really humble and have a desire to meet with the right personi praise god greatlywe woman and those who be unlearned ought always to render him unceasing thanksbecause there be person who by labour so great have attain to the truth of which we unlearn people be ignoranti often wonder at learn menparticularly those who be in religionwhen i think of the trouble they have have in acquire that which they communicate to me for my good and that without any more trouble to me than the ask for itand yet there be people who will nottake advantage of their learning god grant it may notbe so i see them undergo the poverty of the religious life which be great together with it penance it meagre food the yoke of obedience which make me ashamed of myself at time and with all this interrupted sleep trial everywhere everywhere the crossi think it would be a great evil for any one to lose so great a good by hi own faultit may be some of u who be exempt from these burdenswho have our food put into our mouth a they say and live at our easemay think because we give ourselves a little more to prayer that we be raise above the necessity of such great hardshipsblessed be thou o lord who hast make me so incapable and so useless but i bless thee still more for thisthat thou quickenest so many to quicken usour prayer must therefore be very earnest for those who give u lightwhat should we be without them in the midst of these violent storm which now disturb the church if some have fall the good will shine more and more may it please our lord to hold them in hi hand and help them that they may help u i have go far away from the subject i begin to speak of but all be to the purpose for those who be beginner that they may begin a journey which be so high in such a way a that they shall go on by the right roadcoming back then to what i speak of before the meditation on christ bound to the pillar it be well we should make reflection for a time and consider the suffering he there endure for whom he endure them who he be who endure them and the love with which he bore thembut a person should notalways fatigue himself in make these reflection but rather let him remain there with christ in the silence of the understanding if he be able let him employ himself in look upon christ who be look upon him let him accompany him and make hi petition to him let him humble himself and delight himself in christ and keep in mind that he never deserve to be therewhen he shall be able to do this though it may be in the beginning of hi prayer he will find great advantage and this way of prayer bring great advantage with itat least so my soul have find iti do notknow whether i be describe it aright you my father will see to itmay our lord grant me to please him rightly for ever amen the second state of prayerits supernatural character having spoken of the toilsome effort and of the strength require for water the garden when we have to draw the water out of the well let u now speak of the second manner of draw the water which the lord of the vineyard have ordain of the machine of wheel and bucket whereby the gardener may draw more water with less labour and be able to take some rest without be continually at workthis then be what i be now go to describe and i apply it to the prayer call the prayer of quiet herein the soul begin to be recollect it be now touch on the supernaturalfor it never could by any effort of it own attain to thistrue it seem at time to have be weary at the wheel labour with the understanding and fill the bucket but in this second degree the water be high and accordingly the labour be much less than it be when the water have to be draw up out of the well i mean that the water be near to it for grace reveals itself more distinctly to the soul this be a gather together of the faculty of the soul within itself in order that it may have the fruition of that contentment in great sweetness but the faculty be notlose neither be they asleep the will alone be occupy in such a way that without know how it have become a captive it give a simple consent to become the prisoner of god for it know well what be to be the captive of him it loveso my jesus and my lord how pressing now be thy love it bind our love in bond so straitly that it be notin it power at this moment to love anything els but thee the other two faculty help the will that it may render itself capable of the fruition of so great a good nevertheless it occasionally happen even when the will be in union that they hinder it very much but then it should never heed them at all simply abide in it fruition and quiet for if it try to make them recollect it would miss it way together with them because they be at this time like dove which be notsatisfy with the food the master of the dovecot give them without any labouring for it on their part and which go forth in quest of it elsewhere and so hardly find it that they come backand so the memory and the understanding come and go seek whether the will be go to give them that into the fruition ofwhich it have enter itself if it be our lord pleasure to throw them any food they stop if notthey go again to seek itthey must be think that they be of some service to the will and now and then the memory or the imagination seek to represent to it that of which it have the fruition do it harmthe will therefore should be careful to deal with them a i shall explaineverything that take place now in this state bring the very great consolation and the labour be so slight that prayer even if persevere in for some time be never wearisomethe reason be that the understanding be now work very gently and be draw very much more water than it draw out of the wellthe tear which god now send flow with joy though we feel them they be notthe result of any effort of our own this water of grand blessing and grace which our lord now supply make the virtue thrive much more beyond all comparison than they do in the previous state of prayer for the soul be already ascend out of it wretched state and some little knowledge of the blissfulness of glory be communicate to itthis i believe be it that make the virtue grow the more and also to draw nearer to essential virtue god himself from whom all virtue proceed for hi majesty have begin to communicate himself to this soul and will have it feel how he be communicate himself a soon a the soul have arrive thus far it begin to lose the desire of earthly thing and no wonder for it see clearly that even for a moment this joy be notto be have on earth that there be no rich no dominion no honour no delight that can for one instant even for the twinkling of an eye minister such a joy for it be a true satisfaction and the soul see that it really do satisfynow we who be on earth a it seem to me scarcely ever understand wherein our satisfaction lie for it be always liable to disappointment but in this at that time there be none the disappointment cometh afterwards when the soul see that all be over and that it have no power to recover it neither do it know how for if it cut itself in piece by penance and prayer and every other kind of austerity all would be of little use if our lord do notgrant itgod in hi great mercy will have the soul comprehend that hi majesty be so near to it that it need notsend messenger to him but may speak to him itself and notwith a loud cry because so near be he already that he understand even the movement of it lip it seem absurd to say this see that we know that god understand u always and be present with usit be so and there can be no doubt of it but our emperor and lord will have u now understand that he understand u and also have u understand what hi presence bringeth about and that he mean in a special way to begin a work in the soul which be manifest in the great joy inward and outward which he communicate and in the difference there be a i say just now between this joy and delight and all the joy of earth for he seem to be fill up the void in our soul occasion by our sin this satisfaction lie in the innermost part of the soul and the soul know notwhence nor how it come very often it know notwhat to do or wish or pray forit seem to find all this at once and knoweth notwhat it hath find nor do i know how to explain it because learn be necessary for many thingshere indeed learn would be very much to the purpose in order to explain the general and particular help of grace for there be many who know nothing about themlearning would serve to show how our lord now will have the soul to see a it be with the naked eye a men speak this particular help of grace and be also useful in many other way wherein i be likely to go astraybut a what i write be to be see by those who have the learning to discover whether i make mistake or noti go on without anxiety for i know i need have none whatever about either the letter or the spirit because it be in their power to whom it be to be send to do with it a they will they will understand it and blot out whatever may be amiss i should like them to explain this because it be a principal point and because a soul when our lord begin to bestow these grace upon it do notunderstand them and do notknow what to do with itself for if god lead it by the way of fear a he lead me it trial will be heavy if there be no one who understand the state it be in and to see itself a in a picture be a great comfort and then it see clearly that it be travel on that roadthe knowledge of what it have to do be a great blessing for it so that it may advance forward in every one of these degree of prayer for i have suffer greatly and lost much time because i do notknow what to do and i be very sorry for those soul who find themselves alone when they come to this state for though i read many spiritual book wherein this very matter be discuss they throw very little light upon itand if it be nota soul much exercise in prayer it will find it enough to understand it state be the book ever so clear i wish much that our lord would help me to describe the effect on the soul of these thing now that they begin to be supernatural so that men might know by these effect whether they come from the spirit of godi mean know a thing be know here belowthough it be always well to live in fear and on our guard for even if they do come from god now and then the devil will be able to transform himself into an angel of light and the soul if notexperience herein will notunderstand the matter and it must have so much experience for the understanding thereof that it be necessary it should have attain to the high perfection of prayer the little time i have help me but little and it be therefore necessary hi majesty should undertake it himself for i have to live in community and have very many thing to employ me a i be in a house which be newly foundedas will appear hereafter and so i be write with very many interruption by little and little at a timei wish i have leisure for when our lord give the spirit it be more easily and good do it be then a with a person work embroidery with the pattern before her but if the spirit be want there be no more meaning in the word than in gibberish so to speak though many year may have be spend in prayerand thus i think it a very great advantage to be in this state of prayer when i be write this for i see clearly that it be noti who speak nor be it i who with her understanding have arrange it and afterwards i do notknow how i come to speak so accurately it have often happen to me thus let u now return to our orchard or flowergarden and behold now how the tree begin to fill with sap for the bring forth of the blossom and then of the fruitthe flower and the plant also their fragrancethis illustration plea me for very often when i be beginningand our lord grant that i have really begin to serve hi majestyi mean begin in relation to what i have to say of my lifeit be to me a great joy to consider my soul a a garden and our lord a walking in iti use to beseech him to increase the fragrance of the little flower of virtueswhich be begin a it seem to budand preserve them that they might be to hi glory for i desire nothing for myselfi pray him to cut those he like because i already know that they would grow the good i say cut for there be time in which the soul have no recollection of this gardeneverything seem parch and there be no water to be have for preserve itand in which it seem a if the soul have never possess any virtue at allthis be the season of heavy trial for our lord will have the poor gardener suppose all the trouble he take in maintaining and water the garden to have be take to no purposethen be the time really for weed and root out every plant however small it may be that be worthless in the knowledge that no effort of ours be sufficient if god withhold from u the water of hi grace and in despise ourselves a be nothing and even less than nothingin this way we gain great humilitythe flower grow afresh o my lord and my good i can notutter these word without tear and rejoice in my soul for thou wilt be thus with u and art with u in the sacramentwe may believe so most truly for so it be and the comparison i make be a great truth and if our sin stand notin the way we may rejoice in thee because thou rejoicest in u for thou hast tell u that thy delight be to be with the child of men o my lord what do it mean whenever i hear these word they always give me great consolation and do so even when i be most wicked be it possible lord that there can be a soul which after attain to this state wherein thou bestowest upon it the like grace and consolation and wherein it understand that thou delightest to be with it can yet fall back and offend thee after so many favour and such great demonstration of the love thou bearest it and of which there can notbe any doubt because the effect of it be so visible such a soul there certainly be for i have do so notonce but oftenmay it please thy goodness o lord that i may be alone in my ingratitudethe only one who have commit so great an iniquity and whose ingratitude have be so immeasurable but even out of my ingratitude thine infinite goodness have bring forth some good and the great my wickedness the great the splendour of the great mercy of thy compassionsoh what reason have i to magnify them for ever may it be so i beseech thee o my god and may i sing of them for ever now that thou hast be please to show mercy so great unto me that they who see them be astonished mercy which draw me out of myself continually that i may praise thee more and more for remain in myself without thee i could do nothing o my lord but be a the withered flower of the garden so that this miserable earth of mine become a heap of refuse a it be beforelet it notbe so o lordlet nota soul which thou hast purchase with so many labour be lose one which thou hast so often ransomed anew and deliver from between the teeth of the hideous dragon you my father must forgive me for wander from the subject and a i be speak to the purpose i have in view you must notbe surprisedwhat i write be what my soul have understand and it be very often hard enough to abstain from the praise of god when in the course of write the great debt i owe him present itself before menor do i think that it can be disagreeable to you because both of u i believe may sing the same song though in a different way for my debt be much the great see that god have forgive me more a you my father know instruction for those who have attain to the prayer of quietmany advance so far but few go farther let u now go back to the subjectthis quiet and recollection of the soul make itself in great measure felt in the satisfaction and peace attend with very great joy and repose of the faculty and most sweet delight wherein the soul be establish it think because it have notgo beyond it that there be nothing far to wish for but that it abode might be there and it would willingly say so with stpeter it dare notmove nor stir because it think that this bless it have receive must then escape out of it hand now and then it could wish it do noteven breathe the poor little soul be notaware that a of itself it could do nothing to draw down this blessing on itself it be still less able to retain it a moment long than our lord will it should remain i have already say that in the prior recollection and quiet there be no failure of the power of the soul but the soul be so satisfied in god that although two of it power be distract yet while the recollection last a the will abide in union with god so it peace and quiet be notdisturb on the contrary the will by degree brings the understanding and the memory back again for though the will be notyet altogether absorb it continue still occupy without know how so that notwithstanding all the effort of the memory and the understanding they can notrob it of it delight and joy yea rather it help without any labour at all to keep this little spark of the love of god from be quench oh that hi majesty would be gracious unto me and enable me to give a clear account of the matter for many be the soul who attain to this state and few be they who go far and i know notwho be in fault most certainly it be notgod for when hi majesty show mercy unto a soul so that it advance so far i believe that he will notfail to be more merciful still if there be no shortcoming on our part and it be of great importance for the soul that have advance so far a this to understand the great dignity of it state the great grace give it by our lord and how in all reason it should notbelong to earth because he of hi goodness seem to make it here a denizen of heaven unless it be itself in faultand miserable will that soul be if it turn back it will go down i think so even to the abyss a i be go myself if the mercy of our lord have notbring me back because for the most part it must be the effect of grave faultsthat be my opinion nor be it possible to forsake so great a good otherwise than through the blindness occasion by much evil therefore for the love of our lord i implore those soul to whom hi majesty have give so great a gracethe attainment of this stateto know and make much of themselves with a humble and holy presumption in order that they may never return to the fleshpots of egyptand if through weakness and wickedness and a mean and wretched nature they should fall a i do let them always keep in mind the good they have lose let them suspect and fearthey have reason to do sothat if they do notresume their prayer they may go on from bad to worsei call that a real fall which make u hate the way by which so great a good be obtainedi address myself to those soul but i be notsay that they will never offend god nor fall into sinthough there be good reason why those who have receive these grace should keep themselves carefully from sin but we be miserable creatureswhat i earnestly advise be this let there be no give up of prayer it be by prayer they will understand what they be do and obtain from our lord the grace to repent and strength to rise again they must believe and believe again that if they cease from pray they runso i thinkinto dangeri know notif i understand what i be say for a i say before i measure other by myself the prayer of quiet then be a little spark of the true love of himself which our lord begin to enkindle in the soul and hi will be that the soul should understand what this love be by the joy it bringsthis quiet and recollection and little spark if it be the work of the spirit of god and nota sweetness supply by satan or bring about by ourselves produce great resultsa person of experience however can notpossibly fail to understand at once that it be nota thing that can be acquire be it notthat our nature be so greedy of sweetness that it seek for it in every waybut it become cold very soon for however much we try to make the fire burn in order to obtain this sweetness it do notappear that we do anything els but throw water on it to put it outthis spark then give of god however slight it may be cause a great crackling and if men do notquench it by their fault it be the beginning of the great fire which send forthi shall speak of it in the proper place the flame of that most vehement love of god which hi majesty will have perfect soul to possess this little spark be a sign or pledge which god give to a soul in token of hi have choose it for great thing if it will prepare to receive themit be a great gift much too great for me to be able to speak of itit be a great sorrow to me because a i say before i know that many soul come thus far and that those who go far a they ought to go be so few that i be ashamed to say iti do notmean that they be absolutely few there must be many because god be patient with u for some reason i speak of what i have see i should like much to recommend these soul to take care that they do nothide their talent for it may be that god have choose them to be the edification of many other especially in these day when the friend of god should be strong in order that they may support the weakthose who discern in themselves this grace must look upon themselves a such friend if they would fulfil the law which even the honourable friendship of the world respect if nota i say just now let them fear and tremble l they should be do mischief to themselvesand god grant it be to themselves only what the soul have to do at those season wherein it be raise to the prayer of quiet be nothing more than to be gentle and without noiseby noise i mean go about with the understanding in search of word and reflection whereby to give god thanks for this grace and heap up it sin and imperfection together to show that it do notdeserve itall this commotion take place now and the understanding come forward and the memory be restless and certainly to me these power bring much weariness at time for though my memory be notstrong i can notcontrol itlet the will quietly and wisely understand that it be notby dint of labour on our part that we can converse to any good purpose with god and that our own effort be only great log of wood lay on without discretion to quench this little spark and let it confess this and in humility say o lord what can i do here what have the servant to do with her lord and earth with heaven or word of love that suggest themselves now firmly ground in the conviction that what it say be truth and let it make no account of the understanding which be simply tiresome and if the will wish to communicate to the understand any portion of that the fruition of which itself have enter on or if it labour to make the understanding recollect it shall notsucceed for it will often happen that the will be in union and at rest while the understanding be in extreme disorderit be well for it to leave it alone and notto run after iti be speaking of the will for the will should abide in the fruition of that grace recollect itself like the prudent bee for if no bee enter the hive and each of them wander abroad in search of the rest the honey would hardly be madein the same way the soul will lose much if it be notcareful now especially if the understanding be acute for when it begin to make reflection and search for reason it will think at once that it be do something if it reason and reflection be good the only reason that ought to be admit now be to understand clearly that there be no reason whatever except hi mere goodness why god should grant u so great a grace and to be aware that we be so near him and to pray to hi majesty for mercy to make intercession for the church for those who have be recommend to u and for the soul in purgatorynot however with noise of word but with a heartfelt desire to be heardthis be a prayer that contain much and by it more be obtain than by many reflection of the understandinglet the will stir up some of those reason which proceed from reason itself to quicken it love such a the fact of it be in a good state and let it make certain act of love a what it will do for him to whom it owe so muchand that a i say just now without any noise of the understanding in the search after profound reflectionsa little strawand it will be less than straw if we bring it ourselveslaid on with humility will be more effectual here and will help to kindle a fire more than many fagot of most learn reason which in my opinion will put it out in a moment this be good for those learn men who have command me to write and who all by the goodness of god have come to this state for it may be that they spend the time in make application of passage of the scripturesand though learning could notfail to be of great use to them both before and after prayer still in the very time of prayer itself there be little necessity for it in my opinion unless it be for the purpose of make the will tepid for the understanding then because of it nearness to the light be itself illuminate so that even i who be what i be seem to be a different personand so it be for it have happen to me who scarcely understand a word of what i read in latin and specially in the psalm when in the prayer of quiet notonly to understand the latin a if it be spanish but still more to take a delight in dwell on the meaning of that i know through the spanishwe must make an exception if these learn men have to preach or to teach they will do well to take advantage of their learning that they may help poor people of little learning of whom i be onecharity be a great thing and so always be minister unto soul when do simply for god so then when the soul be in the prayer of quiet let it repose in it restlet learning be put on one sidethe time will come when they may make use of it in the service of our lordwhen they that posse it will appreciate it so highly a to be glad that they have notneglect it even for all the treasure of the world simply because it enable them to serve hi majesty for it be a great helpbut in the eye of infinite wisdom believe me a little striving after humility and a single act thereof be worth more than all the science in the worldthis be notthe time for discuss but for understand plainly what we be and present ourselves in simplicity before god who will have the soul make itself a a foolas indeed it isin hi presence see that hi majesty so humbles himself a to suffer it to be near him we be what we be moreover the understanding bestir itself to make it thanksgiving in phrase well arranged but the will in peace notdare to lift up it eye with the publican make perhaps a good act of thanksgiving than the understanding with all the trope of it rhetoricin a word mental prayer be notto be abandon altogether now nor even vocal prayer if at any time we wish or can to make use of either of them for if the state of quiet be profound it become difficult to speak and it can be do only with great pain i believe myself that we know whether this proceeds from the spirit of god or be bring about by endeavour of our own in the commencement of devotion which god give and we seek of ourselves a i say before to pass onwards to this quiet of the willthen no effect whatever be produce it be quickly over and aridity be the resultif it come from satan the practised soul in my opinion will detect it because it leave trouble behind and scant humility and poor disposition for those effect which be wrought if it come from god it leave neither light in the understanding nor steadiness in the truth here satan can do little or no harm if the soul direct unto god the joy and sweetness it then feel and if it fix the thought and desire on him accord to the advice already give the devil can gain nothing whateveron the contrary by the permission of god he will lose much by that very joy which he cause in the soul because that joy will help the soul inasmuch a it think the joy come from god to betake itself often to prayer in it desire for itand if the soul be humble indifferent to and detach from all joy however spiritual and if it love the cross it will make no account of the sweetness which satan sendsbut it can notso deal with that which come from the spirit of god of that it will make muchnow when satan send it a he be nothing but a lie and when he see that the soul humble itself through that joy and sweetnessand here in all thing relate to prayer and sweetness we must be very careful to endeavour to make ourselves humblesatan will notoften repeat hi work when he see that he lose by it for this and for many other reason when i be speak of the first degree of prayer and of the first method of draw the water i insist upon it that the great affair of soul be when they begin to pray to begin also to detach themselves from every kind of joy and to enter on it resolve only on help to carry the cross of christ like good soldier willing to serve their king without present pay because they be sure of it at last have their eye direct to the true and everlasting kingdom at the conquest of which we be aim it be a very great matter to have this always before our eye especially in the beginning afterwards it become so clear that it be rather a matter of necessity to forget it in order to live onnow labour to keep in mind that all thing here below be of short duration that they be all nothing that the rest we have here be to be account a noneall this i say seem to be exceedingly low and so indeed it isbecause those who have go on to great perfection would look upon it a a reproach and be ashamed of themselves if they think that they be give up the good of this world because they be perishable or that they would notbe glad to give them up for godeven if they be to last for everthe great the perfection of these person the great their joy and the great also would that joy be if the duration of these worldly good be great in these person thus far advanced love be already grown and love be that which do this workbut a to beginner to them it be of the utmost importance and they must notregard this consideration a unbecoming for the blessing to be gain be greatand that be why i recommend it so much to them for they will have need of iteven those who have attain to great height of prayerat certain time when god will try them and when hi majesty seem to have forsake them i have say a much already and i would nothave it forget in this our life on earth the growth of the soul be notlike that of the bodywe however so speak of itand in truth it do growa youth that be grow up whose body be form and who be become a man do notungrow nor do hi body lessen in size but a to the soul it so be by our lord will so far a i have see it in my own experiencebut i know nothing of it in any other wayit must be in order to humble u for our great good and to keep u from be careless during our exile seeing that he who have ascend the high have the more reason to be afraid and to be less confident in himselfa time may come when they whose will be so wrapt up in the will of godand who rather than fall into a single imperfection would undergo torture and suffer a thousand deathswill find it necessary if they would be deliver from offend god and from the commission of sin to make use of the first armour of prayer to call to mind how everything be come to an end that there be a heaven and a hell and to make use of other reflection of that nature when they find themselves assail by temptation and persecution let u go back to what i be sayingthe great source of our deliverance from the cunning device and the sweetness which satan send be to begin with a resolution to walk in the way of the cross from the very first and notto desire any sweetness at all see that our lord himself have point out to u the way of perfection say take up thy cross and follow me he be our example and whosoever follow hi counsel only to please him have nothing to fearin the improvement which they detect in themselves they who do so will see that this be no work of satan and if they fall they have a sign of the presence of our lord in their rising again at oncethey have other sign also of which i be go to speak when it be the work of the spirit of god there be no necessity for go about search for reason on the strength of which we may elicit act of humility and of shame because our lord himself supply them in a way very different from that by which we could acquire them by our own poor reflection which be a nothing in comparison with that real humility arise out of the light which our lord here give u and which beget a confusion of face that undo usthe knowledge with which god supply u in order that we may know that of ourselves we have no good in u be perfectly apprehendedand the more perfectly the great the gracesit fill u with a great desire of advance in prayer and of never give it up whatever trouble may arisethe soul offer to suffer everythinga certain security join with humility and fear concern our salvation cast out servile fear at once from the soul and in it place plant a loyal fear of more perfect growth there be a visible beginning of a love of god utterly divest of all selfinterest together with a longing after season of solitude in order to obtain a great fruition of this good in short notto weary myself it be the beginning of all good the flower have so thrive that they be on the point of buddingand this the soul see most clearly and it be impossible to persuade it now that god be notwith it till it turn back upon itself and behold it own failing and imperfectionsthen it fear for everything and it be well it should do sothough there be souls whom the certain conviction that god be with them benefit more than all the fear they may ever haveif a soul love greatly and be thankful naturally the remembrance of the mercy of god make it turn to him more effectually than all the chastisement of hell it can ever picture to itselfat least it be so with me though i be so wicked a i shall speak at great length of the sign of a good spirit it have cost me much labour to be clear about themi do nottreat of them herei believe too that with the help of god i shall be able to speak somewhat to the point becausesetting aside the experience i have have and by which i learn muchi have have the help of some most learned men and person of great holiness whom we may reasonably believe in the mattersouls therefore be notto weary themselves so much a i do when by the goodness of our lord they may have come to this state the third state of prayerdeep matterswhat the soul can do that ha reach iteffects of the great grace of our lord let u now speak of the third water wherewith this garden be wateredwater run from a river or from a brookwhereby the garden be water with very much less trouble although there be some in direct the water in this state our lord will help the gardener and in such a way a to be a it be the gardener himself do all the workit be a sleep of the power of the soul which be notwholly lose nor yet understand how they be at workthe pleasure sweetness and delight be incomparably great than in the former state of prayer and the reason be that the water of grace have rise up to the neck of the soul so that it can neither advance nor retreatnor do it know how to do so it seek only the fruition of exceed blissit be like a die man with the candle in hi hand on the point of die the death desiredit be rejoice in this agony with unutterable joy to me it seem to be nothing els but a death a it be to all the thing of this world and a fruition of godi know of no other word whereby to describe it or to explain it neither do the soul then know what to dofor it know notwhether to speak or be silent whether it should laugh or weepit be a glorious folly a heavenly madness wherein true wisdom be acquire and to the soul a kind of fruition most full of delight it be now some five or six year i believe since our lord raise me to this state of prayer in it ful and that more than onceand i never understand it and never could explain it and so i be resolve when i should come thus far in my story to say very little or nothing at alli knew well enough that it be notaltogether the union of all the faculty and yet most certainly it be high than the previous state of prayer but i confess that i could notdetermine and understand the difference the humility of your reverence willing to be help by a simplicity so great a mine have be the cause i believe why our lord today after communion admit me to this state of prayer without the power of go further and suggest to me these comparison and teach me how to speak of it and of what the soul must do thereincertainly i be amaze and in a moment understood it alli have often be thus a it be beside myself drink with love and yet never could understand how it wasi knew well that it be the work of god but i never be able to understand the manner of hi work here for in fact the faculty be almost all completely in union yet notso absorbed that they do notacti have be singularly delight in that i have be able to comprehend the matter at lastblessed be our lord who have thus console me the faculty of the soul now retain only the power of occupy themselves wholly with god notone of them venture to stir neither can we move one of them without make great effort to distract ourselvesand indeed i do notthink we can do it at all at this timemany word be then utter in praise of godbut disorderly unless it be that our lord order them himselfat least the understanding be utterly powerless here the soul long to send forth word of praise but it have no control over itselfit be in a state of sweet restlessnessthe flower be already open they be begin to send forth their fragrance the soul in this state would have all men behold and know of it bliss to the praise of god and help it to praise himit would have them to be partaker of it joy for it joy be great than it can bearit seem to me that it be like the woman in the gospel who would or use to call in her neighbour the admirable spirit of david the royal prophet must have felt in the same way so it seem to me when he play on the harp sing the praise of godi have a very great devotion to this glorious king and i wish all have it particularly those who be sinner like myself o my god what must that soul be when it be in this state it wish it be all tongue in order that it may praise our lordit utter a thousand holy folly strive continually to please him by whom it be thus possessedi know one who though she be no poet yet compose without any preparation certain stanzas full of feel most expressive of her pain they be notthe work of her own understanding but in order to have a great fruition of that bliss which so sweet a pain occasion her she complain of it in that way to godshe be willing to be cut in piece soul and body to show the delight she felt in that painto what torment could she be then expose that would notbe delicious to endure for her lord she see clearly that the martyr do little or nothing so far a they be concern when they endure their torture because the soul be well aware that it strength be derive from another source but what will be it suffering when it return to the use of the sens to live in the world and go back to the anxiety and the fashion thereof i do notthink that i have exaggerate in any way but rather have fall short in speaking of that joy which our lord of hi good pleasure give to the soul in this it exileblessed for ever be thou o lord and may all create thing praise thee for ever o my king see that i be now while write this still under the power of this heavenly madness an effect of thy mercy and goodnessand it be a mercy i never deservedgrant i beseech thee that all those with whom i may have to converse may become mad through thy love or let me converse with none or so order it that i may have nothing to do in the world or take me away from itthis thy servant o my god be no longer able to endure suffering so great a those be which she must bear when she see herself without thee if she must live she seek no repose in this lifeand do thou give her nonethis my soul longs to be freeeating be kill it and sleep be wearisome it see itself waste the time of this life in comfort and that there be no comfort for it now but in thee it seem to be live contrary to naturefor now it desire to live notin itself but in thee o my true lord and my happiness what a cross hast thou prepare for those who attain to this statelight and most heavy at the same time light because sweet heavy because now and then there be no patience leave to endure itand yet the soul never wish to be deliver from it unless it be that it may come to theewhen the soul remember that it have never serve thee at all and that by live on it may do thee some service it long for a still heavy cross and never to die before the end of the worldits own repose it count a nothing in comparison with do a slight service to theeit know notwhat to desire but it clearly understand that it desire nothing els but thee o my son so humble be he to whom this writing be direct and who have command me to write that he suffer himself to be thus addressedyou my father only must see these thing in which i seem to have transgress all bound for no reason can keep me reasonable when our lord draw me out of myselfsince my communion this morning i do notbelieve that i be the person who be speak i seem to be dream the thing i see and i wish i might never see any but people ill a i be nowi beseech you my father let u all be mad for the love of him who for our sake suffer men to say of him that he be mad you my father say that you wish me welli wish you would prove it by dispose yourself so that god may bestow this grace upon you for i see very few people who have nottoo much sense for everything they have to do and it may be that i have more than anybody elseyour reverence must notallow it you be my father for you be my confessor and the person to whom i have trust my soul disperse my delusion by tell the truth for truth of this sort be very rarely tell i wish we five who now love one another in our lord have make some such arrangement as this a other in these time have meet together in secret to plot wickedness and heresy against hi majesty so we might contrive to meet together now and then in order to undeceive one another to tell each other wherein we might improve ourselves and be more please unto god for there be no one that know himself as well a he be know of other who see him if it be with eye of love and the wish to do him goodi say in secret for language of this kind be no longer in use even preacher go about arrange their sermon so a to displease no one they have a good intention and their work be good yet still few amend their livesbut how be it that they be notmany who in consequence of these sermon abstain from public sin well i think it be because the preacher be highly sensible menthey be notburn with the great fire of the love of god a the apostle be cast worldly prudence aside and so their fire throw out but little heati do notsay that their fire ought to burn like that of the apostle but i do wish it be a strong fire than i see it isdo you my father know wherein much of this fire consist in the hatred of this life in the desertion of it honour in be utterly indifferent whether we lose or gain anything or everything provide the truth be tell and maintain for the glory of god for he who be courageously in earnest for god look upon loss or gain indifferentlyi do notsay that i be a person of this kind but i wish i be oh grand freedom to regard it a a captivity to be oblige to live and converse with men accord to the law of the world it be the gift of our lord there be nota slave who would notimperil everything that he might escape and return to hi country and a this be the true road there be no reason why we should linger for we shall never effectually gain a treasure so great so long a this life be notendedmay our lord give u hi grace for that end you my father if it shall seem good to you will tear up what i have write and consider it a a letter for yourself alone and forgive me that i have be very bold the third state of prayerthe effect thereofthe hindrance cause by the imagination and the memory enough have be say of this manner of prayer and of what the soul have to do or rather to speak more correctly of what god be do within it for it be he who now take upon himself the gardener work and who will have the soul take it ease except that the will be consent to the grace the fruition of which it have and that it must resign itself to all that the true wisdom would accomplish in itfor which it be certain it have need of courage because the joy be so great that the soul seem now and then to be on the very point of go forth out of the body and what a blessed death that would be now i think it be for the souls goodas you my father have be toldto abandon itself into the arm of god altogether if he will take it to heaven let it go if to hell no matter a it be go thither with it sovereign goodif life be to come to an end for ever so it will if it be to last a thousand year it will that also hi majesty may do with it a with hi own propertythe soul no longer belong to itself it have be give wholly to our lord let it cast all care utterly away my meaning be that in a state of prayer so high a this the soul understand that god be do hi work without any fatiguing of the understanding except that a it seem to me it be a if amaze in behold our lord take upon himself the work of the good gardener refuse to let the soul undergo any labour whatever but that of take it pleasure in the flower begin to send forth their fragrance for when god raise a soul up to this state it can do all this and much morefor these be the effect of it in one of these visit how brief soever it may be the gardener be who he isin a word the creator of the waterpours the water without stint and what the poor soul with the labour perhaps of twenty year in fatigue the understanding could notbring about that the heavenly gardener accomplishes in an instant cause the fruit both to grow and ripen so that the soul such be the will of our lord may derive it sustenance from it gardenbut he allow it notto divide the fruit with other until by eat thereof it be strong enough notto waste it in the mere tasting of itgiving to him none of the produce nor make any compensation for it to him who supply itlest it should be maintain other feed them at it own cost and itself perhaps die of hunger the meaning of this be perfectly clear for those who have understand enough to apply itmuch more clear than i can make it and i be tire finally the virtue be now strong than they be during the precede prayer of quiet for the soul see itself to be other than it be and it know nothow it be begin to do great thing in the odour which the flower send forth it be our lord will that the flower should open in order that the soul may believe itself to be in possession of virtue though it see most clearly that it can notand never could acquire them in many year and that the heavenly gardener have give them to it in that instantnow too the humility of the soul be much great and deep than it be before because it see more clearly that it do neither much nor little beyond give it consent that our lord might work those grace in it and then accept them willingly this state of prayer seem to me to be a most distinct union of the whole soul with god but for this that hi majesty appear to give the faculty leave to be intent upon and have the fruition of the great work he be do thenit happens at time and indeed very often that the will be in union the soul should be aware of it and see that the will be a captive and in joy that the will alone be abide in great peacewhile on the other hand the understanding and the memory be so free that they can be employ in affair and be occupy in work of charityi say this that you my father may see it be so and understand the matter when it shall happen to yourself at least it carry me out of myself and that be the reason why i speak of it here it differ from the prayer of quiet of which i have speak though it do seem a if it be all one with itin that prayer the soul which would willingly neither stir nor move be delight in the holy repose of mary but in this prayer it can be like martha also accordingly the soul be a it be live the active and contemplative life at once and be able to apply itself to work of charity and the affair of it state and to spiritual readingstill those who arrive at this state be notwholly master of themselves and be well aware that the good part of the soul be elsewhereit be a if we be speak to one person and another speaking to u at the same time while we ourselves be notperfectly attentive either to the one or the otherit be a state that be most easily ascertain and one when attain to that minister great joy and contentment and that prepare the soul in the high degree by observe time of solitude or of freedom from business for the attainment of the most tranquil quietudeit be like the life of a man who be full require no food with hi appetite satisfy so that he will noteat of everything set before him yet notso full either a to refuse to eat if he saw any desirable foodso the soul have no satisfaction in the world and seek no pleasure in it then because it have in itself that which give it a great satisfaction great joy in god longing for the satisfaction of it longing to have a deep joy in be with himthis be what the soul seek there be another kind of union which though nota perfect union be yet more so than the one of which i have just speak but notso much so a this spoken of a the third watery my father will be delight greatly if our lord should bestow them all upon you if you have them notalready to find an account of the matter in write and to understand it for it be one grace that our lord give grace and it be another grace to understand what grace and what gift it be and it be another and far grace to have the power to describe and explain it to othersthough it do notseem that more than the first of thesethe give of the graceis necessary to enable the soul to advance without confusion and fear and to walk with the great courage in the way of our lord trample under foot all the thing of this world it be a great advantage and a great grace to understand it for every one who have it have great reason to praise our lord and so also have he who have it notbecause hi majesty have bestow it upon some person live who be to make u profit by it this union of which i would now speak frequently occur particularly to myselfgod have very often bestow such a grace upon me whereby he constrain the will and even the understanding a it seem to me see that it make no reflection but be occupy in the fruition of god like a person who look on and see so many thing that he know notwhere to lookone object put another out of sight and none of them leave any impression behind the memory remain free and it must be so together with the imagination and so when it find itself alone it be marvellous to behold what war it make on the soul and how it labour to throw everything into disorderas for me i be weary by it and i hate it and very often do i implore our lord to deprive me of it on these occasion if i be to be so much trouble by itnow and then i say to him o my god when shall my soul praise thee without distraction notdissipate in this way unable to control itself i understand now the mischief that sin have do in that it have render u unable to do what we desireto be always occupy in god i say that it happen to me from time to timeit have do so this very day and so i remember it wellto see my soul tear itself in order to find itself there where the great part of it be and to see at the same time that it be impossible because the memory and the imagination assail it with such force that it can notprevail against them yet a the other faculty give them no assistance they be notable to do it any harmnone whatever they do enough when they trouble it restwhen i say they do no harm my meaning be that they can notreally hurt it because they have notstrength enough and because they be too discursiveas the understanding give no help neither much nor little in the matter put before the soul they never rest anywhere but hurry to and fro like nothing els but gnat at night troublesome and unquiet and so they go about from one subject to another this comparison seem to me to be singularly to the purpose for the memory and the imagination though they have no power to do any harm be very troublesomei know of no remedy for it and hitherto god have tell me of noneif he have most gladly would i make use of it for i be a i say tormented very oftenthis show our wretchedness and bring out most distinctly the great power of god see that the faculty which be free hurt and wearies u so much while the other occupy with hi majesty give u rest the only remedy i have find after many year of weariness be that i speak of when i be describe the prayer of quiet to make no more account of it than of a madman but let it go with it subject for god alone can take it from itin short it be a slave herewe must bear patiently with it a jacob bore with lia for our lord showeth u mercy enough when we be allow to have rachel with u i say that it remain a slave for after all let it do what it will it can notdrag the other faculty in it train on the contrary they without take any trouble compel it to follow after themsometimes god be pleased to take pity on it when he see it so lose and so unquiet through the longing it have to be unite with the other faculty and hi majesty consent to it burn itself in the flame of that divine candle by which the other be already reduce to ash and their nature lose be a it be supernaturally in the fruition of blessing so great in all these state of prayer of which i have speak while explain this last method of draw the water out of the well so great be the bliss and repose of the soul that even the body most distinctly share in it joy and delightand this be most plain and the virtue continue to grow a i say before it seem to have be the good pleasure of our lord to explain these state of prayer wherein the soul find itself with the utmost clearness possible i think here on earth do you my father discus it with any spiritual person who have arrive at this state and be learnedif he say of it it be well you may believe that god have speak it and you will give thanks to hi majesty for a i say just now in the course of time you will rejoice greatly in that you have understand itmeanwhile if he do notallow you to understand what it be though he do give you the possession of it yet with your intellect and learn see that hi majesty have give you the first you will know what it be by the help of what i have write hereunto him be praise for ever and ever amen the fourth state of prayerthe great dignity of the soul raise to it by our lordattainable on earth notby our merit but by the goodness of our lord may our lord teach me word whereby i may in some measure describe the fourth water i have great need of hi helpeven more than i have while speaking of the last for in that the soul still feel that it be notdead altogetherwe may thus speak see that to the world it be really deadbut a i have say it retain the sense to see that it be in the world and to feel it own loneliness and it make use of that which be outward for the purpose of manifest it feeling at least by signsin the whole of the prayer already speak of and in all the state of it the gardener undergo some labour though in the late state the labour be attend with so much bliss and comfort of the soul that the soul would never willingly pass out of itand thus the labour be notfelt a labour but a bliss in this the fourth state there be no sense of anything only fruition without understand what that be the fruition of which be grantedit be understood that the fruition be of a certain good containing in itself all good together at once but this good be notcomprehendedthe sens be all occupy in this fruition in such a way that notone of them be at liberty so a to be able to attend to anything els whether outward or inward the sens be permit before a i have say to give some sign of the great joy they feel but now in this state the joy of the soul be incomparably great and the power of show it be still less for there be no power in the body and the soul have none whereby this fruition can be make knowneverything of that kind would be a great hindrance a torment and a disturbance of it restand i say if it really be a union of all the faculty that the soul even if it wishedi mean when it be in unioncannot make it know and if it can then it be notunion at all how this which we call union be effect and what it be i can nottellmystical theology explain it and i do notknow the term of that science nor can i understand what the mind be nor how it differ from the soul or the spirit either all three seem to me but one though i do know that the soul sometimes leap forth out of itself like a fire that be burn and be become a flame and occasionally this fire increase violentlythe flame ascend high above the fire but it be nottherefore a different thing it be still the same flame of the same fireyour learn my father will enable you to understand the matter i can go no further what i undertake to explain be that which the soul feel when it be in the divine unionit be plain enough what union istwo distinct thing become oneo my lord how good thou art bless be thou for ever o my god let all creature praise thee who hast so loved u that we can truly speak of this communication which thou hast with soul in this our exile yea even if they be good soul it be on thy part great munificence and magnanimityin a word it be thy munificence o my lord seeing that thou givest like thyselfo infinite munificencehow magnificent be thy work even he whose understanding be notoccupy with the thing of earth be amaze that he be unable to understand these truthswhy then give grace so high to souls who have be such great sinner truly this passeth my understanding and when i come to think of it i can get no furtheris there any way at all for me to go on which be nota go back for a to give thee thanks for mercy so great i know nothow to do itsometimes i relieve myself by give utterance to folliesit often happen to me either when i receive these grace or when god be about to bestow themfor in the midst of them i have already say i be able to do nothingthat i would break out into word like these o lord consider what thou art do forget notso soon the great evils that i have doneto forgive me thou must already have forget them yet in order that there may be some limit to thy grace i beseech thee remember themo my creator pour nota liquor so precious into a vessel so broken for thou hast already see how on other occasion i allow it to run wastelay notup treasure like this where the longing after the consolation of this life be notso mortified a it ought to be for it will be utterly losthow canst thou commit the defence of the city and the key of it fortress to a commander so cowardly who at the first assault will let the enemy enter within oh let notthy love be so great o king eternal a to imperil jewel so precious o my lord to me it seem that it become a ground for undervalue them when thou puttest them in the power of one so wretched so vile so frail so miserable and so worthless a i be who though she may labour notto lose them by the help of thy graceand i have need of no little grace for that end be what i amis notable to win over any one to theein short i be a woman notgood but wickedit seem to me that the talent be notonly hidden but bury when they be commit to earth so vileit be notthy wont o lord to bestow grace and mercy like these upon a soul unless it be that it may edify many thou o my god knowest already that i beg this of thee with my whole will from the bottom of my heart and that i have do so more than once and i account it a blessing to lose the great blessing which may be have on earth if thou wouldst but bestow these grace upon him who will make a good use of them to the increase of thy glorythese and expression like these it have happen to me often to utteri saw afterwards my own foolishness and want of humility for our lord knoweth well what be expedient and that there be no strength in my soul to be save if hi majesty do notgive it with grace so great i purpose also to speak of the grace and effect which abide in the soul and of that which the soul itself can do or rather if it can do anything of itself towards attain to a state so highthe elevation of the spirit or union come together with heavenly love but a i understand it union be a different thing from elevation in union itselfto him who may nothave have any experience of the latter it must seem that it be notand accord to my view of it even if they be both one the operation of our lord therein be different there be a growth of the souls detachment from creature more abundantly still in the flight of the spirit i have clearly see that this be a particular grace though a i say it may be the same or seem to be so with the other but a little fire also be as much fire a a great fireand yet there be a visible difference between thembefore a small piece of iron be make redhot in a little fire some time must pass but if the fire be great the iron very quickly though bulky lose it nature altogether in appearance so it seem to me be it with these two kind of grace which our lord bestowshe who have have rapture will i be sure understand it well to him who have nothave that experience it must appear follyand indeed it may well be so for if a person like myself should speak of a matter of this kind and give any explanation at all of that for the description of which no word ever can possibly be find it be notto be wonder at that i may be speak foolishly but i have this confidence in our lord that he will help me here for hi majesty knoweth that my object in writingthe first be to obeyis to inspire soul with a longing after so high a goodi will speak of nothing that i do notknow by great experience and so when i begin to describe the last kind of water i think it more impossible for me to speak of it at all than to speak greekit be a very difficult matter so i leave it and go to communionblessed be our lord who be merciful to the ignorant oh virtue of obedience it can do everything god enlighten my understandingat one time suggest the word at another show me how to use them for a in the precede state of prayer so also now hi majesty seem to utter what i can neither speak nor understand what i be say be the simple truth and therefore whatever be good herein be hi teach what be erroneous clearly come out of that sea of evilmyselfif there be anyand there must be manywho have attain to these state of prayer whereunto our lord in hi mercy have bring mewretch that i amand who think they have miss their way desire to treat of these matter with me i be sure that our lord will help hi servant to declare the truth more plainly i be now speak of the water which cometh down from heaven to fill and saturate in it abundance the whole of this garden with waterif our lord never cease to pour it down whenever it be necessary the gardener certainly would have plenty of rest and if there be no winter but an ever temperate season fruit and flower would never failthe gardener would have hi delight therein but in this life that be impossiblewe must always be careful when one water fail to obtain anotherthis water from heaven come down very often when the gardener least expect it the truth be that in the beginning this almost always happen after much mental prayerour lord advance step by step to lay hold of the little bird and to lay it in the nest where it may reposehe observe it flutter for a long time strive with the understanding and the will and with all it might to seek god and to please him so now it be hi pleasure to reward it even in this lifeand what a rewardone moment be enough to repay all the possible trial of this life the soul while thus seek after god be conscious with a joy excessive and sweet that it be a it be utterly faint away in a kind of trance breathing and all the bodily strength fail it so that it can noteven move the hand without great pain the eye close involuntarily and if they be open they be a if they saw nothing nor be read possiblethe very letter seem strange and can notbe distinguishedthe letter indeed be visible but a the understanding furnish no help all reading be impracticable though seriously attemptedthe ear hears but what be hear be notcomprehendedthe sens be of no use whatever except to hinder the souls fruition and so they rather hurt itit be useless to try to speak because it be notpossible to conceive a word nor if it be conceive be there strength sufficient to utter it for all bodily strength vanishes and that of the soul increase to enable it the good to have the fruition of it joygreat and most perceptible also be the outward joy now felt this prayer however long it may last do no harmat least it have never do any to me nor do i remember however ill i might have be when our lord have mercy upon me in this way that i ever felt the worse for iton the contrary i be always well afterwardsbut so great a bless what harm can it do the outward effect be so plain a to leave no doubt possible that there must have be some great cause see that it thus rob u of our bodily power with so much joy in order to leave them great the truth be it pass away so quickly in the beginningat least so it be with methat neither by the outward sign nor by the failure of the sens can it be perceive when it pass so quickly awaybut it be plain from the overflow abundance of grace that the brightness of the sun which have shone there must have be great see that it have thus make the soul to melt awayand this be to be consider for a it seem to me the period of time however long it may have be during which the faculty of the soul be entrance be very short if half an hour that would be a long timei do notthink that i have ever be so long the truth of the matter be this it be extremely difficult to know how long because the sens be in suspense but i think that at any time it can notbe very long before some one of the faculty recovers itselfit be the will that persist in the work the other two faculty quickly begin to molest itas the will be calm it entrance them again they be quiet for another moment and then they recover themselves once more in this way some hour may be and be pass in prayer for when the two faculty begin to drink deep and to perceive the taste of this divine wine they give themselves up with great readiness in order to be the more absorbed they follow the will and the three rejoice togetherbut this state of complete absorption together with the utter rest of the imaginationfor i believe that even the imagination be then wholly at restlasts only for a short time though the faculty do notso completely recover themselves a notto be for some hour afterwards a if in disorder god from time to time draw them to himself let u now come to that which the soul feel interiorlylet him describe it who know it for a it be impossible to understand it much more be it so to describe itwhen i purpose to write this i have just communicate and have rise from the very prayer of which i be speakingi be think of what the soul be then doingour lord say to me it undo itself utterly my daughter in order that it may give itself more and more to me it be notitself that then live it be ia it can notcomprehend what it understand it understand by notunderstand he who have have experience of this will understand it in some measure for it can notbe more clearly describe because what then take place be so obscureall i be able to say be that the soul be represent a be close to god and that there abide a conviction thereof so certain and strong that it can notpossibly help believe soall the faculty fail now and be suspend in such a way that a i say before their operation can notbe tracedif the soul be make a meditation on any subject the memory of it be lose at once just a if it have never be think ofif it read what be read be notremember nor dwelt upon neither be it otherwise with vocal prayeraccordingly the restless little butterfly of the memory have it wing burn now and it can notflythe will must be fully occupy in love but it understand nothow it love the understanding if it understand do notunderstand how it understandsat least it can comprehend nothing of that it understand it do notunderstand a it seem to me because a i say just now this can notbe understoodi do notunderstand it at all myself in the beginning it happen to me that i be ignorant of one thingi do notknow that god be in all thing and when he seem to me to be so near i think it impossiblenot to believe that he be present be notin my power for it seem to me a it be evident that i felt there hi very presencesome unlearned men use to say to me that he be present only by hi gracei could notbelieve that because a i be say he seem to me to be present himself so i be distresseda most learned man of the order of the glorious patriarch stdominic deliver me from this doubt for he tell me that he be present and how he commune with u this be a great comfort to me it be to be observe and understood that this water from heaventhis great grace of our lordalways leave in the soul the great fruit a i shall now show the effect of this fourth state of prayerearnest exhortation to those who have attain to it notto go back nor to cease from prayer even if they fallthe great calamity of go back there remain in the soul when the prayer of union be over an exceedingly great tenderness so much so that it would undo itselfnot from pain but through tear of joy it find itself bath therein without be aware of it and it know nothow or when it weep thembut to behold the violence of the fire subdue by the water which yet make it burn the more give it great delightit seem a if i be speak an unknown languageso it be however it have happen to me occasionally when this prayer be over to be so beside myself a notto know whether i have be dream or whether the bliss i felt have really be mine and on find myself in a flood of tearswhich have painlessly flow with such violence and rapidity that it seem a if a cloud from heaven have shed themto perceive that it be no dreamthus it be with me in the beginning when it pass quickly awaythe soul remain possessed of so much courage that if it be now hew in piece for god it would be a great consolation to itthis be the time of resolution of heroic determination of the live energy of good desire of the beginning of hatred of the world and of the most clear perception of it vanitythe soul make great and high progress than it ever make before in the previous state of prayer and grows in humility more and more because it see clearly that neither for obtain nor for retain this grace great beyond all measure have it ever do or ever be able to do anything of itselfit look upon itself a most unworthyfor in a room into which the sunlight enters strongly nota cobweb can be hide it see it own misery selfconceit be so far away that it seem a if it never could have have anyfor now it own eye behold how very little it could ever do or rather that it never do anything that it hardly give even it own consent but that it rather seem a if the door of the sens be close against it will in order that it might have more abundantly the fruition of our lordit be abide alone with him what have it to do but to love him it neither see nor hears unless on compulsion no thanks to itits past life stand before it then together with the great mercy of god in great distinctness and it be notnecessary for it to go forth to hunt with the understanding because what it have to eat and ruminate upon it see now ready preparedit see so far a itself be concern that it have deserve hell and that it punishment be blissit undoes itself in the praise of god and i would gladly undo myself now bless be thou o my lord who out of a pool so filthy a i be bringest forth water so clean a to be meet for thy table praise be thou o joy of the angel who hast be thus pleased to exalt so vile a worm the good effect of this prayer abide in the soul for some timenow that it clearly apprehend that the fruit be notit own the soul can begin to share it with other and that without any loss to itselfit begin to show sign of it be a soul that be guard the treasure of heaven and to be desirous of communicate them to other and to pray to god that itself may notbe the only soul that be rich in themit begin to benefit it neighbour a it be without be aware of it or do anything consciously it neighbour understand the matter because the odour of the flower have grow so strong a to make them eager to approach themthey understand that this soul be full of virtue they see the fruit how delicious it be and they wish to help that soul to eat it if this ground be well dig by trouble by persecution detraction and infirmitiesthey be few who ascend so high without thisif it be well break up by great detachment from all selfinterest it will drink in so much water that it can hardly ever be parch againbut if it be grind which be mere waste and cover with thorn a i be when i begin if the occasion of sin be notavoid if it be an ungrateful soil unfit for so great a graceit will be parch up againif the gardener become carelessand if our lord out of hi mere goodness will notsend down rain upon itthe garden be ruinedthus have it be with me more than once so that i be amaze at it and if i have notfind it so by experience i could nothave believe it i write this for the comfort of soul which be weak a i be that they may never despair nor cease to trust in the power of god even if they should fall after our lord have raise them to so high a degree of prayer a this be they must notbe discourage unless they would lose themselves utterlytears gain everything and one drop of water attract another one of the reason that move me who be what i be under obedience to write this and give an account of my wretched life and of the grace our lord have work in methough i never serve him but offend him ratheris what i have just give and certainly i wish i be a person of great authority that people might believe what i sayi pray to our lord that hi majesty would be please to grant me this gracei repeat it let no one who have begin to give himself to prayer be discourage and say if i fall into sin it will be bad for me if i go on now with the practice of prayeri think so too if he give up prayer and do notcorrect hi evil way but if he do notgive up prayer let him be assure of thisprayer will bring him to the haven of light in this the devil turn hi battery against me and i suffer so much because i think it show but little humility if i persevere in prayer when i be so wicked thatas i have already say i give it up for a year and a halfat least for a year but i do notremember distinctly the other six monthsthis could nothave be neither be it anything els but to throw myself down into hell there be no need of any devil to drag me thithero my god be there ever blindness so great a this how well satan prepare hi measure for hi purpose when he pursue u in this way the traitor know that he have already lose that soul which persevere in prayer and that every fall which he can bring about help it by the goodness of god to make great progress in hi servicesatan have some interest in this o my jesus what a sight that must bea soul so highly exalted fall into sin and raise up again by thee who in thy mercy stretch forth thine hand to save how such a soul confess thy greatness and compassion and it own wretchedness it really look on itself a nothingness and confess thy powerit dare notlift up it eye it raise them indeed but it be to acknowledge how much it oweth unto theeit become devout to the queen of heaven that she may propitiate thee it invoke the saint who fell after thou hadst call them for succourthou seemest now to be too bountiful in thy gift because it feel itself to be unworthy of the earth it tread onit have recourse to the sacrament to a quicken faith which abide in it at the contemplation of the power which thou hast lodge in themit praise thee because thou hast leave u such medicine and ointment for our wound which notonly heal them on the surface but remove all trace whatever of them the soul be amaze at itwho be there o lord of my soul that be notamaze at compassion so great and mercy so surpass after treason so foul and so hateful i know not
