to hi book go little book thyself present a child whose parent be unkent to him that be the president of nobleness and chivalry and if that envy bark at thee a sure it will for succour flee under the shadow of hi wing and ask who thee forth do bring a shepheards swain say do thee sing all a hi stray flock he feed and when hi honour have thee read crave pardon for thy hardyhed but if that any ask thy name say thou wert basebegot with blame forthy thereof thou takest shame and when thou art past jeopardy come tell me what be say of me and i will send more after thee immerito to the most excellent and learned both orator and poet maister gabriel harvey hi very special and singular good friend e k commendeth the good liking of this hi good labour and the patronage of the new poet uncouth unkissd say the old famous poet chaucer whom for hi excellency and wonderful skill in make hi scholar lidgate a worthy scholar of so excellent a maister calleth the loadstar of our language and whom our colin clout in hi ï¿½glogue calleth tityrus the god of shepheards compare him to the worthiness of the roman tityrus virgil which proverb mine own good friend m harvey a in that good old poet it serve well pandar purpose for the bolstering of hi bawdy brocage so very well taketh place in this our new poet who for that he be uncouth a say chaucer be unkissd and unknown to most men be regard but of a few but i doubt not so soon a hi name shall come into the knowledge of men and hi worthiness be sound in the trump of fame but that he shall be not only kissd but also beloved of all embrace of the most and wonderd at of the best no less i think deserveth hi wittiness in devise hi pithiness in utter hi complaint of love so lovely hi discourse of pleasure so pleasantly hi pastoral rudeness hi moral wiseness hi due observing of decorum every where in personage in season in matter in speech and generally in all seemly simplicity of handle hi matter and frame hi word the which of many thing which in him be strange i know will seem the strange and word themselves be so ancient the knitting of them so short and intricate and the whole period and compass of speech so delightsome for the roundness and so grave for the strangeness and first of the word to speak i grant they be something hard and of most men unused yet both englishand also use of most excellent author and most famous poet in whom when a this our poet hath be much travail and throughly read how could it be a that worthy orator say but that walk in the sun although for other cause he walk yet need he must be sunburnt and have the sound of those ancient poet still ring in hi ear he must need in sing hit out some of their tune but whether he useth them by such casualty and custom or of set purpose and choice a think them fit for such rustic rudeness of shepheards either for that their rough sound would make hi rhyme more ragged and rustic or els because such old and obsolete word be most used of country folk sure i think and think i think not amiss that they bring great grace and a one would say authority to the verse for alb amongst many other fault it specially be object of valla against livy and of other against sallust that with over much study they affect antiquity a cover thereby credence and honour of elder year yet i be of opinion and eke the best learn be of the like that those ancient solemn word be a great ornament both in the one and in the other the one labouring to set forth in hi work an eternal image of antiquity and the other carefully discourse matter of gravity and importance for if my memory fail not tully in that book wherein he endeavoureth to set forth the pattern of a perfect orator saith that ofttimes an ancient word maketh the style seem grave and a it be reverend no otherwise than we honour and reverence gray hair for a certain religious regard which we have of old age yet neither every where must old word be stuff in nor the common dialect and manner of speak so corrupted thereby that a in old building it seem disorderly and ruinous but all a in most exquisite picture they use to blaze and pourtray not only the dainty lineament of beauty but also round about it to shadow the rude thicket and craggy clifts that by the baseness of such part more excellency may accrue to the principal for oftentimes we find ourselves i know not how singularly delight with the shew of such natural rudeness and take great pleasure in that disorderly order even so do those rough and harsh term enlumine and make more clearly to appear the brightness of brave and glorious word so oftentimes a discord in music maketh a comely concordance so great delight take the worthy poet alceus to behold a blemish in the joint of a wellshaped body but if any will rashly blame such hi purpose in choice of old and unwonted word him may i more justly blame and condemn or of witless headiness in judge or of heedless hardiness in condemn for not mark the compass of hi bent he will judge of the length of hi cast for in my opinion it be one especial praise of many which be due to this poet that he hath labour to restore a to their rightful heritage such good and natural english
