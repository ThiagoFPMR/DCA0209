when king arthur have after long war rest and hold a royal feast and table round with hi ally of king prince and noble knight all of the round table there come into hi hall he sit in hi throne royal twelve ancient men bear each of them a branch of olive in token that they come a ambassador and messenger from the emperor lucius which be call at that time dictator or procuror of the public weal of rome which say messenger after their entering and come into the presence of king arthur do to him their obeisance in make to him reverence and say to him in this wise the high and mighty emperor lucius sendeth to the king of britain greet command thee to acknowledge him for thy lord and to send him the truage due of this realm unto the empire which thy father and other tofore thy precessors

shall be ensample perpetual unto all king and prince for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which domineth upon the universal world then when they have show the effect of their message the king command them to withdraw them and say he should take advice of council and give to them an answer then some of the young knight hear this their message would have run on them to have slay them say that it be a rebuke to all the knight there be present to suffer them to say so to the king and anon the king command that none of them upon pain of death to missay them nor do them any harm and command a knight to bring them to their lodging and see that they have all that be necessary and requisite for them with the best cheer and that no dainty be spar for the roman be great lord and though their message please me not nor my court yet i must remember mine honour after this the king let call all hi lord and knight of the round table to counsel upon this matter and desire them to say their advice then sir cador of cornwall spake first and say sir this message liketh me well for we have many day rest u and have be idle and now i hope ye shall make sharp war on the roman where i doubt not we shall get honour i believe well say arthur that this matter pleaseth thee well but these answer may not be answer for the demand grieveth me sore for truly i will never pay truage to rome wherefore i pray you to counsel me i have understand that belinus and brenius king of britain have have the empire in their hand many day and also constantine the son of heleine which be an open evidence that we owe no tribute to rome but of right we that be descend of them have right to claim the title of the empire then answer king anguish of scotland sir ye ought of right to be above all other king for unto you be none like nor pareil in christendom of knighthood nor of dignity and i counsel you never to obey the roman for when they reign on u they distress our elder and put this land to great extortion and tally wherefore i make here mine avow to avenge me on them and for to strengthen your quarrel i shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war and wage them on my cost which shall await on you with myself when it shall please you and the king of little britain grant him to the same thirty thousand wherefore king arthur thank them and then every man agree to make war and

with all other promise in likewise every man a great multitude and when king arthur understand their courage and good will he thank them heartily and after let call the ambassador to hear their answer and in presence of all hi lord and knight he say to them in this wise i will that ye return unto your lord and procuror of the common weal for the roman and say ye to him of hi demand and commandment i set nothing and that i know of no truage nor tribute that i owe to him nor to none earthly prince christian nor heathen but i pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire wherein i be entitle by the right of my predecessor sometime king of this land and say to him that i be delibered and fully conclude to go with mine army with strength and power unto rome by the grace of god to take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel wherefore i command him and all them of rome that incontinent they make to me their homage and to acknowledge me for their emperor and governor upon pain that shall ensue and then he command hi treasurer to give to them great and large gift and to pay all their dispenses and assign sir cador to convey them out of the land and so they take their leave and departed and take their shipping at sandwich and pass forth by flanders almaine the mountain and all italy until they come unto lucius and after the reverence make they make relation of their answer like a ye tofore have hear when the emperor lucius have well understand their credence he be sore move a he have be all araged and say i have suppose that arthur would have obey to my commandment and have serve you himself a him well beseem or any other king to do o sir say one of the senator let be such vain word for we let you wit that i and my fellow be full sore afeard to behold hi countenance i fear me ye have make a rod for yourself for he intendeth to be lord of this empire which sore be to be doubt if he come for he be all another man than ye ween and

most manly man that liveth and be like to conquer all the world for unto hi courage it be too little wherefore i advise you to keep well your march and strait in the mountain for certainly he be a lord to be doubt well say lucius before easter i suppose to pass the mountain and so forth into france and there bereave him hi land with genoese and other mighty warrior of tuscany and lombardy and i shall send for them all that be subject and ally to the empire of rome to come to mine aid and forthwith sent old wise knight unto these country follow first to ambage and arrage to alexandria to

come down the mountain for to destroy the land that arthur have conquer and come unto cologne and besiege a castle thereby and win it soon and stuff it with two hundred saracen or infidel and after destroy many fair country which arthur have win of king claudas and thus lucius come with all hi host which be disperplyd sixty mile in breadth and command them to meet with him in burgoyne for he purpose to destroy the realm of little britain now leave we of lucius the emperor and speak we of king arthur that command all them of hi retinue to be ready at the uta of hilary for to hold a

which after the death of arthur be king of this realm and in the presence of all hi lord he resign the rule of the realm and guenever hi queen to them wherefore sir launcelot be wroth for he leave sir tristram with king mark for the love of beale isould then the queen guenever make great sorrow for the departing of her lord and other and swoon in such wise that the lady bare her into her chamber thus the king with hi great army depart leave the queen and realm in the governance of sir baudwin and constantine and when he be on hi horse he say with an high voice if i die in this journey i will that sir constantine be mine heir and king crown of this realm a next of my blood and after depart and enter into the sea at sandwich with all hi army with a great multitude of ship galley cog and
