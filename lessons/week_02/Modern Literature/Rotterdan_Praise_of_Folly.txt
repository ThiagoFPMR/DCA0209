the praise of folly an oration of feigned matter speak by folly in her own person at what rate soever the world talk of me for i be not ignorant what an ill report folly have get even among the most foolish yet that i be that she that only she whose deity recreate both god and men even this be a sufficient argument that i no sooner step up to speak to this full assembly than all your face put on a kind of new and unwonted pleasantness so suddenly have you clear your brow and with so frolic and hearty a laughter give me your applause that in truth a many of you a i behold on every side of me seem to me no less than homer god drink with nectar and nepenthe whereas before you sit a lumpish and pensive a if you have come from consult an oracle and a it usually happen when the sun begin to show hi beam or when after a sharp winter the spring breathes afresh on the earth all thing immediately get a new face new color and recover a it be a certain kind of youth again in like manner by but behold me you have in an instant gotten another kind of countenance and so what the otherwise great rhetorician with their tedious and longstudied oration can hardly effect to wit to remove the trouble of the mind i have do it at once with my single look but if you ask me why i appear before you in this strange dress be please to lend me your ear and ill tell you not those ear i mean you carry to church but abroad with you such a you be wont to prick up to juggler fool and buffoon and such a our friend midas once give to pan for i be disposed awhile to play the sophist with you not of their sort who nowadays boozle young men head with certain empty notion and curious trifle yet teach them nothing but a more than womanish obstinacy of scold but ill imitate those ancient who that they might the good avoid that infamous appellation of sophi or wise chose rather to be call sophist their business be to celebrate the praise of the god and valiant men and the like encomium shall you hear from me but neither of hercules nor solon but my own dear self that be to say folly nor do i esteem a rush that call it a foolish and insolent thing to praise one self be it as foolish a they would make it so they confess it proper and what can be more than that folly be her own trumpet for who can set me out good than myself unless perhaps i could be good know to another than to myself though yet i think it somewhat more modest than the general practice of our noble and wise men who throw away all shame hire some flattering orator or lie poet from whose mouth they may hear their praise that be to say mere lie and yet compose themselves with a seem modesty spread out their peacock plume and erect their crest while this impudent flatterer equal a man of nothing to the god and propose him a an absolute pattern of all virtue thats wholly a stranger to it set out a pitiful jay in other feather wash the blackamoor white and lastly swell a gnat to an elephant in short i will follow that old proverb that say he may lawfully praise himself that live far from neighbor though by the way i can not but wonder at the ingratitude shall i say or negligence of men who notwithstanding they honor me in the first place and be willing enough to confess my bounty yet not one of them for these so many age have there be who in some thankful oration have set out the praise of folly when yet there have not want them whose elaborate endeavor have extol tyrant ague fly baldness and such other pest of nature to their own loss of both time and sleep and now you shall hear from me a plain extemporary speech but so much the truer nor would i have you think it like the rest of orator make for the ostentation of wit for these a you know when they have be beat their head some thirty year about an oration and at last perhaps produce somewhat that be never their own shall yet swear they compose it in three day and that too for diversion whereas i ever like it best to speak whatever come first out but let none of you expect from me that after the manner of rhetorician i should go about to define what i be much less use any division for i hold it equally unlucky to circumscribe her whose deity be universal or make the least division in that worship about which everything be so generally agree or to what purpose think you should i describe myself when i be here present before you and you behold me speak for i be a you see that true and only giver of wealth whom the greek call moria the latin stultitia and our plain english folly or what need be there to have say so much a if my very look be not sufficient to inform you who i be or a if any man mistake me for wisdom could not at first sight convince himself by my face the true index of my mind i be no counterfeit nor do i carry one thing in my look and another in my breast no i be in every respect so like myself that neither can they dissemble me who arrogate to themselves the appearance and title of wise men and walk like ass in scarlet hood though after all their hypocrisy midas ear will discover their master a most ungrateful generation of men that when they be wholly give up to my party be yet publicly ashamed of the name a take it for a reproach for which cause since in truth they be morotatoi fool and yet would appear to the world to be wise men and thales well even call them morosoph wise fool nor will it be amiss also to imitate the rhetorician of our time who think themselves in a manner god if like horse leech they can but appear to be doubletongued and believe they have do a mighty act if in their latin oration they can but shuffle in some end of greek like mosaic work though altogether by head and shoulder and less to the purpose and if they want hard word they run over some wormeaten manuscript and pick out half a dozen of the most old and obsolete to confound their reader believe no doubt that they that understand their meaning will like it the good and they that do not will admire it the more by how much the less they understand it nor be this way of ours of admire what seem most foreign without it particular grace for if there happen to be any more ambitious than other they may give their applause with a smile and like the as shake their ear that they may be think to understand more than the rest of their neighbor but to come to the purpose i have give you my name but what epithet shall i add what but that of the most foolish for by what more proper name can so great a goddess a folly be know to her disciple and because it be not alike know to all from what stock i be sprung with the mus good leave ill do my endeavor to satisfy you but yet neither the first chaos orcus saturn or japhet nor any of those threadbare musty god be my father but plutus rich that only he that be in spite of hesiod homer nay and jupiter himself divum pater atque hominum rex the father of god and men at whose single beck a heretofore so at present all thing sacred and profane be turn topsyturvy accord to whose pleasure war peace empire counsel judgment assembly wedlocks bargain league law arts all thing light or seriousi want breathin short all the public and private business of mankind be govern without whose help all that herd of god of the poet make and those few of the good sort of the rest either would not be at all or if they be they would be but such a live at home and keep a poor house to themselves and to whomsoever he an enemy ti not pallas herself that can befriend him a on the contrary he whom he favor may lead jupiter and hi thunder in a string this be my father and in him i glory nor do he produce me from hi brain a jupiter that sour and illlooked pallas but of that lovely nymph call youth the most beautiful and galliard of all the rest nor be i like that limp blacksmith begot in the sad and irksome bond of matrimony yet mistake me not twas not that blind and decrepit plutus in aristophanes that get me but such a he be in hi full strength and pride of youth and not that only but at such a time when he have be well heat with nectar of which he have at one of the banquet of the god take a dose extraordinary and a to the place of my birth forasmuch a nowadays that be look upon a a main point of nobility it be neither like apollo in the floating delos nor venuslike on the roll sea nor in any of blind homer a blind cave but in the fortunate island where all thing grow without plow or sow where neither labor nor old age nor disease be ever hear of and in whose field neither daffodil mallow onion bean and such contemptible thing would ever grow but on the contrary rue angelica bugloss marjoram trefoil roses violet lily and all the garden of adonis invite both your sight and your smelling and be thus bear i do not begin the world a other child be wont with cry but straight perch up and smile on my mother nor do i envy to the great jupiter the goat hi nurse forasmuch a i be suckle by two jolly nymphs to wit drunkenness the daughter of bacchus and ignorance of pan and a for such my companion and follower a you perceive about me if you have a mind to know who they be you be not like to be the wiser for me unless it be in greek this here which you observe with that proud cast of her eye be philautia selflove she with the smile countenance that be ever and anon clap her hand be kolakia flattery she that look a if she be half asleep be lethe oblivion she that sit lean on both elbow with her hand clutch together be misoponia laziness she with the garland on her head and that smell so strong of perfume be hedone pleasure she with those star eye move here and there be anoia madness she with the smooth skin and full pamper body be tryphe wantonness and a to the two god that you see with them the one be komos intemperance the other negretos hypnos dead sleep these i say be my household servant and by their faithful counsel i have subject all thing to my dominion and erect an empire over emperor themselves thus have you have my lineage education and companion and now l i may seem to have take upon me the name of goddess without cause you shall in the next place understand how far my deity extend and what advantage by it i have bring both to god and men for if it be not unwisely say by somebody that this only be to be a god to help men and if they be deservedly enrol among the god that first bring in corn and wine and such other thing a be for the common good of mankind why be not i of right the alpha or first of all the god who be but one yet bestow all thing on all men for first what be more sweet or more precious than life and yet from whom can it more properly be say to come than from me for neither the crabfavoured pallas spear nor the cloudgathering jupiter shield either beget or propagate mankind but even he himself the father of god and king of men at whose very beck the heaven shake must lay by hi forked thunder and those look wherewith he conquer the giant and with which at pleasure he frighten the rest of the god and like a common stage player put on a disguise as often a he go about that which now and then he do that be to say the get of child and the stoic too that conceive themselves next to the god yet show me one of them nay the veriest bigot of the sect and if he do not put off hi beard the badge of wisdom though yet it be no more than what be common with him and goat yet at least he must lay by hi supercilious gravity smooth hi forehead shake off hi rigid principle and for some time commit an act of folly and dotage in fine that wise man whoever he be if he intend to have child must have recourse to me but tell me i beseech you what man be that would submit hi neck to the noose of wedlock if a wise men should he do but first truly weigh the inconvenience of the thing or what woman be there would ever go to it do she seriously consider either the peril of childbearing or the trouble of bring them up so then if you owe your being to wedlock you owe that wedlock to this my follower madness and what you owe to me i have already tell you again she that have but once try what it be would she do you think make a second venture if it be not for my other companion oblivion nay even venus herself notwithstanding whatever lucretius have say would not deny but that all her virtue be lame and fruitless without the help of my deity for out of that little odd ridiculous maygame come the supercilious philosopher in whose room have succeed a kind of people the world call monk cardinal priest and the most holy pope and lastly all that rabble of the poet god with which heaven be so thwacked and throng that though it be of so vast an extent they be hardly able to crowd one by another but i think it be a small matter that you thus owe your beginning of life to me unless i also show you that whatever benefit you receive in the progress of it be of my gift likewise for what other be this can that be call life where you take away pleasure oh do you like what i say i know none of you could have so little wit or so much folly or wisdom rather a to be of any other opinion for even the stoic themselves that so severely cry down pleasure do but handsomely dissemble and rail against it to the common people to no other end but that have discourage them from it they might the more plentifully enjoy it themselves but tell me by jupiter what part of man life be that that be not sad crab unpleasant insipid troublesome unless it be season with pleasure that be to say folly for the proof of which the never sufficiently praise sophocles in that hi happy elegy of u to know nothing be the only happiness might be authority enough but that i intend to take every particular by itself and first who know not but a mans infancy be the merry part of life to himself and most acceptable to other for what be that in them which we kiss embrace cherish nay enemy succor but this witchcraft of folly which wise nature do of purpose give them into the world with them that they might the more pleasantly pas over the toil of education and a it be flatter the care and diligence of their nurse and then for youth which be in such reputation everywhere how do all men favor it study to advance it and lend it their help hand and whence i pray all this grace whence but from me by whose kindness a it understand as little a may be it be also for that reason the high privilege from exception and i be mistaken if when it be grow up and by experience and discipline bring to savor something like man if in the same instant that beauty do not fade it liveliness decay it pleasantness grow flat and it briskness fail and by how much the further it run from me by so much the less it live till it come to the burden of old age not only hateful to other but to itself also which also be altogether insupportable do not i pity it condition in be present with it and a the poet god be wont to assist such a be die with some pleasant metamorphosis help their decrepit as much a in me lie by bring them back to a second childhood from whence they be not improperly call twice child which if you ask me how i do it i shall not be shy in the point i bring them to our river lethe for it springhead rise in the fortunate island and that other of hell be but a brook in comparison from which as soon a they have drink down a long forgetfulness they wash away by degree the perplexity of their mind and so wax young again but perhaps youll say they be foolish and dot admit it tis the very essence of childhood a if to be such be not to be a fool or that that condition have anything pleasant in it but that it understand nothing for who would not look upon that child a a prodigy that should have as much wisdom a a manaccording to that common proverb i do not like a child that be a man too soon or who would endure a converse or friendship with that old man who to so large an experience of thing have join an equal strength of mind and sharpness of judgment and therefore for this reason it be that old age dotes and that it do so it be behold to me yet notwithstanding be this dotard exempt from all those care that distract a wise man he be not the less pot companion nor be he sensible of that burden of life which the more manly age find enough to do to stand upright under it and sometimes too like plautus old man he return to hi three letter amo the most unhappy of all thing live if he rightly understand what he do in it and yet so much do i befriend him that i make him well receive of hi friend and no unpleasant companion for as much a accord to homer nestor discourse be pleasant than honey whereas achilles be both bitter and malicious and that of old men a he have it in another place florid in which respect also they have this advantage of child in that they want the only pleasure of the other life well suppose it prattle add to this that old men be more eagerly delight with child and they again with old men like to like quote the devil to the collier for what difference between them but that the one have more wrinkle and year upon hi head than the other otherwise the brightness of their hair toothless mouth weakness of body love of mild broken speech chat toy forgetfulness inadvertency and briefly all other their action agree in everything and by how much the nearer they approach to this old age by so much they grow backward into the likeness of child until like them they pass from life to death without any weariness of the one or sense of the other and now let him that will compare the benefit they receive by me the metamorphosis of the god of whom i shall not mention what they have do in their pettish humor but where they have be most favorable turn one into a tree another into a bird a third into a grasshopper serpent or the like a if there be any difference between perish and be another thing but i restore the same man to the best and happy part of hi life and if men would but refrain from all commerce with wisdom and give up themselves to be govern by me they should never know what it be to be old but solace themselves with a perpetual youth do but observe our grim philosopher that be perpetually beat their brain on knotty subject and for the most part youll find them grown old before they be scarcely young and whence be it but that their continual and restless thought insensibly prey upon their spirit and dry up their radical moisture whereas on the contrary my fat fool be a plump and round a a westphalian hog and never sensible of old age unless perhaps a sometimes it rarely happen they come to be infect with wisdom so hard a thing it be for a man to be happy in all thing and to this purpose be that no small testimony of the proverb that say folly be the only thing that keep youth at a stay and old age afar off a it be verify in the brabanders of whom there go this common say that age which be wont to render other men wiser make them the great fool and yet there be scarce any nation of a more jocund converse or that be less sensible of the misery of old age than they be and to these a in situation so for manner of live come near my friends the hollander and why should i not call them mine since they be so diligent observer of me that they be commonly call by my nameof which they be so far from be ashamed they rather pride themselves in it let the foolish world then be pack and seek out medea circe venus aurora and i know not what other fountain of restore youth i be sure i be the only person that both can and have make it good ti i alone that have that wonderful juice with which memnons daughter prolong the youth of her grandfather tithon i be that venus by whose favor phaon become so young again that sappho fell in love with him mine be those herb if yet there be any such mine those charm and mine that fountain that not only restore depart youth but which be more desirable preserve it perpetual and if you all subscribe to this opinion that nothing be good than youth or more execrable than age i conceive you can not but see how much you be indebted to me that have retain so great a good and shut out so great an evil but why do i altogether spend my breath in speaking of mortal view heaven round and let him that will reproach me with my name if he find any one of the god that be not stink and contemptible be he not make acceptable by my deity why be it that bacchus be always a stripling and bushyhaired but because he be mad and drunk and spend hi life in drink dance revel and may game not have so much a the least society with pallas and lastly he be so far from desire to be account wise that he delight to be worship with sport and gambol nor be he displease with the proverb that give him the surname of fool a great fool than bacchus which name of hi be change to morychus for that sit before the gate of hi temple the wanton country people be wont to bedaub him with new wine and fig and of scoff what not have not the ancient comedy throw on him o foolish god say they and worthy to be bear a you be of your father thigh and yet who have not rather be your fool and sot always merry ever young and make sport for other people than either homer jupiter with hi crooked counsel terrible to everyone or old pan with hi hubbub or smutty vulcan half cover with cinder or even pallas herself so dreadful with her gorgon head and spear and a countenance like bullbeef why be cupid always portray like a boy but because he be a very wag and can neither do nor so much a think of anything sober why venus ever in her prime but because of her affinity with me witness that color of her hair so resemble my father from whence she be call the golden venus and lastly ever laugh if you give any credit to the poet or their follower the statuary what deity do the roman ever more religiously adore than that of flora the foundress of all pleasure nay if you should but diligently search the life of the most sour and morose of the god out of homer and the rest of the poet you would find them all but so many piece of folly and to what purpose should i run over any of the other god trick when you know enough of jupiter loose love when that chaste diana shall so far forget her sex a to be ever hunt and ready to perish for endymion but i have rather they should hear these thing from momus from whom heretofore they be wont to have their share till in one of their angry humor they tumble him together with ate goddess of mischief down headlong to the earth because hi wisdom forsooth unseasonably disturb their happiness nor since that dare any mortal give him harbor though i must confess there wanted little but that he have be receive into the court of prince have not my companion flattery reign in chief there with whom and the other there be no more correspondence than between lamb and wolf from whence it be that the god play the fool with the great liberty and more content to themselves do all thing carelessly a say father homer that be to say without anyone to correct them for what ridiculous stuff be there which that stump of the fig tree priapus do not afford them what trick and legerdemain with which mercury do not cloak hi theft what buffoonery that vulcan be not guilty of while one with hi poltfoot another with hi smutched muzzle another with hi impertinencies he make sport for the rest of the god a also that old silenus with hi country dance polyphemus footing time to hi cyclops hammer the nymph with their jig and satyr with their antic while pan make them all twitter with some coarse ballad which yet they have rather hear than the mus themselves and chiefly when they be well whittle with nectar besides what should i mention what these god do when they be half drunk now by my troth so foolish that i myself can hardly refrain laughter but in these matter twere well we remember harpocrates l some eavesdropping god or other take u whisper that which momus only have the privilege of speaking at length and therefore accord to homer example i think it high time to leave the god to themselves and look down a little on the earth wherein likewise youll find nothing frolic or fortunate that it owe not to me so provident have that great parent of mankind nature be that there should not be anything without it mixture and a it be season of folly for since accord to the definition of the stoic wisdom be nothing els than to be govern by reason and on the contrary folly to be give up to the will of our passion that the life of man might not be altogether disconsolate and hard to away with of how much more passion than reason have jupiter compose u put in a one would say scarce half an ounce to a pound besides he have confine reason to a narrow corner of the brain and leave all the rest of the body to our passion have also set up against this one two a it be masterless tyrantsanger that possess the region of the heart and consequently the very fountain of life the heart itself and lust that stretch it empire everywhere against which double force how powerful reason be let common experience declare inasmuch a she which yet be all she can do may call out to u till she be hoarse again and tell u the rule of honesty and virtue while they give up the rein to their governor and make a hideous clamor till at last be weary he suffer himself to be carry whither they please to hurry him but forasmuch as such a be bear to the business of the world have some little sprinkling of reason more than the rest yet that they may the good manage it even in this as well a in other thing they call me to counsel and i give them such a be worthy of myself to wit that they take to them a wifea silly thing god wot and foolish yet wanton and pleasant by which mean the roughness of the masculine temper be season and sweeten by her folly for in that plato seem to doubt under what genus he should put woman to wit that of rational creature or brutes he intend no other in it than to show the apparent folly of the sex for if perhaps any of them go about to be think wise than the rest what els do she do but play the fool twice a if a man should teach a cow to dance a thing quite against the hair for a it double the crime if anyone should put a disguise upon nature or endeavor to bring her to that she will in no wise bear accord to that proverb of the greek an ape be an ape though clad in scarlet so a woman be a woman still that be to say foolish let her put on whatever vizard she please but by the way i hope that sex be not so foolish a to take offense at this that i myself be a woman and folly too have attribute folly to them for if they weigh it right they need must acknowledge that they owe it to folly that they be more fortunate than men a first their beauty which and that not without cause they prefer before everything since by it mean they exercise a tyranny even upon tyrant themselves otherwise whence proceeds that sour look rough skin bushy beard and such other thing a speak plain old age in a man but from that disease of wisdom whereas womens cheek be ever plump and smooth their voice small their skin soft a if they imitate a certain kind of perpetual youth again what great thing do they wish in their whole life than that they may please the man for to what other purpose be all those dress wash baths slop perfume and those several little trick of set their face paint their eyebrow and smooth their skin and now tell me what high letter of recommendation have they to men than this folly for what be it they do not permit them to do and to what other purpose than that of pleasure wherein yet their folly be not the least thing that please which so true it be i think no one will deny that do but consider with himself what foolish discourse and odd gambol pass between a man and hi woman as often a he have a mind to be gamesome and so i have show you whence the first and chief delight of man life spring but there be some youll say and those too none of the young that have a great kindness for the pot than the petticoat and place their chief pleasure in good fellowship if there can be any great entertainment without a woman at it let other look to it this i be sure there be never any pleasant which folly give not the relish to insomuch that if they find no occasion of laughter they send for one that may make it or hire some buffoon flatterer whose ridiculous discourse may put by the gravity of the company for to what purpose be it to clog our stomach with dainty junket and the like stuff unless our eye and ear nay whole mind be likewise entertain with jest merriment and laughter but of these kind of second course i be the only cook though yet those ordinary practice of our feast a choose a king throwing dice drink health troll it round dance the cushion and the like be not invent by the seven wise men but myself and that too for the common pleasure of mankind the nature of all which thing be such that the more of folly they have the more they conduce to human life which if it be unpleasant do not deserve the name of life and other than such it could not well be do not these kind of diversion wipe away tediousness next cousin to the other but perhaps there be some that neglect this way of pleasure and rest satisfy in the enjoyment of their friend call friendship the most desirable of all thing more necessary than either air fire or water so delectable that he that shall take it out of the world have a good put out the sun and lastly so commendable if yet that make anything to the matter that neither the philosopher themselves doubt to reckon it among their chief good but what if i show you that i be both the beginning and end of this so great good also nor shall i go about to prove it by fallacy sorites dilemmas or other the like subtlety of logician but after my blunt way point out the thing as clearly a it be with my finger and now tell me if to wink slip over be blind at or deceive in the vice of our friend nay to admire and esteem them for virtue be not at least the next degree to folly what be it when one kiss hi mistress freckle neck another the wart on her nose when a father shall swear hi squinteyed child be more lovely than venus what be this i say but mere folly and so perhaps youll cry it be and yet tis this only that join friends together and continue them so join i speak of ordinary men of whom none be bear without their imperfection and happy be he that be press with the least for among wise prince there be either no friendship at all or if there be ti unpleasant and reserve and that too but among a very few twere a crime to say none for that the great part of mankind be fools nay there be not anyone that dot not in many thing and friendship you know be seldom make but among equal and yet if it should so happen that there be a mutual good will between them it be in no wise firm nor very long live that be to say among such a be morose and more circumspect than need a be eaglesighted into hi friend fault but so bleareyed to their own that they take not the least notice of the wallet that hang behind their own shoulder since then the nature of man be such that there be scarce anyone to be find that be not subject to many error add to this the great diversity of mind and study so many slip oversight and chance of human life and how be it possible there should be any true friendship between those argus so much a one hour be it not for that which the greek excellently call euetheian and you may render by folly or good nature choose you whether but what be not the author and parent of all our love cupid as blind a a beetle and a with him all color agree so from him be it that everyone like hi own sweeterkin best though never so ugly and that an old man dot on hi old wife and a boy on hi girl these thing be not only do everywhere but laugh at too yet as ridiculous a they be they make society pleasant and a it be glue it together and what have be say of friendship may more reasonably be presume of matrimony which in truth be no other than an inseparable conjunction of life good god what divorce or what not bad than that would daily happen be not the converse between a man and hi wife support and cherish by flattery apish gentleness ignorance dissemble certain retainer of mine also whoop holiday how few marriage should we have if the husband should but thoroughly examine how many trick hi pretty little mop of modesty have play before she be marry and how few of them would hold together do not most of the wifes action escape the husband knowledge through hi neglect or sottishness and for this also you be beholden to me by whose mean it be that the husband be pleasant to hi wife the wife to her husband and the house keep in quiet a man be laugh at when see hi wife weep he lick up her tear but how much happy be it to be thus deceive than by be trouble with jealousy not only to torment himself but set all thing in a hubbub in fine i be so necessary to the making of all society and manner of life both delightful and lasting that neither would the people long endure their governor nor the servant hi master nor the master hi footman nor the scholar hi tutor nor one friend another nor the wife her husband nor the usurer the borrower nor a soldier hi commander nor one companion another unless all of them have their interchangeable failing one while flatter other while prudently connive and generally sweeten one another with some small relish of folly and now youd think i have say all but you shall hear yet great thing will he i pray love anyone that hat himself or ever agree with another who be not at peace with himself or beget pleasure in another that be troublesome to himself i think no one will say it that be not more foolish than folly and yet if you should exclude me theres no man but would be so far from endure another that he would stink in hi own nostril be nauseate with hi own action and himself become odious to himself forasmuch a nature in too many thing rather a stepdame than a parent to u have imprint that evil in men especially such a have least judgment that everyone repent him of hi own condition and admire that of other whence it come to pass that all her gift elegancy and grace corrupt and perish for what benefit be beauty the great blessing of heaven if it be mix with affectation what youth if corrupt with the severity of old age lastly what be that in the whole business of a mans life he can do with any grace to himself or othersfor it be not so much a thing of art a the very life of every action that it be do with a good mienunless this my friend and companion selflove be present with it nor do she without cause supply me the place of a sister since her whole endeavor be to act my part everywhere for what be more foolish than for a man to study nothing els than how to please himself to make himself the object of hi own admiration and yet what be there that be either delightful or take nay rather what not the contrary that a man do against the hair take away this salt of life and the orator may even sit still with hi action the musician with all hi division will be able to please no man the player be hiss off the stage the poet and all hi mus ridiculous the painter with hi art contemptible and the physician with all hi slipslops go abegging lastly you will be take for an ugly fellow instead of youthful and a beast instead of a wise man a child instead of eloquent and instead of a wellbred man a clown so necessary a thing it be that everyone flatter himself and commend himself to himself before he can be commend by other lastly since it be the chief point of happiness that a man be willing to be what he be you have far abridge in this my selflove that no man be ashamed of hi own face no man of hi own wit no man of hi own parentage no man of hi own house no man of hi manner of live nor any man of hi own country so that a highlander have no desire to change with an italian a thracian with an athenian nor a scythian for the fortunate island o the singular care of nature that in so great a variety of thing have make all equal where she have be sometimes spar of her gift she have recompense it with the more of selflove though here i must confess i speak foolishly it be the great of all other her gift to say nothing that no great action be ever attempt without my motion or art bring to perfection without my help be not war the very root and matter of all famed enterprise and yet what more foolish than to undertake it for i know what trifle especially when both party be sure to lose more than they get by the bargain for of those that be slay not a word of them and for the rest when both side be close engage and the trumpet make an ugly noise what use of those wise men i pray that be so exhausted with study that their thin cold blood have scarce any spirit leave no it must be those blunt fat fellow that by how much the more they exceed in courage fall short in understand unless perhaps one have rather choose demosthenes for a soldier who follow the example of archilochius throw away hi arm and betook him to hi heel eer he have scarce see hi enemy a ill a soldier a happy an orator but counsel youll say be not of least concern in matter of war in a general i grant it but this thing of war be not part of philosophy but manage by parasite pander thief cutthroat plowmen sots spendthrift and such other dreg of mankind not philosopher who how unapt they be even for common converse let socrates whom the oracle of apollo though not so wisely judge the wise of all men live be witness who step up to speak somewhat i know not what in public be force to come down again well laugh at for hi pain though yet in this he be not altogether a fool that he refuse the appellation of wise and return it back to the oracle deliver hi opinion that a wise man should abstain from meddle with public business unless perhaps he should have rather admonish u to beware of wisdom if we intend to be reckon among the number of men there be nothing but hi wisdom that first accuse and afterwards sentence him to the drinking of hi poisoned cup for while a you find him in aristophanes philosophize about cloud and idea measure how far a flea could leap and admire that so small a creature a a fly should make so great a buzz he meddle not with anything that concern common life but hi master be in danger of hi head hi scholar plato be at hand to wit that famous patron that be disturb with the noise of the people could not go through half hi first sentence what should i speak of theophrastus who be about to make an oration become as dumb a if he have meet a wolf in hi way which yet would have put courage in a man of war or isocrates that be so cowhearted that he dare never attempt it or tully that great founder of the roman eloquence that could never begin to speak without an odd kind of tremble like a boy that have get the hiccough which fabius interpret a an argument of a wise orator and one that be sensible of what he be do and while he say it do he not plainly confess that wisdom be a great obstacle to the true management of business what would become of them think you be they to fight it out at blow that be so dead through fear when the contest be only with empty word and next to these be cry up forsooth that goodly sentence of plato happy be that commonwealth where a philosopher be prince or whose prince be addict to philosophy when yet if you consult historian youll find no prince more pestilent to the commonwealth than where the empire have fall to some smatter in philosophy or one give to letter to the truth of which i think the catoes give sufficient credit of whom the one be ever disturb the peace of the commonwealth with hi hairbrained accusation the other while he too wisely vindicate it liberty quite overthrow it add to this the bruti casii nay cicero himself that be no less pernicious to the commonwealth of rome than be demosthenes to that of athens besides m antoninus that i may give you one instance that there be once one good emperor for with much ado i can make it out be become burdensome and hat of hi subject upon no other score but that he be so great a philosopher but admit him good he do the commonwealth more hurt in leave behind him such a son a he do than ever he do it good by hi own government for these kind of men that be so give up to the study of wisdom be generally most unfortunate but chiefly in their child nature it seem so providently order it l this mischief of wisdom should spread far among mankind for which reason it be manifest why cicero son be so degenerate and that wise socrates child a one have well observe be more like their mother than their father that be to say fool however this be to be bear with if only a to public employment they be like a sow upon a pair of organ be they anything more apt to discharge even the common office of life invite a wise man to a feast and hell spoil the company either with morose silence or troublesome dispute take him out to dance and youll swear a cow would have do it well bring him to the theatre and hi very look be enough to spoil all till like cato he take an occasion of withdraw rather than put off hi supercilious gravity let him fall into discourse and he shall make more sudden stop than if he have a wolf before him let him buy or sell or in short go about any of those thing without there be no living in this world and youll say this piece of wisdom be rather a stock than a man of so little use be he to himself country or friend and all because he be wholly ignorant of common thing and live a course of life quite different from the people by which mean it be impossible but that he contract a popular odium to wit by reason of the great diversity of their life and souls for what be there at all do among men that be not full of folly and that too from fool and to fool against which universal practice if any single one shall dare to set up hi throat my advice to him be that follow the example of timon he retire into some desert and there enjoy hi wisdom to himself but to return to my design what power be it that draw those stony oaken and wild people into city but flattery for nothing els be signify by amphion and orpheus harp what be it that when the common people of rome be like to have destroy all by their mutiny reduce them to obedience wa it a philosophical oration least but a ridiculous and childish fable of the belly and the rest of the member and as good success have themistocles in hi of the fox and hedgehog what wise man oration could ever have do so much with the people a sertorius invention of hi white hind or hi ridiculous emblem of pull off a horse tail hair by hair or a lycurgus hi example of hi two whelp to say nothing of minos and numa both which rule their foolish multitude with fabulous invention with which kind of toy that great and powerful beast the people be lead anyway again what city ever receive plato or aristotle law or socrates precept but on the contrary what make the decii devote themselves to the infernal god or q curtius to leap into the gulf but an empty vainglory a most bewitching siren and yet tis strange it should be so condemn by those wise philosopher for what be more foolish say they than for a suppliant suitor to flatter the people to buy their favor with gift to court the applause of so many fool to please himself with their acclamation to be carry on the people shoulder a in triumph and have a brazen statue in the marketplace add to this the adoption of name and surname those divine honor give to a man of no reputation and the deification of the most wicked tyrant with public ceremony most foolish thing and such a one democritus be too little to laugh at who deny it and yet from this root spring all the great act of the hero which the pen of so many eloquent men have extol to the sky in a word this folly be that that lay the foundation of city and by it empire authority religion policy and public action be preserve neither be there anything in human life that be not a kind of pastime of folly but to speak of art what set mens wit on work to invent and transmit to posterity so many famous a they conceive piece of learn but the thirst of glory with so much loss of sleep such pain and travail have the most foolish of men think to purchase themselves a kind of i know not what fame than which nothing can be more vain and yet notwithstanding you owe this advantage to folly and which be the most delectable of all other that you reap the benefit of other men madness and now have vindicate to myself the praise of fortitude and industry what think you if i do the same by that of prudence but some will say you may as well join fire and water it may be so but yet i doubt not but to succeed even in this also if a you have do hitherto you will but favor me with your attention and first if prudence depend upon experience to whom be the honor of that name more proper to the wise man who partly out of modesty and partly distrust of himself attempt nothing or the fool whom neither modesty which he never have nor danger which he never considers can discourage from anything the wise man have recourse to the book of the ancient and from thence pick nothing but subtlety of word the fool in undertaking and venture on the business of the world gather if i mistake not the true prudence such a homer though blind may be say to have see when he say the burnt child dread the fire for there be two main obstacle to the knowledge of thing modesty that cast a mist before the understanding and fear that have fancy a danger dissuade u from the attempt but from these folly sufficiently free u and few there be that rightly understand of what great advantage it be to blush at nothing and attempt everything but if you have rather take prudence for that that consist in the judgment of thing hear me i beseech you how far they be from it that yet crack of the name for first ti evident that all human thing like alcibiades sileni or rural god carry a double face but not the least alike so that what at first sight seem to be death if you view it narrowly may prove to be life and so the contrary what appear beautiful may chance to be deform what wealthy a very beggar what infamous praiseworthy what learn a dunce what lusty feeble what jocund sad what noble base what lucky unfortunate what friendly an enemy and what healthful noisome in short view the inside of these sileni and youll find them quite other than what they appear which if perhaps it shall not seem so philosophically spoken ill make it plain to you after my blunt way who would not conceive a prince a great lord and abundant in everything but yet be so illfurnished with the gift of the mind and ever think he shall never have enough he the poor of all men and then for hi mind so give up to vice ti a shame how it enslave him i might in like manner philosophize of the rest but let this one for example sake be enough yet why this will someone say have patience and ill show you what i drive at if anyone see a player act hi part on a stage should go about to strip him of hi disguise and show him to the people in hi true native form would he not think you not only spoil the whole design of the play but deserve himself to be pelt off with stone a a phantastical fool and one out of hi wit but nothing be more common with them than such change the same person one while impersonate a woman and another while a man now a youngster and by and by a grim seignior now a king and presently a peasant now a god and in a trice again an ordinary fellow but to discover this be to spoil all it be the only thing that entertain the eye of the spectator and what be all this life but a kind of comedy wherein men walk up and down in one anothers disguise and act their respective part till the propertyman bring them back to the attiring house and yet he often order a different dress and make him that come but just now off in the robe of a king put on the rag of a beggar thus be all thing represent by counterfeit and yet without this there be no living and here if any wise man a it be drop from heaven should start up and cry this great thing whom the world look upon for a god and i know not what be not so much a a man for that like a beast he be lead by hi passion but the bad of slave inasmuch a he give himself up willingly to so many and such detestable master again if he should bid a man that be bewail the death of hi father to laugh for that he now begin to live by have get an estate without which life be but a kind of death or call another that be boast of hi family ill beget or base because he be so far remove from virtue that be the only fountain of nobility and so of the rest what els would he get by it but be think himself mad and frantic for a nothing be more foolish than preposterous wisdom so nothing be more unadvised than a forward unseasonable prudence and such be hi that do not comply with the present time and order himself a the market go but forget that law of feast either drink or begone undertakes to disprove a common received opinion whereas on the contrary ti the part of a truly prudent man not to be wise beyond hi condition but either to take no notice of what the world do or run with it for company but this be foolish youll say nor shall i deny it provide always you be so civil on the other side a to confess that this be to act a part in that world but o you gods shall i speak or hold my tongue but why should i be silent in a thing that be more true than truth itself however it might not be amiss perhaps in so great an affair to call forth the mus from helicon since the poet so often invoke them upon every foolish occasion be present then awhile and assist me you daughter of jupiter while i make it out that there be no way to that so much famed wisdom nor access to that fortress a they call it of happiness but under the banner of folly and first ti agree of all hand that our passion belong to folly inasmuch a we judge a wise man from a fool by this that the one be order by them the other by reason and therefore the stoic remove from a wise man all disturbance of mind a so many disease but these passion do not only the office of a tutor to such a be make towards the port of wisdom but be in every exercise of virtue a it be spur and incentive nay and encouragers to well do which though that great stoic seneca most strongly denies and take from a wise man all affection whatever yet in do that he leave him not so much a a man but rather a new kind of god that be never yet nor ever like to be nay to speak plainer he set up a stony semblance of a man void of all sense and common feeling of humanity and much good to them with this wise man of theirs let them enjoy him to themselves love him without competitor and live with him in plato commonwealth the country of idea or tantalus orchard for who would not shun and startle at such a man a at some unnatural accident or spirit a man dead to all sense of nature and common affection and no more moved with love or pity than if he be a flint or rock whose censure nothing escape that commit no error himself but have a lynxs eye upon other measure everything by an exact line and forgives nothing please himself with himself only the only rich the only wise the only free man and only king in brief the only man that be everything but in hi own single judgment only that care not for the friendship of any man be himself a friend to no man make no doubt to make the god stoop to him and condemns and laugh at the whole action of our life and yet such a beast be this their perfect wise man but tell me pray if the thing be to be carry by most voice what city would choose him for it governor or what army desire him for their general what woman would have such a husband what goodfellow such a guest or what servant would either wish or endure such a master nay who have not rather have one of the middle sort of fool who be a fool himself may the good know how to command or obey fool and who though he please hi like ti yet the great number one that be kind to hi wife merry among hi friend a boon companion and easy to be live with and lastly one that think nothing of humanity should be a stranger to him but i be weary of this wise man and therefore ill proceed to some other advantage go to then suppose a man in some lofty high tower and that he could look round him a the poet say jupiter be now and then wont to how many misfortune would he find the life of man subject how miserable to say no bad our birth how difficult our education to how many wrong our childhood expose to what pain our youth how unsupportable our old age and grievous our unavoidable death a also what troop of disease beset u how many casualty hang over our head how many trouble invade u and how little there be that be not steep in gall to say nothing of those evil one man bring upon another a poverty imprisonment infamy dishonesty rack snare treachery reproach action deceitsbut im get into a endless a work a number the sandsfor what offenses mankind have deserve these thing or what angry god compel them to be bear into such misery be not my present business yet he that shall diligently examine it with himself would he not think you approve the example of the milesian virgin and kill himself but who be they that for no other reason but that they be weary of life have hasten their own fate were they not the next neighbor to wisdom among whom to say nothing of diogenes xenocrates cato cassius brutus that wise man chiron be offer immortality choose rather to die than be trouble with the same thing always and now i think you see what would become of the world if all men should be wise to wit it be necessary we get another kind of clay and some good potter but i partly through ignorance partly unadvised and sometimes through forgetfulness of evil do now and then so sprinkle pleasure with the hope of good and sweeten men up in their great misfortune that they be not willing to leave this life even then when accord to the account of the destiny this life have leave them and by how much the less reason they have to live by so much the more they desire it so far be they from be sensible of the least wearisomeness of life of my gift it be that you have so many old nestor everywhere that have scarce leave them so much a the shape of a man stutterers dotard toothless grayhaired bald or rather to use the word of aristophanes nasty crumple miserable shriveled bald toothless and want their bauble yet so delighted with life and to be think young that one dye hi gray hair another cover hi baldness with a periwig another get a set of new teeth another fall desperately in love with a young wench and keep more flickering about her than a young man would have be ashamed of for to see such an old crooked piece with one foot in the grave to marry a plump young wench and that too without a portion be so common that men almost expect to be commend for it but the best sport of all be to see our old woman even dead with age and such skeleton one would think they have steal out of their graf and ever mumble in their mouths life be sweet and as old a they be still caterwaul daily plaster their face scarce ever from the glass gossip dance and write love letter these thing be laugh at as foolish a indeed they be yet they please themselves live merrily swim in pleasure and in a word be happy by my courtesy but i would have them to whom these thing seem ridiculous to consider with themselves whether it be not well to live so pleasant a life in such kind of folly than a the proverb go to take a halter and hang themselves besides though these thing may be subject to censure it concern not my fool in the least inasmuch a they take no notice of it or if they do they easily neglect it if a stone fall upon a man head thats evil indeed but dishonesty infamy villainy ill report carry no more hurt in them than a man be sensible of and if a man have no sense of them they be no longer evils what be you the bad if the people hiss at you so you applaud yourself and that a man be able to do so he must owe it to folly but methinks i hear the philosopher oppose it and say ti a miserable thing for a man to be foolish to err mistake and know nothing truly nay rather this be to be a man and why they should call it miserable i see no reason forasmuch a we be so bear so breed so instructed nay such be the common condition of u all and nothing can be call miserable that suit with it kind unless perhaps youll think a man such because he can neither fly with bird nor walk on all four with beast and be not arm with horn a a bull for by the same reason he would call the warlike horse unfortunate because he understand not grammar nor ate cheesecake and the bull miserable because hed make so ill a wrestler and therefore a a horse that have no skill in grammar be not miserable no more be man in this respect for that they agree with hi nature but again the virtuoso may say that there be particularly add to man the knowledge of science by whose help he might recompense himself in understand for what nature cut him short in other thing a if this have the least face of truth that nature that be so solicitously watchful in the production of gnat herb and flower should have so slept when she make man that he should have need to be help by science which that old devil theuth the evil genius of mankind first invent for hi destruction and be so little conducive to happiness that they rather obstruct it to which purpose they be properly say to be first find out a that wise king in plato argue touch the invention of letter science therefore creep into the world with other the pest of mankind from the same head from whence all other mischief spring well suppose it devil for so the name import when you call them demon that be to say know for that simple people of the golden age be wholly ignorant of everything call learning live only by the guidance and dictate of nature for what use of grammar where every man speak the same language and have no further design than to understand one another what use of logic where there be no bicker about the doublemeaning word what need of rhetoric where there be no lawsuit or to what purpose law where there be no ill manner from which without doubt good law first come besides they be more religious than with an impious curiosity to dive into the secret of nature the dimension of star the motion effect and hidden cause of thing a believe it a crime for any man to attempt to be wise beyond hi condition and a to the inquiry of what be beyond heaven that madness never come into their head but the purity of the golden age decline by degree first a i say before art be invent by the evil genius and yet but few and those too receive by few after that the chaldean superstition and greek newfangled that have little to do added i know not how many more mere torment of wit and that so great that even grammar alone be work enough for any man for hi whole life though yet among these science those only be in esteem that come nearest to common sense that be to say folly divine be half starved naturalist out of heart astrologer laugh at and logician slight only the physician be worth all the rest and among them too the more unlearned impudent or unadvised he be the more he be esteem even among prince for physic especially a it be now profess by most men be nothing but a branch of flattery no less than rhetoric next them the second place be give to our lawdrivers if not the first whose profession though i say it myself most men laugh at a the as of philosophy yet theres scarce any business either so great or so small but be manage by these ass these purchase their great lordship while in the meantime the divine have run through the whole body of divinity sits gnaw a radish and be in continual warfare with louse and flea a therefore those art be best that have the near affinity with folly so be they most happy of all other that have least commerce with science and follow the guidance of nature who be in no wise imperfect unless perhaps we endeavor to leap over those bound she have appoint to u nature hat all false coloring and be ever best where she be least adulterated with art go to then dont you find among the several kind of living creature that they thrive best that understand no more than what nature teach them what be more prosperous or wonderful than the bee and though they have not the same judgment of sense a other body have yet wherein have architecture go beyond their building of house what philosopher ever found the like republic whereas the horse that come so near man in understanding and be therefore so familiar with him be also partaker of hi misery for while he think it a shame to lose the race it often happen that he crack hi wind and in the battle while he contend for victory he cut down himself and together with hi rider lie bite the earth not to mention those strong bit sharp spur close stable arm blow rider and briefly all that slavery he willingly submit to while imitate those men of valor he so eagerly strives to be revenge of the enemy than which how much more be the life of fly or bird to be wish for who live by the instinct of nature look no further than the present if yet man would but let them alone in it and if at anytime they chance to be take and be shut up in cage endeavor to imitate our speak ti strange how they degenerate from their native gaiety so much well in every respect be the work of nature than the adultery of art in like manner i can never sufficiently praise that pythagoras in a dunghill cock who be but one have be yet everything a philosopher a man a woman a king a private man a fish a horse a frog and i believe too a sponge and at last conclude that no creature be more miserable than man for that all other creature be content with those bound that nature set them only man endeavor to exceed them and again among men he give the precedency not to the learn or the great but the fool nor have that gryllus less wit than ulysses with hi many counsel who choose rather to lie grunt in a hog sty than be expose with the other to so many hazard nor do homer that father of trifle dissent from me who not only call all men wretched and full of calamity but often hi great pattern of wisdom ulysses miserable paris ajax and achilles nowhere and why i pray but that like a cunning fellow and one that be hi crafts master he do nothing without the advice of pallas in a word he be too wise and by that mean ran wide of nature a therefore among men they be least happy that study wisdom a be in this twice fool that when they be bear men they should yet so far forget their condition a to affect the life of god and after the example of the giant with their philosophical gimcrack make a war upon nature so they on the other side seem a little miserable a be possible who come near to beast and never attempt anything beyond man go to then let try how demonstrable this be not by enthymemes or the imperfect syllogism of the stoic but by plain downright and ordinary example and now by the immortal god i think nothing more happy than that generation of men we commonly call fool idiots lackwits and dolt splendid title too a i conceive them ill tell you a thing which at first perhaps may seem foolish and absurd yet nothing more true and first they be not afraid of deathno small evil by jupiter they be not torment with the conscience of evil act not terrify with the fable of ghost nor frighten with spirit and goblin they be not distract with the fear of evil to come nor the hope of future good in short they be not disturb with those thousand of care to which this life be subject they be neither modest nor fearful nor ambitious nor envious nor love they any man and lastly if they should come nearer even to the very ignorance of brute they could not sin for so hold the divine and now tell me you wise fool with how many troublesome care your mind be continually perplexed heap together all the discommodities of your life and then youll be sensible from how many evils i have deliver my fool add to this that they be not only merry play sing and laugh themselves but make mirth wherever they come a special privilege it seem the god have give them to refresh the pensiveness of life whence it be that whereas the world be so differently affect one towards another that all men indifferently admit them a their companion desire feed cherish embrace them take their part upon all occasion and permit them without offense to do or say what they like and so little do everything desire to hurt them that even the very beast by a kind of natural instinct of their innocence no doubt pas by their injury for of them it may be truly say that they be consecrate to the god and therefore and not without cause do men have them in such esteem whence be it els that they be in so great request with prince that they can neither eat nor drink go anywhere or be an hour without them nay and in some degree they prefer these fool before their crabbish wise men whom yet they keep about them for state sake nor do i conceive the reason so difficult or that it should seem strange why they be prefer before the other for that these wise men speak to prince about nothing but grave serious matter and trust to their own part and learn do not fear sometimes to grate their tender ear with smart truth but fool fit them with that they most delight in a jest laughter abuse of other men wanton pastime and the like again take notice of this no contemptible blessing which nature have give fool that they be the only plain honest men and such a speak truth and what be more commendable than truth for though that proverb of alcibiades in plato attribute truth to drunkard and child yet the praise of it be particularly mine even from the testimony of euripides among whose other thing there be extant that hi honorable say concern u a fool speak foolish thing for whatever a fool have in hi heart he both show it in hi look and express it in hi discourse while the wise men be those two tongue which the same euripides mention whereof the one speaks truth the other what they judge most seasonable for the occasion these be they that turn black into white blow hot and cold with the same breath and carry a far different mean in their breast from what they feign with their tongue yet in the midst of all their prosperity prince in this respect seem to me most unfortunate because have no one to tell them truth they be force to receive flatterer for friend but someone may say the ear of prince be stranger to truth and for this reason they avoid those wise men because they fear l someone more frank than the rest should dare to speak to them thing rather true than pleasant for so the matter be that they dont much care for truth and yet this be find by experience among my fool that not only truth but even open reproach be hear with pleasure so that the same thing which if it come from a wise man mouth might prove a capital crime speak by a fool be receive with delight for truth carry with it a certain peculiar power of please if no accident fall in to give occasion of offense which faculty the god have give only to fool and for the same reason be it that woman be so earnestly delight with this kind of men a be more propense by nature to pleasure and toy and whatsoever they may happen to do with them although sometimes it be of the most serious yet they turn it to jest and laughter a that sex be ever quickwitted especially to color their own fault but to return to the happiness of fool who when they have pass over this life with a great deal of pleasantness and without so much a the least fear or sense of death they go straight forth into the elysian field to recreate their pious and careless soul with such sport a they use here let proceed then and compare the condition of any of your wise men with that of this fool fancy to me now some example of wisdom youd set up against him one that have spend hi childhood and youth in learn the science and lose the sweet part of hi life in watching care study and for the remain part of it never so much a taste the least of pleasure ever spar poor sad sour unjust and rigorous to himself and troublesome and hateful to other break with paleness leanness crassness sore eye and an old age and death contract before their time though yet what matter be it when he die that never live and such be the picture of this great wise man and here again do those frog of the stoic croak at me and say that nothing be more miserable than madness but folly be the next degree if not the very thing for what els be madness than for a man to be out of hi wit but to let them see how they be clean out of the way with the mus good favor well take this syllogism in piece subtly argue i must confess but a socrates in plato teach u how by split one venus and one cupid to make two of either in like manner should those logician have do and distinguish madness from madness if at least they would be think to be well in their wit themselves for all madness be not miserable or horace have never call hi poetical fury a beloved madness nor plato place the rapture of poet prophet and lover among the chief blessing of this life nor that sibyl in virgil call aeneas travel mad labor but there be two sort of madness the one that which the revengeful fury send privily from hell as often a they let loose their snake and put into men breast either the desire of war or an insatiate thirst after gold or some dishonest love or parricide or incest or sacrilege or the like plague or when they terrify some guilty soul with the conscience of hi crime the other but nothing like this that which come from me and be of all other thing the most desirable which happen as often a some please dotage not only clear the mind of it troublesome care but render it more jocund and this be that which a a special blessing of the god cicero write to hi friend atticus wish to himself that he might be the less sensible of those misery that then hang over the commonwealth nor be that grecian in horace much wide of it who be so far make that he would sit by himself whole day in the theatre laughing and clap hi hand a if he have see some tragedy act whereas in truth there be nothing present yet in other thing a man well enough pleasant among hi friend kind to hi wife and so good a master to hi servant that if they have break the seal of hi bottle he would not have run mad for it but at last when by the care of hi friend and physic he be free from hi distemper and become hi own man again he thus expostulate with them now by pollux my friend you have rather kill than preserve me in thus force me from my pleasure by which you see he like it so well that he lose it against hi will and trust me i think they be the madder of the two and have the great need of hellebore that should offer to look upon so pleasant a madness a an evil to be remove by physic though yet i have not determine whether every distemper of the sense or understand be to be call madness for neither he that have weak eye should take a mule for an as nor he that should admire an insipid poem a excellent would be presently think mad but he that not only err in hi sens but be deceive also in hi judgment and that too more than ordinary and upon all occasionshe i must confess would be think to come very near to it a if anyone hear an as bray should take it for excellent music or a beggar conceive himself a king and yet this kind of madness if a it commonly happen it turn to pleasure it bring a great delight not only to them that be possess with it but to those also that behold it though perhaps they may not be altogether so mad a the other for the specie of this madness be much large than the people take it to be for one mad man laugh at another and beget themselves a mutual pleasure nor do it seldom happen that he that be the more mad laugh at him that be less mad and in this every man be the more happy in how many respect the more he be mad and if i be judge in the case he should be range in that class of folly that be peculiarly mine which in truth be so large and universal that i scarce know anyone in all mankind that be wise at all hour or have not some tang or other of madness and to this class do they appertain that slight everything in comparison of hunt and protest they take an unimaginable pleasure to hear the yell of the horn and the yelp of the hound and i believe could pick somewhat extraordinary out of their very excrement and then what pleasure they take to see a buck or the like unlaced let ordinary fellow cut up an ox or a wether twere a crime to have this do by anything less than a gentleman who with hi hat off on hi bare knee and a couteau for that purpose for every sword or knife be not allowable with a curious superstition and certain posture lay open the several part in their respective order while they that hem him in admire it with silence a some new religious ceremony though perhaps they have see it a hundred time before and if any of them chance to get the least piece of it he presently think himself no small gentleman in all which they drive at nothing more than to become beast themselves while yet they imagine they live the life of prince and next these may be reckon those that have such an itch of build one while change round into square and presently again square into round never know either measure or end till at last reduced to the utmost poverty there remain not to them so much a a place where they may lay their head or wherewith to fill their belly and why all this but that they may pass over a few year in feed their foolish fancy and in my opinion next these may be reckon such a with their new invention and occult art undertake to change the form of thing and hunt all about after a certain fifth essence men so bewitch with this present hope that it never repent them of their pain or expense but be ever contrive how they may cheat themselves till have spend all there be not enough leave them to provide another furnace and yet they have not do dream these their pleasant dream but encourage other as much a in them lie to the same happiness and at last when they be quite lose in all their expectation they cheer up themselves with this sentence in great thing the very attempt be enough and then complain of the shortness of man life that be not sufficient for so great an understanding and then for gamest i be a little doubtful whether they be to be admit into our college and yet tis a foolish and ridiculous sight to see some addict so to it that they can no sooner hear the rattling of the dice but their heart leap and dance again and then when time after time they be so far draw on with the hope of win that they have make shipwreck of all and have split their ship on that rock of dice no less terrible than the bishop and hi clerk scarce get alive to shore they choose rather to cheat any man of their just debt than not pay the money they lose l otherwise forsooth they be think no men of their word again what be it i pray to see old fellow and half blind to play with spectacle nay and when a justly deserve gout have knot their knuckle to hire a caster or one that may put the dice in the box for them a pleasant thing i must confess do it not for the most part end in quarrel and therefore belongs rather to the fury than me but there be no doubt but that that kind of men be wholly ours who love to hear or tell feign miracle and strange lie and be never weary of any tale though never so long so it be of ghost spirit goblin devil or the like which the further they be from truth the more readily they be believe and the more do they tickle their itching ear and these serve not only to pass away time but bring profit especially to mass priest and pardoner and next to these be they that have get a foolish but pleasant persuasion that if they can but see a wooden or painted polypheme christopher they shall not die that day or do but salute a carved barbara in the usual set form that he shall return safe from battle or make hi application to erasmus on certain day with some small wax candle and proper prayer that he shall quickly be rich nay they have get a hercules another hippolytus and a st george whose horse most religiously set out with trapping and boss there want little but they worship however they endeavor to make him their friend by some present or other and to swear by hi master brazen helmet be an oath for a prince or what should i say of them that hug themselves with their counterfeit pardon that have measure purgatory by an hourglass and can without the least mistake demonstrate it age year month day hour minute and second a it be in a mathematical table or what of those who have confidence in certain magical charm and short prayer invent by some pious imposter either for hi souls health or profit sake promise to themselves everything wealth honor pleasure plenty good health long life lively old age and the next place to christ in the other world which yet they desire may not happen too soon that be to say before the pleasure of this life have leave them and now suppose some merchant soldier or judge out of so many rapine part with some small piece of money he straight conceives all that sink of hi whole life quite cleanse so many perjury so many lust so many debauchery so many contention so many murder so many deceit so many breach of trust so many treachery buy off a it be by compact and so buy off that they may begin upon a new score but what be more foolish than those or rather more happy who daily recite those seven verse of the psalm promise to themselves more than the top of felicity which magical verse some devil or other a merry one without doubt but more a blab of hi tongue than crafty be believe to have discover to st bernard but not without a trick and these be so foolish that i be half ashamed of them myself and yet they be approve and that not only by the common people but even the professor of religion and what be not they also almost the same where several country avouch to themselves their peculiar saint and a everyone of them have hi particular gift so also hi particular form of worship a one be good for the toothache another for groan woman a third for steal good a fourth for make a voyage prosperous and a fifth to cure sheep of the rot and so of the rest for it would be too tedious to run over all and some there be that be good for more thing than one but chiefly the virgin mother to whom the common people do in a manner attribute more than to the son yet what do they beg of these saint but what belong to folly to examine it a little among all those offering which be so frequently hang up in church nay up to the very roof of some of them do you ever see the least acknowledgment from anyone that have leave hi folly or grow a hair breadth the wiser one escape a shipwreck and he get safe to shore another run through in a duel recover another while the rest be fight ran out of the field no less luckily than valiantly another condemn to be hang by the favor of some saint or other a friend to thief get off himself by impeach hi fellow another escape by break prison another recover from hi fever in spite of hi physician anothers poison turn to a looseness prove hi remedy rather than death and that to hi wife no small sorrow in that she lose both her labor and her charge anothers cart break and he save hi horse another preserve from the fall of a house all these hang up their tablet but no one give thanks for hi recovery from folly so sweet a thing it be not to be wise that on the contrary men rather pray against anything than folly but why do i launch out into this ocean of superstition had i a hundred tongue a many mouth and a voice never so strong yet be i not able to run over the several sort of fool or all the name of folly so thick do they swarm everywhere and yet your priest make no scruple to receive and cherish them a proper instrument of profit whereas if some scurvy wise fellow should step up and speak thing a they be a to live well be the way to die well the best way to get quit of sin be to add to the money you give the hatred of sin tear watch prayer fasting and amendment of life such or such a saint will favor you if you imitate hi lifethese i say and the likeshould this wise man chat to the people from what happiness into how great trouble would he draw them of this college also be they who in their lifetime appoint with what solemnity theyll be bury and particularly set down how many torch how many mourner how many singer how many almsmen they will have at it a if any sense of it could come to them or that it be a shame to them that their corpse be not honorably inter so curious be they herein a if like the aediles of old these be to present some show or banquet to the people and though i be in haste yet i can not yet pass by them who though they differ nothing from the mean cobbler yet tis scarcely credible how they flatter themselves with the empty title of nobility one derive hi pedigree from aeneas another from brutus a third from the star by the tail of ursa major they show you on every side the statue and picture of their ancestor run over their greatgrandfathers and the greatgreatgrandfathers of both line and the ancient match of their family when themselves yet be but once remove from a statue if not bad than those trifle they boast of and yet by mean of this pleasant selflove they live a happy life nor be they less fool who admire these beast a if they be god but what do i speak of any one or the other particular kind of men a if this selflove have not the same effect everywhere and render most men superabundantly happy a when a fellow more deformed than a baboon shall believe himself handsome than homer nereus another as soon a he can draw two or three line with a compass presently think himself a euclid a third that understand music no more than my horse and for hi voice as hoarse a a dunghill cock shall yet conceive himself another hermogenes but of all madness thats the most pleasant when a man see another any way excellent in what he pretend to himself make hi boast of it as confidently a if it be hi own and such be that rich fellow in seneca who whenever he tell a story have hi servant at hi elbow to prompt him the name and to that height have they flatter him that he do not question but he might venture a rubber at cuff a man otherwise so weak he could scarce stand only presume on this that he have a company of sturdy servant about him or to what purpose be it i should mind you of our professor of art forasmuch a this selflove be so natural to them all that they have rather part with their father land than their foolish opinion but chiefly player fiddler orator and poet of which the more ignorant each of them be the more insolently he please himself that be to say vaunt and spread out hi plume and like lip find like lettuce nay the more foolish anything be the more ti admire the great number be ever tickle at the bad thing because a i say before most men be so subject to folly and therefore if the more foolish a man be the more he please himself and be admire by other to what purpose should he beat hi brain about true knowledge which first will cost him dear and next render him the more troublesome and less confident and lastly please only a few and now i consider it nature have plant not only in particular men but even in every nation and scarce any city be there without it a kind of common selflove and hence be it that the english besides other thing particularly challenge to themselves beauty music and feast the scot be proud of their nobility alliance to the crown and logical subtlety the french think themselves the only wellbred men the parisian exclude all other arrogate to themselves the only knowledge of divinity the italian affirm they be the only master of good letter and eloquence and flatter themselves on this account that of all other they only be not barbarous in which kind of happiness those of rome claim the first place still dream to themselves of somewhat i know not what of old rome the venetian fancy themselves happy in the opinion of their nobility the greek a if they be the only author of science swell themselves with the title of the ancient heroes the turk and all that sink of the truly barbarous challenge to themselves the only glory of religion and laugh at christian a superstitious and much more pleasantly the jew expect to this day the come of the messiah and so obstinately contend for their law of moses the spaniard give place to none in the reputation of soldiery the german pride themselves in their tallness of stature and skill in magic and not to instance in every particular you see i conceive how much satisfaction this selflove who have a sister also not unlike herself call flattery begets everywhere for selflove be no more than the soothing of a man self which do to another be flattery and though perhaps at this day it may be think infamous yet it be so only with them that be more take with word than thing they think truth be inconsistent with flattery but that it be much otherwise we may learn from the example of true beast what more fawning than a dog and yet what more trusty what have more of those little trick than a squirrel and yet what more loving to man unless perhaps youll say men have well converse with fierce lion merciless tiger and furious leopard for that flattery be the most pernicious of all thing by mean of which some treacherous person and mocker have run the credulous into such mischief but this of mine proceeds from a certain gentleness and uprightness of mind and come near to virtue than it opposite austerity or a morose and troublesome peevishness a horace call it this support the dejected relieve the distressed encourage the fainting awaken the stupid refresh the sick supply the untractable join love together and keep them so join it entice child to take their learning make old men frolic and under the color of praise do without offense both tell princes their fault and show them the way to amend them in short it make every man the more jocund and acceptable to himself which be the chief point of felicity again what be more friendly than when two horse scrub one another and to say nothing of it that it a main part of physic and the only thing in poetry ti the delight and relish of all human society but tis a sad thing they say to be mistake nay rather he be most miserable that be not so for they be quite beside the mark that place the happiness of men in thing themselves since it only depend upon opinion for so great be the obscurity and variety of human affair that nothing can be clearly know a it be truly say by our academic the least insolent of all the philosopher or if it could it would but obstruct the pleasure of life lastly the mind of man be so framed that it be rather take with the false color than truth of which if anyone have a mind to make the experiment let him go to church and hear sermon in which if there be anything serious deliver the audience be either asleep yawning or weary of it but if the preacherpardon my mistake i would have say declaimeras too often it happen fall but into an old wife story theyre presently awake prick up their ear and gape after it in like manner if there be any poetical saint or one of whom there go more story than ordinary a for example a george a christopher or a barbara you shall see him more religiously worship than peter paul or even christ himself but these thing be not for this place and now at how cheap a rate be this happiness purchase forasmuch a to the thing itself a man whole endeavor be require be it never so inconsiderable but the opinion of it be easily take up which yet conduce as much or more to happiness for suppose a man be eat rotten stockfish the very smell of which would choke another and yet believe it a dish for the god what difference be there a to hi happiness whereas on the contrary if anothers stomach should turn at a sturgeon wherein i pray be he happy than the other if a man have a crook illfavored wife who yet in hi eye may stand in competition with venus be it not the same a if she be truly beautiful or if see an ugly illpointed piece he should admire the work a believe it some great master hand be he not much happy think you than they that buy such thing at vast rate and yet perhaps reap less pleasure from them than the other i know one of my name that give hi new married wife some counterfeit jewel and a he be a pleasant droll persuade her that they be not only right but of an inestimable price and what difference i pray to her that be as well pleased and content with glass and keep it as warily a if it have be a treasure in the meantime the husband save hi money and have this advantage of her folly that he oblige her as much a if he have buy them at a great rate or what difference think you between those in plato imaginary cave that stand gap at the shadow and figure of thing so they please themselves and have no need to wish and that wise man who be get loose from them see thing truly a they be whereas that cobbler in lucian if he might always have continue hi golden dream he would never have desire any other happiness so then there be no difference or if there be the fool have the advantage first in that their happiness cost them least that be to say only some small persuasion next that they enjoy it in common and the possession of no good can be delightful without a companion for who do not know what a dearth there be of wise men if yet any one be to be find and though the greek for these so many age have account upon seven only yet so help me hercules do but examine them narrowly and ill be hang if you find one halfwitted fellow nay or so much a onequarter of a wise man among them all for whereas among the many praise of bacchus they reckon this the chief that he wash away care and that too in an instant do but sleep off hi weak spirit and they come on again a we say on horseback but how much large and more present be the benefit you receive by me since a it be with a perpetual drunkenness i fill your mind with mirth fancy and jollity and that too without any trouble nor be there any man live whom i let be without it whereas the gift of the god be scramble some to one and some to another the sprightly delicious wine that drive away care and leaf such a flavor behind it grow not everywhere beauty the gift of venus happen to few and to fewer give mercury eloquence hercules make not everyone rich homer jupiter bestow not empire on all men mar oftentimes favor neither side many return sad from apollo oracle phoebus sometimes shoot a plague among u neptune drown more than he save to say nothing of those mischievous god pluto ates punishment favor and the like not god but executioner i be that only folly that so readily and indifferently bestow my benefit on all nor do i look to be entreat or be i subject to take pet and require an expiatory sacrifice if some ceremony be omit nor do i beat heaven and earth together if when the rest of the god be invite i be pass by or not admit to the stream of their sacrifice for the rest of the god be so curious in this point that such an omission may chance to spoil a man business and therefore one have as good even let them alone a worship them just like some men who be so hard to please and withal so ready to do mischief that ti well be a strange than have any familiarity with them but no man youll say ever sacrifice to folly or build me a temple and troth a i say before i can not but wonder at the ingratitude yet because i be easily to be entreat i take this also in good part though truly i can scarce request it for why should i require incense wafer a goat or sow when all men pay me that worship everywhere which be so much approve even by our very divines unless perhaps i should envy diana that her sacrifice be mingle with human blood then do i conceive myself most religiously worship when everywhere a ti generally do men embrace me in their mind express me in their manner and represent me in their life which worship of the saint be not so ordinary among christian how many be there that burn candle to the virgin mother and that too at noonday when theres no need of them but how few be there that study to imitate her in pureness of life humility and love of heavenly thing which be the true worship and most acceptable to heaven besides why should i desire a temple when the whole world be my temple and im deceive or tis a goodly one nor can i want priest but in a land where there be no men nor be i yet so foolish a to require statue or paint image which do often obstruct my worship since among the stupid and gross multitude those figure be worship for the saint themselves and so it would fare with me a it do with them that be turn out of door by their substitute no i have statue enough and as many a there be men everyone bearing my lively resemblance in hi face how unwilling so ever he be to the contrary and therefore there be no reason why i should envy the rest of the god if in particular place they have their particular worship and that too on set daysas phoebus at rhodes at cyprus venus at argo juno at athens minerva in olympus jupiter at tarentum neptune and near the hellespont priapusas long a the world in general performs me every day much good sacrifice wherein notwithstanding if i shall seem to anyone to have speak more boldly than truly let u if you please look a little into the life of men and it will easily appear not only how much they owe to me but how much they esteem me even from the high to the low and yet we will not run over the life of everyone for that would be too long but only some few of the great one from whence we shall easily conjecture the rest for to what purpose be it to say anything of the common people who without dispute be wholly mine for they abound everywhere with so many several sort of folly and be every day so busy in invent new that a thousand democriti be too few for so general a laughter though there be another democritus to laugh at them too ti almost incredible what sport and pastime they daily make the god for though they set aside their sober forenoon hour to dispatch business and receive prayer yet when they begin to be well whittle with nectar and can not think of anything thats serious they get them up into some part of heaven that have good prospect than other and thence look down upon the action of men nor be there anything that please them well good good what an excellent sight it be how many several hurlyburlies of fool for i myself sometimes sit among those poetical god heres one desperately in love with a young wench and the more she slight him the more outrageously he love her another marry a woman money not herself anothers jealousy keep more eye on her than argo another become a mourner and how foolishly he carry it nay hire other to bear him company to make it more ridiculous another weeps over hi motherinlaws grave another spend all he can rap and run on hi belly to be the more hungry after it another think there be no happiness but in sleep and idleness another turmoil himself about other men business and neglect hi own another think himself rich in take up money and change security a we say borrow of peter to pay paul and in a short time become bankrupt another starve himself to enrich hi heir another for a small and uncertain gain expose hi life to the casualty of sea and wind which yet no money can restore another have rather get rich by war than live peaceably at home and some there be that think them easy attain by court old childless men with present and other again by make rich old woman believe they love them both which afford the god most excellent pastime to see them cheat by those person they think to have overcaught but the most foolish and base of all other be our merchant to wit such a venture on everything be it never so dishonest and manage it no good who though they lie by no allowance swear and forswear steal cozen and cheat yet shuffle themselves into the first rank and all because they have gold ring on their finger nor be they without their flattering friar that admire them and give them openly the title of honorable in hop no doubt to get some small snip of it themselves there be also a kind of pythagorean with whom all thing be so common that if they get anything under their cloak they make no more scruple of carry it away than if it be their own by inheritance there be other too that be only rich in conceit and while they fancy to themselves pleasant dream conceive that enough to make them happy some desire to be account wealthy abroad and be yet ready to starve at home one make what haste he can to set all go and another rake it together by right or wrong this man be ever labor for public honor and another lie sleep in a chimney corner a great many undertake endless suit and outvie one another who shall most enrich the dilatory judge or corrupt advocate one be all for innovation and another for some great heknowsnotwhat another leave hi wife and child at home and go to jerusalem rome or in pilgrimage to st james where he have no business in short if a man like menippus of old could look down from the moon and behold those innumerable rufflings of mankind he would think he saw a swarm of fly and gnat quarrel among themselves fight lay trap for one another snatch play wanton grow up fall and die nor be it to be believe what stir what broil this little creature raise and yet in how short a time it come to nothing itself while sometimes war other time pestilence sweep off many thousand of them together but let me be most foolish myself and one whom democritus may not only laugh at but flout if i go one foot far in the discovery of the folly and madness of the common people ill betake me to them that carry the reputation of wise men and hunt after that golden bough a say the proverb among whom the grammarian hold the first place a generation of men than whom nothing would be more miserable nothing more perplexed nothing more hat of the god do not i allay the trouble of that pitiful profession with a certain kind of pleasant madness for they be not only subject to those five curse with which home begin hi iliad a say the greek epigram but six hundred a be ever hungerstarved and sloven in their schoolsschools do i say nay rather cloister bridewells or slaughterhousesgrown old among a company of boy deaf with their noise and pin away with stench and nastiness and yet by my courtesy it be that they think themselves the most excellent of all men so greatly do they please themselves in fright a company of fearful boy with a thundering voice and big look torment them with ferule rod and whip and lay about them without fear or wit imitate the as in the lion skin in the meantime all that nastiness seem absolute spruceness that stench a perfume and that miserable slavery a kingdom and such too a they would not change their tyranny for phalaris or dionysius empire nor be they less happy in that new opinion they have take up of be learn for whereas most of them beat into boy head nothing but foolish toy yet you good god what palemon what donatus do they not scorn in comparison of themselves and so i know not by what trick they bring it about that to their boy foolish mother and doltheaded father they pass for such a they fancy themselves add to this that other pleasure of theirs that if any of them happen to find out who be anchises mother or pick out of some wormeaten manuscript a word not commonly knownas suppose it bubsequa for a cowherd bovinator for a wrangler manticulator for a cutpurseor dig up the ruin of some ancient monument with the letter half eat out o jupiter what tower what triumph what commendation a if they have conquer africa or take in babylon but what of this when they give up and down their foolish insipid verse and there want not other that admire them a much they believe presently that virgil soul be transmigrate into them but nothing like this when with mutual compliment they praise admire and claw one another whereas if another do but slip a word and one more quicksighted than the rest discover it by accident o hercules what uproars what bicker what taunt what invectives if i lie let me have the ill will of all the grammarian i know in my time one of many art a grecian a latinist a mathematician a philosopher a physician a man master of them all and sixty year of age who lay by all the rest perplexed and torment himself for above twenty year in the study of grammar fully reckon himself a prince if he might but live so long till he could certainly determine how the eight part of speech be to be distinguish which none of the greek or latin have yet fully clear a if it be a matter to be decide by the sword if a man make an adverb of a conjunction and for this cause be it that we have as many grammar a grammarian nay more forasmuch a my friend aldus have give u above five not pass by any kind of grammar how barbarously or tediously soever compile which he have not turn over and examined envy every man attempt in this kind how to be pity than happy a person that be ever torment themselves add change put in blot out revise reprint show it to friend and nine year in correct yet never fully satisfy at so great a rate do they purchase this vain reward to wit praise and that too of a very few with so many watching so much sweat so much vexation and loss of sleep the most precious of all thing add to this the waste of health spoil of complexion weakness of eye or rather blindness poverty envy abstinence from pleasure overhasty old age untimely death and the like so highly do this wise man value the approbation of one or two bleareyed fellow but how much happier be this my writer dotage who never study for anything but put in write whatever he please or what come first in hi head though it be but hi dream and all this with small waste of paper a well know that the vainer those trifle be the high esteem they will have with the great number that be to say all the fool and unlearned and what matter be it to slight those few learn if yet they ever read them or of what authority will the censure of so few wise men be against so great a cloud of gainsay but they be the wiser that put out other men work for their own and transfer that glory which other with great pain have obtain to themselves rely on this that they conceive though it should so happen that their theft be never so plainly detect that yet they should enjoy the pleasure of it for the present and tis worth one while to consider how they please themselves when they be applaud by the common people point at in a crowd this be that excellent person lie on bookseller stall and in the top of every page have three hard word read but chiefly exotic and next degree to conjure which by the immortal god what be they but mere word and again if you consider the world by how few understood and praise by few for even among the unlearned there be different palate or what be it that their own very names be often counterfeit or borrow from some book of the ancient when one style himself telemachus another sthenelus a third laertes a fourth polycrates a fifth thrasymachus so that there be no difference whether they title their book with the tale of a tub or accord to the philosopher by alpha beta but the most pleasant of all be to see them praise one another with reciprocal epistle verse and encomium fool their fellow fool and dunce their brother dunce this in the other opinion be an absolute alcaeus and the other in hi a very callimachus he look upon tully a nothing to the other and the other again pronounce him more learned than plato and sometimes too they pick out their antagonist and think to raise themselves a fame by write one against the other while the giddy multitude be so long divide to whether of the two they shall determine the victory till each go off conqueror and a if he have do some great action fancy himself a triumph and now wise men laugh at these thing as foolish a indeed they be who deny it yet in the meantime such be my kindness to them they live a merry life and would not change their imaginary triumph no not with the scipio while yet those learn men though they laugh their fill and reap the benefit of the other folly can not without ingratitude deny but that even they too be not a little beholding to me themselves and among them our advocate challenge the first place nor be there any sort of people that please themselves like them for while they daily roll sisyphus hi stone and quote you a thousand case a it be in a breath no matter how little to the purpose and heap gloss upon gloss and opinion on the neck of opinion they bring it at last to this pas that that study of all other seem the most difficult add to these our logician and sophists a generation of men more prattling than an echo and the bad of them able to outchat a hundred of the best picked gossip and yet their condition would be much good be they only full of word and not so give to scold that they most obstinately hack and hew one another about a matter of nothing and make such a sputter about term and word till they have quite lose the sense and yet they be so happy in the good opinion of themselves that as soon a they be furnish with two or three syllogism they dare boldly enter the list against any man upon any point a not doubt but to run him down with noise though the opponent be another stentor and next these come our philosopher so much reverence for their furred gown and starch beard that they look upon themselves a the only wise men and all other a shadow and yet how pleasantly do they dote while they frame in their head innumerable world measure out the sun the moon the star nay and heaven itself a it be with a pair of compass lay down the cause of lightning wind eclipse and other the like inexplicable matter and all this too without the least doubting a if they be nature secretary or drop down among u from the council of the god while in the meantime nature laugh at them and all their blind conjecture for that they know nothing even this be a sufficient argument that they dont agree among themselves and so be incomprehensible touch every particular these though they have not the least degree of knowledge profess yet that they have master all nay though they neither know themselves nor perceive a ditch or block that lie in their way for that perhaps most of them be half blind or their wit a woolgathering yet give out that they have discover idea universality separate form first matter quiddity haecceity formality and the like stuff thing so thin and bodiless that i believe even lynceus himself be not able to perceive them but then chiefly do they disdain the unhallowed crowd as often a with their triangle quadrangle circle and the like mathematical device more confounded than a labyrinth and letter dispose one against the other a it be in battle array they cast a mist before the eye of the ignorant nor be there want of this kind some that pretend to foretell thing by the star and make promise of miracle beyond all thing of soothsaying and be so fortunate a to meet with people that believe them but perhaps i have well pas over our divine in silence and not stir this pool or touch this fair but unsavory plant a a kind of men that be supercilious beyond comparison and to that too implacable l set them about my ear they attack me by troop and force me to a recantation sermon which if i refuse they straight pronounce me a heretic for this be the thunderbolt with which they fright those whom they be resolve not to favor and truly though there be few other that less willingly acknowledge the kindness i have do them yet even these too stand fast bound to me upon no ordinary account while be happy in their own opinion and a if they dwell in the third heaven they look with haughtiness on all other a poor creep thing and could almost find in their heart to pity them while hedge in with so many magisterial definition conclusion corollary proposition explicit and implicit they abound with so many startingholes that vulcan net can not hold them so fast but theyll slip through with their distinction with which they so easily cut all knot asunder that a hatchet could not have do it well so plentiful be they in their newfound word and prodigious term besides while they explicate the most hidden mystery accord to their own fancyas how the world be first make how original sin be derive to posterity in what manner how much room and how long time christ lay in the virgin womb how accident subsist in the eucharist without their subject but these be common and threadbare these be worthy of our great and illuminated divine a the world call them at these if ever they fall athwart them they prick upas whether there be any instant of time in the generation of the second person whether there be more than one filiation in christ whether it be a possible proposition that god the father hat the son or whether it be possible that christ could have take upon him the likeness of a woman or of the devil or of an as or of a stone or of a gourd and then how that gourd should have preach wrought miracle or be hang on the cross and what peter have consecrate if he have administer the sacrament at what time the body of christ hung upon the cross or whether at the same time he might be say to be man whether after the resurrection there will be any eating and drinking since we be so much afraid of hunger and thirst in this world there be infinite of these subtle trifle and other more subtle than these of notion relation instant formality quiddity haecceity which no one can perceive without a lynceus whose eye could look through a stone wall and discover those thing through the thick darkness that never be add to this those their other determination and those too so contrary to common opinion that those oracle of the stoic which they call paradox seem in comparison of these but blockish and idleas ti a less crime to kill a thousand men than to set a stitch on a poor man shoe on the sabbath day and that a man should rather choose that the whole world with all food and raiment a they say should perish than tell a lie though never so inconsiderable and these most subtle subtlety be render yet more subtle by the several method of so many schoolman that one might sooner wind himself out of a labyrinth than the entanglement of the realist nominalist thomists albertists occamists scotists nor have i name all the several sect but only some of the chief in all which there be so much doctrine and so much difficulty that i may well conceive the apostle have they be to deal with these new kind of divine have need to have pray in aid of some other spirit paul know what faith be and yet when he say faith be the substance of thing hop for and the evidence of thing not see he do not define it doctorlike and a he understand charity well himself so he do a illogically divide and define it to other in hi first epistle to the corinthian chapter the thirteenth and devoutly no doubt do the apostle consecrate the eucharist yet have they be ask the question touch the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem of transubstantiation of the manner how the same body can be in several place at one and the same time of the difference the body of christ have in heaven from that of the cross or this in the sacrament in what point of time transubstantiation be whereas prayer by mean of which it be a be a discrete quantity be transient they would not i conceive have answer with the same subtlety a the scotists dispute and define it they know the mother of jesus but which of them have so philosophically demonstrated how she be preserve from original sin a have do our divine peter receive the key and from him too that would not have trust them with a person unworthy yet whether he have understanding or no i know not for certainly he never attain to that subtlety to determine how he could have the key of knowledge that have no knowledge himself they baptize far and near and yet teach nowhere what be the formal material efficient and final cause of baptism nor make the least mention of delible and indelible character they worship ti true but in spirit follow herein no other than that of the gospel god be a spirit and they that worship must worship him in spirit and truth yet it do not appear it be at that time reveal to them that an image sketch on the wall with a coal be to be worship with the same worship a christ himself if at least the two forefinger be stretch out the hair long and uncut and have three ray about the crown of the head for who can conceive these thing unless he have spend at least six and thirty year in the philosophical and supercelestial whim of aristotle and the schoolman in like manner the apostle press to u grace but which of them distinguishes between free grace and grace that make a man acceptable they exhort u to good work and yet determine not what be the work work and what a resting in the work do they incite u to charity and yet make no difference between charity infuse and charity wrought in u by our own endeavor nor do they declare whether it be an accident or a substance a thing create or uncreated they detest and abominate sin but let me not live if they could define accord to art what that be which we call sin unless perhaps they be inspire by the spirit of the scotists nor can i be bring to believe that paul by whose learn you may judge the rest would have so often condemned question dispute genealogy and a himself call them strife of word if he have thoroughly understood those subtlety especially when all the debate and controversy of those time be rude and blockish in comparison of the more than chrysippean subtlety of our master although yet the gentleman be so modest that if they meet with anything write by the apostle not so smooth and even a might be expect from a master they do not presently condemn it but handsomely bend it to their own purpose so great respect and honor do they give partly to antiquity and partly to the name of apostle and truly twas a kind of injustice to require so great thing of them that never hear the least word from their master concern it and so if the like happen in chrysostom basil jerome they think it enough to say they be not oblige by it the apostle also confute the heathen philosopher and jews a people than whom none more obstinate but rather by their good life and miracle than syllogism and yet there be scarce one among them that be capable of understand the least quodlibet of the scotists but now where be that heathen or heretic that must not presently stoop to such wiredrawn subtlety unless he be so thickskulled that he cant apprehend them or so impudent a to hiss them down or be furnish with the same trick be able to make hi party good with them a if a man should set a conjurer on work against a conjurer or fight with one hallow sword against another which would prove no other than a work to no purpose for my own part i conceive the christian would do much good if instead of those dull troop and company of soldier with which they have manage their war with such doubtful success they would send the bawling scotists the most obstinate occamists and invincible albertists to war against the turk and saracen and they would see i guess a most pleasant combat and such a victory a be never before for who be so faint whom their device will not enliven who so stupid whom such spur cant quicken or who so quicksighted before whose eye they cant cast a mist but youll say i jest nor be you without cause since even among divine themselves there be some that have learn well and be ready to turn their stomach at those foolish subtlety of the other there be some that detest them a a kind of sacrilege and count it the height of impiety to speak so irreverently of such hidden thing rather to be adore than explicate to dispute of them with such profane and heathenish nicety to define them so arrogantly and pollute the majesty of divinity with such pithless and sordid term and opinion meantime the other please nay hug themselves in their happiness and be so take up with these pleasant trifle that they have not so much leisure a to cast the least eye on the gospel or st paul epistle and while they play the fool at this rate in their school they make account the universal church would otherwise perish unless a the poet fancy of atlas that he support heaven with hi shoulder they underpropped the other with their syllogist buttress and how great a happiness be this think you while a if holy writ be a nose of wax they fashion and refashion it accord to their pleasure while they require that their own conclusion subscribe by two or three schoolman be account great than solon law and prefer before the papal decretals while a censor of the world they force everyone to a recantation that differs but a hairs breadth from the least of their explicit or implicit determination and those too they pronounce like oracle this proposition be scandalous this irreverent this have a smack of heresy this no very good sound so that neither baptism nor the gospel nor paul nor peter nor st jerome nor st augustine no nor most aristotelian thomas himself can make a man a christian without these bachelor too be pleased to give him hi grace and the like in their subtlety in judge for who would think he be no christian that should say these two speech matula putes and matula putet or olla fervere and ollam fervere be not both good latin unless their wisdom have teach u the contrary who have deliver the church from such mist of error which yet no one ever meet with have they not come out with some university seal for it and be they not most happy while they do these thing then for what concern hell how exactly they describe everything a if they have be conversant in that commonwealth most part of their time again how do they frame in their fancy new orb add to those we have already an eighth a goodly one no doubt and spacious enough l perhaps their happy soul might lack room to walk in entertain their friend and now and then play at football and with these and a thousand the like fopperies their head be so full stuffed and stretch that i believe jupiter brain be not near so big when be in labor with pallas he be behold to the midwifery of vulcan axe and therefore you must not wonder if in their public dispute they be so bound about the head l otherwise perhaps their brain might leap out nay i have sometimes laugh myself to see them so tower in their own opinion when they speak most barbarously and when they humh and hawh so pitifully that none but one of their own tribe can understand them they call it heights which the vulgar cant reach for they say tis beneath the dignity of divine mystery to be cramp and tie up to the narrow rule of grammarian from whence we may conjecture the great prerogative of divine if they only have the privilege of speak corruptly in which yet every cobbler think himself concern for hi share lastly they look upon themselves a somewhat more than men as often a they be devoutly salute by the name of our master in which they fancy there lie as much a in the jew jehovah and therefore they reckon it a crime if magister noster be write other than in capital letter and if anyone should preposterously say noster magister he have at once overturn the whole body of divinity and next these come those that commonly call themselves the religious and monks most false in both title when both a great part of them be farthest from religion and no men swarm thicker in all place than themselves nor can i think of anything that could be more miserable do not i support them so many several way for whereas all men detest them to that height that they take it for ill luck to meet one of them by chance yet such be their happiness that they flatter themselves for first they reckon it one of the main point of piety if they be so illiterate that they cant so much a read and then when they run over their office which they carry about them rather by tale than understand they believe the god more than ordinarily please with their braying and some there be among them that put off their trumpery at vast rate yet rove up and down for the bread they eat nay there be scarce an inn wagon or ship into which they intrude not to the no small damage of the commonwealth of beggar and yet like pleasant fellow with all this vileness ignorance rudeness and impudence they represent to u for so they call it the life of the apostle yet what be more pleasant than that they do all thing by rule and a it be a kind of mathematics the least swerving from which be a crime beyond forgivenessas how many knot their shoe must be tie with of what color everything be what distinction of habit of what stuff make how many straw broad their girdle and of what fashion how many bushel wide their cowl how many finger long their hair and how many hour sleep which exact equality how disproportionate it be among such variety of body and temper who be there that do not perceive it and yet by reason of these foolery they not only set slight by other but each different order men otherwise profess apostolical charity despise one another and for the different wearing of a habit or that ti of darker color they put all thing in combustion and among these there be some so rigidly religious that their upper garment be haircloth their inner of the fine linen and on the contrary other wear linen without and hair next their skin other again be a afraid to touch money a poison and yet neither forbear wine nor dally with woman in a word ti their only care that none of them come near one another in their manner of living nor do they endeavor how they may be like christ but how they may differ among themselves and another great happiness they conceive in their name while they call themselves cordiliers and among these too some be collet some minor some minim some cross and again these be benedictine those bernardines these carmelite those augustine these williamites and those jacobin a if it be not worth the while to be call christian and of these a great part build so much on their ceremony and petty tradition of men that they think one heaven be too poor a reward for so great merit little dreaming that the time will come when christ not regard any of these trifle will call them to account for hi precept of charity one shall show you a large trough full of all kind of fish another tumble you out so many bushel of prayer another reckon you so many myriad of fast and fetch them up again in one dinner by eat till he crack again another produce more bundle of ceremony than seven of the stout ship would be able to carry another brag he have not touch a penny these three score year without two pair of glove at least upon hi hand another wear a cowl so lined with grease that the poor tarpaulin would not stoop to take it up another will tell you he have live these fiftyfive year like a sponge continually fasten to the same place another be grow hoarse with hi daily chant another have contract a lethargy by hi solitary living and another the palsy in hi tongue for want of speak but christ interrupt them in their vanity which otherwise be endless will ask them whence this new kind of jew i acknowledge one commandment which be truly mine of which alone i hear nothing i promise ti true my father heritage and that without parable not to cowl odd prayer and fasting but to the duty of faith and charity nor can i acknowledge them that least acknowledge their fault they that would seem holy than myself let them if they like posse to themselves those three hundred sixtyfive heaven of basilides the heretic invention or command them whose foolish tradition they have prefer before my precept to erect them a new one when they shall hear these thing and see common ordinary person prefer before them with what countenance think you will they behold one another in the meantime they be happy in their hope and for this also they be behold to me and yet these kind of people though they be a it be of another commonwealth no man dare despise especially those beg friar because they be privy to all men secret by mean of confession a they call them which yet be no less than treason to discover unless be get drunk they have a mind to be pleasant and then all come out that be to say by hint and conjecture but suppress the name but if anyone should anger these wasp theyll sufficiently revenge themselves in their public sermon and so point out their enemy by circumlocution that theres no one but understand whom ti they mean unless he understand nothing at all nor will they give over their barking till you throw the dog a bone and now tell me what juggler or mountebank you have rather behold than hear them rhetorically play the fool in their preachment and yet most sweetly imitate what rhetorician have write touch the art of good speaking good god what several posture they have how they shift their voice sing out their word skip up and down and be ever and anon make such new face that they confound all thing with noise and yet this knack of theirs be no less a mystery that run in succession from one brother to another which though it be not lawful for me to know however ill venture at it by conjecture and first they invoke whatever they have scrap from the poet and in the next place if they be to discourse of charity they take their rise from the river nilus or to set out the mystery of the cross from bell and the dragon or to dispute of fast from the twelve sign of the zodiac or be to preach of faith ground their matter on the square of a circle i have hear myself one and he no small fooli be mistake i would have say scholarthat be in a famous assembly explain the mystery of the trinity that he might both let them see hi learning be not ordinary and withal satisfy some theological ear he take a new way to wit from the letter syllable and the word itself then from the coherence of the nominative case and the verb and the adjective and substantive and while most of the audience wonder and some of them mutter that of horace what do all this trumpery drive at at last he bring the matter to this head that he would demonstrate that the mystery of the trinity be so clearly express in the very rudiment of grammar that the best mathematician could not chalk it out more plainly and in this discourse do this most superlative theologian beat hi brain for eight whole month that at this hour hes as blind a a beetle to wit all the sight of hi eye be run into the sharpness of hi wit but for all that he think nothing of hi blindness rather take the same for too cheap a price of such a glory a he win thereby and besides him i meet with another some eighty year of age and such a divine that youd have swear scotus himself be revive in him he be upon the point of unfold the mystery of the name jesus do with wonderful subtlety demonstrate that there lay hidden in those letter whatever could be say of him for that it be only decline with three case he say it be a manifest token of the divine trinity and then that the first end in s the second in m the third in u there be in it an ineffable mystery to wit those three letter declare to u that he be the beginning middle and end summum medium et ultimum of all nay the mystery be yet more abstruse for he so mathematically split the word jesus into two equal part that he leave the middle letter by itself and then tell u that that letter in hebrew be schin or sin and that sin in the scotch tongue a he remember signify as much a sin from whence he gather that it be jesus that take away the sin of the world at which new exposition the audience be so wonderfully intent and struck with admiration especially the theologian that there want little but that niobelike they have be turn to stone whereas the like have almost happen to me a befell the priapus in horace and not without cause for when be the grecian demosthenes or roman cicero ever guilty of the like they think that introduction faulty that be wide of the matter a if it be not the way of carter and swineherd that have no more wit than god send them but these learn men think their preamble for so they call it then chiefly rhetorical when it have least coherence with the rest of the argument that the admire audience may in the meanwhile whisper to themselves what will he be at now in the third place they bring in instead of narration some text of scripture but handle them cursorily and a it be by the bye when yet it be the only thing they should have insist on and fourthly a it be change a part in the play they bolt out with some question in divinity and many time relate neither to earth nor heaven and this they look upon a a piece of art here they erect their theological crest and beat into the people ears those magnificent title of illustrious doctor subtle doctor most subtle doctor seraphic doctor cherubin doctor holy doctor unquestionable doctor and the like and then throw abroad among the ignorant people syllogisms major minor conclusion corollary supposition and those so weak and foolish that they be below pedantry there remain yet the fifth act in which one would think they should show their mastery and here they bring in some foolish insipid fable out of speculum historiale or gesta romanorum and expound it allegorically tropologically and anagogically and after this manner do they and their chimera and such a horace despair of compass when he write humano capiti etc but they have hear from somebody i know not whom that the beginning of a speech should be sober and grave and least give to noise and therefore they begin theirs at that rate they can scarce hear themselves a if it be not matter whether anyone understand them they have learn somewhere that to move the affection a louder voice be requisite whereupon they that otherwise would speak like a mouse in a cheese start out of a sudden into a downright fury even there too where theres the least need of it a man would swear they be past the power of hellebore so little do they consider where ti they run out again because they have hear that a a speech come up to something a man should press it more earnestly they however they begin use a strange contention of voice in every part though the matter itself be never so flat and end in that manner a if theyd run themselves out of breath lastly they have learn that among rhetorician there be some mention of laughter and therefore they study to prick in a jest here and there but o venus so void of wit and so little to the purpose that it may be truly call an ass playing on the harp and sometimes also they use somewhat of a sting but so nevertheless that they rather tickle than wound nor do they ever more truly flat than when they would seem to use the great freedom of speech lastly such be their whole action that a man would swear they have learn it from our common tumbler though yet they come short of them in every respect however they be both so like that no man will dispute but that either these learn their rhetoric from them or they theirs from these and yet they light on some that when they hear them conceive they hear very demosthenes and cicero of which sort chiefly be our merchant and woman whose ear only they endeavor to please because a to the first if they stroke them handsomely some part or other of their illgotten good be wont to fall to their share and the woman though for many other thing they favor this order this be not the least that they commit to their breast whatever discontent they have against their husband and now i conceive me you see how much this kind of people be behold to me that with their petty ceremony ridiculous trifle and noise exercise a kind of tyranny among mankind believe themselves very paul and anthony but i willingly give over these stageplayers that be such ingrateful dissembler of the courtesy i have do them and such impudent pretender to religion which they havent and now i have a mind to give some small touch of prince and court of whom i be have in reverence aboveboard and a it become gentleman frankly and truly if they have the least proportion of sound judgment what life be more unpleasant than theirs or so much to be avoid for whoever do but truly weigh with himself how great a burden lie upon hi shoulder that would truly discharge the duty of a prince he would not think it worth hi while to make hi way to a crown by perjury and parricide he would consider that he that take a scepter in hi hand should manage the public not hi private interest study nothing but the common good and not in the least go contrary to those law whereof himself be both the author and exactor that he be to take an account of the good or evil administration of all hi magistrate and subordinate officer that though he be but one all men eye be upon him and in hi power it be either like a good planet to give life and safety to mankind by hi harmless influence or like a fatal comet to send mischief and destruction that the vice of other men be not alike felt nor so generally communicate and that a prince stand in that place that hi least deviation from the rule of honesty and honor reach farther than himself and open a gap to many men ruin besides that the fortune of prince have many thing attend it that be but too apt to train them out of the way a pleasure liberty flattery excess for which cause he should the more diligently endeavor and set a watch over himself l perhaps he be lead aside and fail in hi duty lastly to say nothing of treason ill will and such other mischief he in jeopardy of that that true king be over hi head who in a short time will call him to account for every the least trespass and that so much the more severely by how much more mighty be the empire commit to hi charge these and the like if a prince should duly weigh and weigh it he would if he be wise he would neither be able to sleep nor take any hearty repast but now by my courtesy they leave all this care to the god and be only take up with themselves not admit anyone to their ear but such a know how to speak pleasant thing and not trouble them with business they believe they have discharge all the duty of a prince if they hunt every day keep a stable of fine horse sell dignity and commandery and invent new way of drain the citizen purse and bring it into their own exchequer but under such dainty newfound name that though the thing be most unjust in itself it carry yet some face of equity add to this some little sweetnings that whatever happen they may be secure of the common people and now suppose someone such a they sometimes be a man ignorant of law little less than an enemy to the public good and mind nothing but hi own give up to pleasure a hater of learn liberty and justice study nothing less than the public safety but measure everything by hi own will and profit and then put on him a golden chain that declare the accord of all virtue link one to another a crown set with diamond that should put him in mind how he ought to excel all other in heroic virtue besides a scepter the emblem of justice and an untainted heart and lastly a purple robe a badge of that charity he owe the commonwealth all which if a prince should compare them with hi own life he would i believe be clearly ashamed of hi bravery and be afraid l some or other gibe expounder turn all this tragical furniture into a ridiculous laughingstock and a to the court lord what should i mention them than most of whom though there be nothing more indebted more servile more witless more contemptible yet they would seem a they be the most excellent of all other and yet in this only thing no men more modest in that they be content to wear about them gold jewel purple and those other mark of virtue and wisdom but for the study of the thing themselves they remit it to other think it happiness enough for them that they can call the king master have learn the cringe la mode know when and where to use those title of your grace my lord your magnificence in a word that they be past all shame and can flatter pleasantly for these be the art that speak a man truly noble and an exact courtier but if you look into their manner of life youll find them mere sots as debauch a penelope wooer you know the other part of the verse which the echo will better tell you than i can they sleep till noon and have their mercenary levite come to their bedside where he chop over hi matins before they be half up then to breakfast which be scarce do but dinner stay for them from thence they go to dice table card or entertain themselves with jester fool gambol and horse trick in the meantime they have one or two beverage and then supper and after that a banquet and twere well by jupiter there be no more than one and in this manner do their hour day month year age slide away without the least irksomeness nay i have sometimes go away many inch fatter to see them speak big word while each of the lady believe herself so much nearer to the god by how much the longer train she trails after her while one nobleman edge out another that he may get the nearer to jupiter himself and everyone of them please himself the more by how much more massive be the chain he swag on hi shoulder a if he mean to show hi strength as well a hi wealth nor be prince by themselves in their manner of life since pope cardinal and bishop have so diligently follow their step that theyve almost get the start of them for if any of them would consider what their alb should put them in mind of to wit a blameless life what be mean by their forked miter whose each point be hold in by the same knot well suppose it a perfect knowledge of the old and new testament what those glove on their hand but a sincere administration of the sacrament and free from all touch of worldly business what their crosier but a careful look after the flock commit to their charge what the cross bear before them but victory over all earthly affectionsthese i say and many of the like kind should anyone truly consider would he not live a sad and troublesome life whereas now they do well enough while they fee themselves only and for the care of their flock either put it over to christ or lay it all on their suffragan a they call them or some poor vicar nor do they so much a remember their name or what the word bishop signifies to wit labor care and trouble but in rack to gather money they truly act the part of bishop and herein acquit themselves to be no blind seer in like manner cardinal if they think themselves the successor of the apostle they would likewise imagine that the same thing the other do be require of them and that they be not lord but dispenser of spiritual thing of which they must shortly give an exact account but if they also would a little philosophize on their habit and think with themselves whats the meaning of their linen rochet be it not a remarkable and singular integrity of life what that inner purple be it not an earnest and fervent love of god or what that outward whose loose plait and long train fall round hi reverence mule and be large enough to cover a camel be it not charity that spread itself so wide to the succor of all men that be to instruct exhort comfort reprehend admonish compose war resist wicked prince and willingly expend not only their wealth but their very live for the flock of christ though yet what need at all of wealth to them that supply the room of the poor apostle these thing i say do they but duly consider they would not be so ambitious of that dignity or if they be they would willingly leave it and live a laborious careful life such a be that of the ancient apostle and for pope that supply the place of christ if they should endeavor to imitate hi life to wit hi poverty labor doctrine cross and contempt of life or should they consider what the name pope that be father or holiness import who would live more disconsolate than themselves or who would purchase that chair with all hi substance or defend it so purchase with sword poison and all force imaginable so great a profit would the access of wisdom deprive him ofwisdom do i say nay the least corn of that salt which christ speaks of so much wealth so much honor so much rich so many victory so many office so many dispensation so much tribute so many pardon such horse such mule such guard and so much pleasure would it lose them you see how much i have comprehend in a little instead of which it would bring in watching fasting tear prayer sermon good endeavor sigh and a thousand the like troublesome exercise nor be this least considerable so many scribe so many copy clerk so many notary so many advocate so many promoter so many secretary so many muleteer so many groom so many banker in short that vast multitude of men that overcharge the roman seei mistook i mean honormight beg their bread a most inhuman and economical thing and more to be execrate that those great prince of the church and true light of the world should be reduce to a staff and a wallet whereas now if there be anything that require their pain they leave that to peter and paul that have leisure enough but if there be anything of honor or pleasure they take that to themselves by which mean it be yet by my courtesy that scarce any kind of men live more voluptuously or with less trouble a believing that christ will be well enough pleased if in their mystical and almost mimic pontificality ceremony title of holiness and the like and blessing and cursing they play the part of bishop to work miracle be old and antiquate and not in fashion now to instruct the people troublesome to interpret the scripture pedantic to pray a sign one have little els to do to shed tear silly and womanish to be poor base to be vanquish dishonorable and little become him that scarce admits even king to kiss hi slipper and lastly to die uncouth and to be stretch on a cross infamous theirs be only those weapon and sweet blessing which paul mention and of these truly they be bountiful enough a interdiction hanging heavy burden reproof anathemas execution in effigy and that terrible thunderbolt of excommunication with the very sight of which they sink men souls beneath the bottom of hell which yet these most holy father in christ and hi vicar hurl with more fierceness against none than against such a by the instigation of the devil attempt to lessen or rob them of peter patrimony when though those word in the gospel we have leave all and follow thee be hi yet they call hi patrimony land city tribute impost rich for which be enflamed with the love of christ they contend with fire and sword and not without loss of much christian blood and believe they have then most apostolically defend the church the spouse of christ when the enemy a they call them be valiantly rout a if the church have any deadlier enemy than wicked prelate who not only suffer christ to run out of request for want of preach him but hinder hi spread by their multitude of law merely contrive for their own profit corrupt him by their forced exposition and murder him by the evil example of their pestilent life nay far whereas the church of christ be found in blood confirm by blood and augment by blood now a if christ who after hi wonted manner defend hi people be lose they govern all by the sword and whereas war be so savage a thing that it rather befit beast than men so outrageous that the very poet feign it come from the fury so pestilent that it corrupt all men manner so unjust that it be best execute by the bad of men so wicked that it have no agreement with christ and yet omit all the other they make this their only business here youll see decrepit old fellow act the part of young men neither trouble at their cost nor weary with their labor nor discourage at anything so they may have the liberty of turn law religion peace and all thing els quite topsyturvy nor be they destitute of their learned flatterer that call that palpable madness zeal piety and valor have find out a new way by which a man may kill hi brother without the least breach of that charity which by the command of christ one christian owe another and here in troth im a little at a stand whether the ecclesiastical german elector give them this example or rather take it from them who lay aside their habit benediction and all the like ceremony so act the part of commander that they think it a mean thing and least beseem a bishop to show the least courage to godward unless it be in a battle and a to the common herd of priest they account it a crime to degenerate from the sanctity of their prelate heidah how soldierlike they bustle about the jus divinum of title and how quicksighted they be to pick the least thing out of the writing of the ancient wherewith they may fright the common people and convince them if possible that more than a tenth be due yet in the meantime it least come in their head how many thing be everywhere extant concern that duty which they owe the people nor do their shorn crown in the least admonish them that a priest should be free from all worldly desire and think of nothing but heavenly thing whereas on the contrary these jolly fellow say they have sufficiently discharge their office if they but anyhow mumble over a few odd prayer which so help me hercules i wonder if any god either hear or understand since they do neither themselves especially when they thunder them out in that manner they be wont but this they have in common with those of the heathen that they be vigilant enough to the harvest of their profit nor be there any of them that be not well read in those law than the scripture whereas if there be anything burdensome they prudently lay that on other men shoulder and shift it from one to the other a men toss a ball from hand to hand follow herein the example of lay prince who commit the government of their kingdom to their grand minister and they again to other and leave all study of piety to the common people in like manner the common people put it over to those they call ecclesiastic a if themselves be no part of the church or that their vow in baptism have lose it obligation again the priest that call themselves secular a if they be initiate to the world not to christ lay the burden on the regular the regular on the monk the monk that have more liberty on those that have less and all of them on the mendicant the mendicant on the carthusian among whom if anywhere this piety lie bury but yet so close that scarce anyone can perceive it in like manner the pope the most diligent of all other in gathering in the harvest of money refer all their apostolical work to the bishop the bishop to the parson the parson to the vicar the vicar to their brother mendicant and they again throw back the care of the flock on those that take the wool but it be not my business to sift too narrowly the life of prelate and priest for fear i seem to have intend rather a satire than an oration and be think to tax good prince while i praise the bad and therefore what i slightly teach before have be to no other end but that it might appear that theres no man can live pleasantly unless he be initiate to my rite and have me propitious to him for how can it be otherwise when fortune the great directress of all human affair and myself be so all one that she be always an enemy to those wise men and on the contrary so favorable to fool and careless fellow that all thing hit luckily to them you have hear of that timotheus the most fortunate general of the athenian of whom come that proverb hi net catch fish though he be asleep and that the owl fly whereas these other hit properly wise men bear in the fourth month and again he rid sejanuss hi horse and gold of toulouse signify thereby the extremity of ill fortune but i forbear the further threading of proverbs l i seem to have pilfer my friend erasmus adages fortune love those that have least wit and most confidence and such a like that say of caesar the die be throw but wisdom make men bashful which be the reason that those wise men have so little to do unless it be with poverty hunger and chimney corner that they live such neglected unknown and hated life whereas fool abound in money have the chief command in the commonwealth and in a word flourish every way for if it be happiness to please prince and to be conversant among those golden and diamond god what be more unprofitable than wisdom or what be it these kind of men have may more justly be censure if wealth be to be get how little good at it be that merchant like to do if follow the precept of wisdom he should boggle at perjury or be take in a lie blush or in the least regard the sad scruple of those wise men touch rapine and usury again if a man sue for honor or church preferment an as or wild ox shall sooner get them than a wise man if a man in love with a young wench none of the least humor in this comedy they be wholly addict to fool and be afraid of a wise man and fly him a they would a scorpion lastly whoever intend to live merry and frolic shut their door against wise men and admit anything sooner in brief go whither you will among prelate prince judge magistrate friend enemy from high to lowest and youll find all thing do by money which a a wise man condemn it so it take a special care not to come near him what shall i say there be no measure or end of my praise and yet tis fit my oration have an end and therefore ill even break off and yet before i do it twill not be amiss if i briefly show you that there have not be want even great author that have make me famous both by their writing and action lest perhaps otherwise i may seem to have foolishly please myself only or that the lawyer charge me that i have prove nothing after their example therefore will i allege my proof that be to say nothing to the point and first every man allow this proverb that where a man want matter he may best frame some and to this purpose be that verse which we teach child tis the great wisdom to know when and where to counterfeit the fool and now judge yourselves what an excellent thing this folly be whose very counterfeit and semblance only have get such praise from the learn but more candidly do that fat plump epicurean baconhog horace for so he call himself bid u mingle our purpose with folly and whereas he add the word bravem short perhaps to help out the verse he might as well have let it alone and again ti a pleasant thing to play the fool in the right season and in another place he have rather be account a dotterel and sot than to be wise and make mouth at and telemachus in homer whom the poet praise so much be now and then call nepios fool and by the same name a if there be some good fortune in it be the tragedian wont to call boy and stripling and what do that sacred book of iliad contain but a kind of counterscuffle between foolish king and foolish people besides how absolute be that praise that cicero give of it all thing be full of fool for who do not know that every good the more diffusive it be by so much the good it be but perhaps their authority may be of small credit among christian well therefore if you please support our praise with some testimony of holy writ also in the first place nevertheless have forespoke our theologian that theyll give u leave to do it without offense and in the next forasmuch a we attempt a matter of some difficulty and it may be perhaps a little too saucy to call back again the mus from helicon to so great a journey especially in a matter they be wholly stranger to it will be more suitable perhaps while i play the divine and make my way through such prickly quiddity that i entreat the soul of scotus a thing more bristly than either porcupine or hedgehog to leave hi scorebone awhile and come into my breast and then let him go whither he please or to the dog i could wish also that i might change my countenance or that i have on the square cap and the cassock for fear some or other should impeach me of theft a if i have privily rifle our master desks in that i have get so much divinity but it ought not to seem so strange if after so long and intimate an acquaintance and converse with them i have pick up somewhat when a that figtreegod priapus hear hi owner read certain greek word take so much notice of them that he get them by heart and that cock in lucian by have live long among men become at last a master of their language but to the point under a fortunate direction ecclesiastes say in hi first chapter the number of fool be infinite and when he call it infinite do he not seem to comprehend all men unless it be some few whom yet tis a question whether any man ever saw but more ingeniously do jeremiah in hi tenth chapter confess it say every man be make a fool through hi own wisdom attribute wisdom to god alone and leave folly to all men els and again let not man glory in hi wisdom and why good jeremiah would you not have a man glory in hi wisdom because hell say he have none at all but to return to ecclesiastes who when he cry out vanity of vanity all be vanity what other thought have he do you believe than that a i say before the life of man be nothing els but an interlude of folly in which he have add one voice more to that justly receive praise of cicero which i quote before viz all thing be full of fool again that wise preacher that say a fool change a the moon but a wise man be permanent a the sun what els do he hint at in it but that all mankind be fool and the name of wise only proper to god for by the moon interpreter understand human nature and by the sun god the only fountain of light with which agree that which christ himself in the gospel deny that anyone be to be call good but one and that be god and then if he be a fool that be not wise and every good man accord to the stoic be a wise man it be no wonder if all mankind be conclude under folly again solomon chapter 15 foolishness say he be joy to the fool thereby plainly confess that without folly there be no pleasure in life to which be pertinent that other he that increase knowledge increase grief and in much understanding there be much indignation and do he not plainly confess a much chapter 7 the heart of the wise be where sadness be but the heart of fool follow mirth by which you see he think it not enough to have learn wisdom without he have add the knowledge of me also and if you will not believe me take hi own word chapter 1 i give my heart to know wisdom and knowledge madness and folly where by the way ti worth your remark that he intend me somewhat extraordinary that he name me last a preacher write it and this you know be the order among churchman that he that be first in dignity come last in place a mindful no doubt whatever they do in other thing herein at least to observe the evangelical precept besides that folly be more excellent than wisdom the son of sirach whoever he be clearly witness chapter 44 whose word so help me hercules i shall not once utter before you meet my induction with a suitable answer accord to the manner of those in plato that dispute with socrates what thing be more proper to be lay up with care such a be rare and precious or such a be common and of no account why do you give me no answer well though you should dissemble the greek proverb will answer for you foul water be throw out of door which if any man shall be so ungracious a to condemn let him know ti aristotle the god of our master be there any of you so very a fool a to leave jewel and gold in the street in truth i think not in the most secret part of your house nor be that enough if there be any drawer in your iron chests more private than other there you lay them but dirt you throw out of door and therefore if you so carefully lay up such thing a you value and throw away whats vile and of no worth be it not plain that wisdom which he forbid a man to hide be of less account than folly which he command him to cover take hi own word better be the man that hideth hi folly than he that hideth hi wisdom or what be that when he attribute an upright mind without craft or malice to a fool when a wise man the while think no man like himself for so i understand that in hi tenth chapter a fool walking by the way be a fool himself suppose all men to be fool like him and be it not a sign of great integrity to esteem every man as good a himself and when there be no one that lean not too much to other way to be so frank yet a to divide hi praise with another nor be this great king ashamed of the name when he say of himself that he be more foolish than any man nor do paul that great doctor of the gentile write to the corinthian unwillingly acknowledge it i speak say he like a fool i be more a if it could be any dishonor to excel in folly but here i meet with a great noise of some that endeavor to peck out the crow eye that be to blind the doctor of our time and smoke out their eye with new annotation among whom my friend erasmus whom for honor sake i often mention deserves if not the first place yet certainly the second o most foolish instance they cry and well become folly herself the apostle meaning be wide enough from what you dream for he speak it not in this sense that he would have them believe him a great fool than the rest but when he have say they be minister of christ the same be i and by way of boast herein have equal himself with to other he add this by way of correction or check himself i be more a meaning that he be not only equal to the rest of the apostle in the work of the gospel but somewhat superior and therefore while he would have this receive a a truth l nevertheless it might not relish their ear a be speak with too much arrogance he foreshorten hi argument with the vizard of folly i speak like a fool because he know it be the prerogative of fool to speak what they like and that too without offense whatever he think when he write this i leave it to them to discuss for my own part i follow those fat fleshy and vulgarly approve doctor with whom by jupiter a great part of the learn have rather err than follow them that understand the tongue though they be never so much in the right not any of them make great account of those smatter at greek than if they be daw especially when a no small professor whose name i wittingly conceal l those chough should chatter at me that greek proverb i have so often mention an as at a harp discourse magisterially and theologically on this text i speak a a fool i be more draw a new thesis and which without the height of logic he could never have do make this new subdivisionfor ill give you hi own word not only in form but matter alsoi speak like a fool that be if you look upon me a a fool for compare myself with those false apostle i shall seem yet a great fool by esteem myself before them though the same person a little after a forget himself run off to another matter but why do i thus staggeringly defend myself with one single instance a if it be not the common privilege of divine to stretch heaven that be holy writ like a cheverel and when there be many thing in st paul that thwart themselves which yet in their proper place do well enough if there be any credit to be give to st jerome that be master of five tongue such be that of hi at athens when have casually espy the inscription of that altar he wrest it into an argument to prove the christian faith and leave out all the other word because they make against him take notice only of the two last viz to the unknown god and those too not without some alteration for the whole inscription be thus to the god of asia europe and africa to the unknown and strange god and accord to hi example do the son of the prophet who force out here and there four or five expression and if need be corrupt the sense wrest it to their own purpose though what go before and follow after make nothing to the matter in hand nay be quite against it which yet they do with so happy an impudence that oftentimes the civilian envy them that faculty for what be it in a manner they may not hope for success in when this great doctor i have almost bolt out hi name but that i once again stand in fear of the greek proverb have make a construction on an expression of luke so agreeable to the mind of christ a be fire and water to one another for when the last point of danger be at hand at which time retainer and dependent be wont in a more special manner to attend their protector to examine what strength they have and prepare for the encounter christ intending to take out of hi disciple mind all trust and confidence in such like defense demand of them whether they want anything when he send them forth so unprovided for a journey that they have neither shoe to defend their foot from the injury of stone and briar nor the provision of a scrip to preserve them from hunger and when they have deny that they want anything he add but now he that hath a bag let him take it and likewise a scrip and he that hath none let him sell hi coat and buy a sword and now when the sum of all that christ teach press only meekness suffering and contempt of life who do not clearly perceive what he mean in this place to wit that he might the more disarm hi minister that neglect not only shoe and scrip but throw away their very coat they might be in a manner naked the more readily and with less hindrance take in hand the work of the gospel and provide themselves of nothing but a sword not such a thief and murderer go up and down with but the sword of the spirit that pierce the most inward part and so cut off a it be at one blow all earthly affection that they mind nothing but their duty to god but see i pray whither this famous theologian wrests it by the sword he interpret defense against persecution and by the bag sufficient provision to carry it on a if christ have alter hi mind in that he send out hi disciple not so royally attend a he should have do repent himself of hi former instruction or a forgetting that he have say bless be ye when ye be evil spoken of despised and persecuted etc and forbid them to resist evil for that the meek in spirit not the proud be bless or l remember i say that he have compare them to sparrow and lily thereby mind them what small care they should take for the thing of this life be so far now from have them go forth without a sword that he command them to get one though with the sale of their coat and have rather they should go naked than want a brawlingiron by their side and to this a under the word sword he conceive to be comprehend whatever appertains to the repelling of injury so under that of scrip he take in whatever be necessary to the support of life and so do this deep interpreter of the divine meaning bring forth the apostle to preach the doctrine of a crucified christ but furnish at all point with lance sling quarterstaff and bombard lade them also with bag and baggage l perhaps it might not be lawful for them to leave their inn unless they be empty and fasting nor do he take the least notice of this that he so will the sword to be buy reprehend it a little after and command it to be sheathe and that it be never hear that the apostle ever use or sword or buckler against the gentile though ti likely they have do it if christ have ever intend a this doctor interpret there be another too whose name out of respect i pass by a man of no small repute who from those tent which habakkuk mention the tent of the land of midian shall tremble drew this exposition that it be prophesy of the skin of saint bartholomew who be flay alive and why forsooth but because those tent be cover with skin i be lately myself at a theological dispute for i be often there where when one be demand what authority there be in holy writ that command heretic to be convince by fire rather than reclaim by argument a crabbed old fellow and one whose supercilious gravity speak him at least a doctor answer in a great fume that saint paul have decree it who say reject him that be a heretic after once or twice admonition and when he have sundry time one after another thunder out the same thing and most men wonder what ail the man at last he explain it thus make two word of one a heretic must be put to death some laugh and yet there want not other to whom this exposition seem plainly theological which when some though those very few oppose they cut off the dispute a we say with a hatchet and the credit of so uncontrollable an author pray conceive me say he it be write thou shalt not suffer a witch to live but every heretic bewitch the people therefore etc and now as many a be present admire the man wit and consequently submit to hi decision of the question nor come it into any of their head that that law concern only fortunetellers enchanter and magician whom the hebrew call in their tongue mecaschephim witch or sorcerer for otherwise perhaps by the same reason it might as well have extend to fornication and drunkenness but i foolishly run on in these matter though yet there be so many of them that neither chrysippus nor didymus volume be large enough to contain them i would only desire you to consider this that if so great doctor may be allow this liberty you may the more reasonably pardon even me also a raw effeminate divine if i quote not everything so exactly a i should and so at last i return to paul ye willingly say he suffer my foolishness and again take me a a fool and further i speak it not after the lord but a it be foolishly and in another place we be fool for christ sake you have hear from how great an author how great praise of folly and to what other end but that without doubt he look upon it a that one thing both necessary and profitable if anyone among ye say he seem to be wise let him be a fool that he may be wise and in luke jesus call those two disciple with whom he join himself upon the way fool nor can i give you any reason why it should seem so strange when saint paul impute a kind of folly even to god himself the foolishness of god say he be wise than men though yet i must confess that origin upon the place deny that this foolishness may be resemble to the uncertain judgment of men of which kind be that the preaching of the cross be to them that perish foolishness but why be i so careful to no purpose that i thus run on to prove my matter by so many testimony when in those mystical psalm christ speak to the father say openly thou knowest my foolishness nor be it without ground that fool be so acceptable to god the reason perhaps may be this that a prince carry a suspicious eye upon those that be overwise and consequently hate themas caesar do brutus and cassius when he fear not in the least drunken antony so nero seneca and dionysius platoand on the contrary be delight in those blunter and unlabored wit in like manner christ ever abhors and condemn those wise men and such a put confidence in their own wisdom and this paul make clearly out when he say god hath choose the foolish thing of this world as well know it have be impossible to have reform it by wisdom which also he sufficiently declare himself cry out by the mouth of hi prophet i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and cast away the understanding of the prudent and again when christ give him thanks that he have conceal the mystery of salvation from the wise but reveal it to babes and suckling that be to say fool for the greek word for babe be fools which he oppose to the word wise men to this appertain that throughout the gospel you find him ever accuse the scribe and pharisee and doctor of the law but diligently defend the ignorant multitude for what other be that woe to ye scribe and pharisee than woe to you you wise men but seem chiefly delight in little child woman and fisher besides among brute beast he be best pleased with those that have least in them of the fox subtlety and therefore he choose rather to ride upon an as when if he have please he might have bestride the lion without danger and the holy ghost come down in the shape of a dove not of an eagle or kite add to this that in scripture there be frequent mention of hart hind and lamb and such a be destine to eternal life be call sheep than which creature there be not anything more foolish if we may believe that proverb of aristotle sheepish manner which he tell u be take from the foolishness of that creature and be use to be apply to dullheaded people and lackwits and yet christ profess to be the shepherd of this flock and be himself delighted with the name of a lamb accord to saint john behold the lamb of god of which also there be much mention in the revelation and what do all this drive at but that all mankind be foolsnay even the very best and christ himself that he might the good relieve this folly be the wisdom of the father yet in some manner become a fool when take upon him the nature of man he be find in shape a a man a in like manner he be make sin that he might heal sinner nor do he work this cure any other way than by the foolishness of the cross and a company of fat apostle not much good to whom also he carefully recommend folly but give them a caution against wisdom and draw them together by the example of little child lily mustardseed and sparrows thing senseless and inconsiderable live only by the dictate of nature and without either craft or care besides when he forbid them to be trouble about what they should say before governor and straightly charge them not to inquire after time and season to wit that they might not trust to their own wisdom but wholly depend on him and to the same purpose be it that that great architect of the world god give man an injunction against hi eating of the tree of knowledge a if knowledge be the bane of happiness accord to which also st paul disallow it a puff up and destructive whence also st bernard seem in my opinion to follow when he interpret that mountain whereon lucifer have fix hi habitation to be the mountain of knowledge nor perhaps ought i to omit this other argument that folly be so gracious above that her error be only pardoned those of wise men never whence it be that they that ask forgiveness though they offend never so wittingly cloak it yet with the excuse of folly so aaron in number if i mistake not the book when he sue unto moses concern hi sister leprosy i beseech thee my lord not to lay this sin upon u which we have foolishly commit so saul make hi excuse of david for behold say he i do it foolishly and again david himself thus sweeten god and therefore i beseech thee o lord to take away the trespass of thy servant for i have do foolishly a if he know there be no pardon to be obtain unless he have color hi offense with folly and ignorance and stronger be that of christ upon the cross when he pray for hi enemy father forgive them nor do he cover their crime with any other excuse than that of unwittingnessbecause say he they know not what they do in like manner paul writing to timothy but therefore i obtain mercy for that i do it ignorantly through unbelief and what be the meaning of i do it ignorantly but that i do it out of folly not malice and what of therefore i receive mercy but that i have not obtain it have i not be make more allowable through the covert of folly for u also make that mystical psalmist though i remember it not in it right place remember not the sin of my youth nor my ignorance you see what two thing he pretend to wit youth whose companion i ever be and ignorance and that in the plural number a number of multitude whereby we be to understand that there be no small company of them but not to run too far in that which be infinite to speak briefly all christian religion seem to have a kind of alliance with folly and in no respect to have any accord with wisdom of which if you expect proofs consider first that boys old men woman and fool be more delighted with religious and sacred thing than other and to that purpose be ever next the altar and this they do by mere impulse of nature and in the next place you see that those first founder of it be plain simple person and most bitter enemy of learn lastly there be no sort of fool seem more out of the way than be these whom the zeal of christian religion have once swallow up so that they waste their estate neglect injury suffer themselves to be cheat put no difference between friend and enemy abhor pleasure be cram with poverty watching tear labor reproach loathe life and wish death above all thing in short they seem senseless to common understanding a if their mind live elsewhere and not in their own body which what els be it than to be mad for which reason you must not think it so strange if the apostle seem to be drink with new wine and if paul appear to festus to be mad but now have once get on the lion skin go to and ill show you that this happiness of christian which they pursue with so much toil be nothing els but a kind of madness and folly far be it that my word should give any offense rather consider my matter and first the christian and platonist do as good a agree in this that the soul be plunge and fetter in the prison of the body by the grossness of which it be so tie up and hinder that it can not take a view of or enjoy thing a they truly be and for that cause their master defines philosophy to be a contemplation of death because it take off the mind from visible and corporeal object than which death do no more and therefore as long a the soul use the organ of the body in that right manner it ought so long it be say to be in good state and condition but when have break it fetter it endeavor to get loose and assay a it be a flight out of that prison that hold it in they call it madness and if this happen through any distemper or indisposition of the organ then by the common consent of every man ti downright madness and yet we see such kind of men foretell thing to come understand tongue and letter they never learn before and seem a it be big with a kind of divinity nor be it to be doubt but that it proceed from hence that the mind be somewhat at liberty from the infection of the body begin to put forth itself in it native vigor and i conceive ti from the same cause that the like often happen to sick men a little before their death that they discourse in strain above mortality a if they be inspire again if this happen upon the score of religion though perhaps it may not be the same kind of madness yet tis so near it that a great many men would judge it no well especially when a few inconsiderable people shall differ from the rest of the world in the whole course of their life and therefore it fare with them a accord to the fiction of plato happen to those that be coop up in a cave stand gap with admiration at the shadow of thing and that fugitive who have broke from them and return to them again tell them he have see thing truly a they be and that they be the most mistaken in believe there be nothing but pitiful shadow for a this wise man pity and bewail their palpable madness that be possess with so gross an error so they in return laugh at him a a doting fool and cast him out of their company in like manner the common sort of men chiefly admire those thing that be most corporeal and almost believe there be nothing beyond them whereas on the contrary these devout person by how much the nearer anything concern the body by so much more they neglect it and be wholly hurry away with the contemplation of thing invisible for the one give the first place to riches the next to their corporeal pleasure leave the last place to their soul which yet most of them do scarce believe because they cant see it with their eye on the contrary the other first rely wholly on god the most unchangeable of all thing and next him yet on this that come near him they bestow the second on their soul and lastly for their body they neglect that care and condemn and fly money a superfluity that may be well spar or if they be force to meddle with any of these thing they do it carelessly and much against their will have a if they have it not and possess a if they possess it not there be also in each several thing several degree wherein they disagree among themselves and first a to the sens though all of them have more or less affinity with the body yet of these some be more gross and blockish a taste hear see smell touch some more remove from the body a memory intellect and the will and therefore to which of these the mind apply itself in that lie it force but holy men because the whole bent of their mind be take up with those thing that be most repugnant to these grosser sense they seem brutish and stupid in the common use of them whereas on the contrary the ordinary sort of people be best at these and can do least at the other from whence it be a we have hear that some of these holy men have by mistake drunk oil for wine again in the affection of the mind some have a great commerce with the body than other a lust desire of meat and sleep anger pride envy with which holy men be at irreconcilable enmity and contrary the common people think theres no living without them and lastly there be certain middle kind of affection and a it be natural to every man a the love of one country child parent friend and to which the common people attribute no small matter whereas the other strive to pluck them out of their mind unless insomuch a they arrive to that high part of the soul that they love their parent not a parentsfor what do they get but the body though yet we owe it to god not thembut a good men or woman and in whom shin the image of that high wisdom which alone they call the chiefest good and out of which they say there be nothing to be beloved or desire and by the same rule do they measure all thing els so that they make less account of whatever be visible unless it be altogether contemptible than of those thing which they can not see but they say that in sacrament and other religious duty there be both body and spirit a in fast they count it not enough for a man to abstain from eat which the common people take for an absolute fast unless there be also a lessening of hi depraved affection a that he be less angry less proud than he be wont that the spirit be less clog with it bodily weight may be the more intent upon heavenly thing in like manner in the eucharist though say they it be not to be esteem the less that ti administer with ceremony yet of itself ti of little effect if not hurtful unless that which be spiritual be add to it to wit that which be represent under those visible sign now the death of christ be represent by it which all men vanquish abolishing and a it be bury their carnal affection ought to express in their life and conversation that they may grow up to a newness of life and be one with him and the same one among another this a holy man do and in this be hi only meditation whereas on the contrary the common people think theres no more in that sacrifice than to be present at the altar and crowd next it to have a noise of word and look upon the ceremony nor in this alone which we only propose by way of example but in all hi life and without hypocrisy do a holy man fly those thing that have any alliance with the body and be wholly ravish with thing eternal invisible and spiritual for which cause there so great contrarity of opinion between them and that too in everything that each party think the other out of their wit though that character in my judgment well agrees with those holy men than the common people which yet will be more clear if a i promise i briefly show you that that great reward they so much fancy be nothing els but a kind of madness and therefore suppose that plato dream of somewhat like it when he call the madness of lover the most happy condition of all other for he thats violently in love life not in hi own body but in the thing he love and by how much the farther he run from himself into another by so much the great be hi pleasure and then when the mind strive to rove from it body and do not rightly use it own organ without doubt you may say ti downright madness and not be mistake or otherwise whats the meaning of those common saying he do not dwell at home come to yourself he hi own man again besides the more perfect and true hi love be the more pleasant be hi madness and therefore what be that life hereafter after which these holy mind so pantingly breathe like to be to wit the spirit shall swallow up the body a conqueror and more durable and this it shall do with the great ease because heretofore in it lifetime it have cleanse and thin it into such another nothing a itself and then the spirit again shall be wonderfully swallow up by the high mind a be more powerful than infinite part so that the whole man be to be out of himself nor to be otherwise happy in any respect but that be strip of himself he shall participate of somewhat ineffable from that chief good that draw all thing into itself and this happiness though ti only then perfect when soul be join to their former body shall be make immortal yet forasmuch a the life of holy men be nothing but a continued meditation and a it be shadow of that life it so happen that at length they have some taste or relish of it which though it be but a the small drop in comparison of that fountain of eternal happiness yet it far surpass all worldly delight though all the pleasure of all mankind be all join together so much good be thing spiritual than thing corporeal and thing invisible than thing visible which doubtless be that which the prophet promise the eye hath not see nor the ear heard nor have it enter into the heart of man to consider what god have provide for them that love him and this be that mary good part which be not take away by change of life but perfect and therefore they that be sensible of it and few there be to whom this happen suffer a kind of somewhat little differ from madness for they utter many thing that do not hang together and that too not after the manner of men but make a kind of sound which they neither heed themselves nor be it understood by other and change the whole figure of their countenance one while jocund another while deject now weep then laugh and again sighing and when they come to themselves tell you they know not where they have be whether in the body or out of the body or sleep nor do they remember what they have hear see spoken or do and only know this a it be in a mist or dream that they be the most happy while they be so out of their wit and therefore they be sorry they be come to themselves again and desire nothing more than this kind of madness to be perpetually mad and this be a small taste of that future happiness but i forget myself and run beyond my bound though yet if i shall seem to have speak anything more boldly or impertinently than i ought be please to consider that not only folly but a woman say it remember in the meantime that greek proverb sometimes a fool may speak a word in season unless perhaps you expect an epilogue but give me leave to tell you you be mistake if you think i remember anything of what i have say have foolishly bolt out such a hodgepodge of word ti an old proverb i hate one that remember whats do over the cup this be a new one of my own making i hate a man that remember what he hear wherefore farewell clap your hand live and drink lustily my most excellent disciple of foll
