this be not a story when one tell a story it be for a listener and however short the story be it be highly unlikely that the teller be not occasionally interrupt by hi audience so i have introduce into the narration that will be read and which be not a story or which be a bad one if you have doubt about that a character that might approximate the role of the reader and i begin and you conclude right there that a subject this interesting must make u dizzy be the talk of the town for a month be phrase and rephrase until flavorless produce a thousand argument at least twenty leaflet and around a hundred bit of verse in favor or against in spite of all the finesse learning and pure grit of the author give that hi work have not lead to any violence it be mediocre very mediocre but it seem to me that we owe him a rather agreeable evening and that this reading have bring what a litany of wornout vignette fire from leave and right say just one single thing know for all eternity that man and woman be extraordinarily unfortunate beast nevertheless the epidemic have win you over and you have contribute just like any other whether or not it be to one taste it be only good taste to strike the tone give when meet company we customarily tidy up appearance at the door of the apartment for whomever we be see we pretend to be funny when we be sad sad when we would have like to be funny we do not want to appear out of place anywhere so the literary hack politicize the political pundit talk metaphysics the metaphysician moralize the moralist talk finance the financier letter or logic rather than listen or keep quiet each ramble on about what they be ignorant of and everyone bore each other with silly vanity or politeness you be in a bad mood i usually be and i think it be appropriate for me to reserve my vignette for a good time you mean you will wait for me to leave it be not that or you be afraid that i might have less indulgence for you face to face than i would for your average gentleman it be not that be agreeable then and tell me what it be that my vignette will not prove any good than those that have annoy you hmph tell it anyway no you have have enough you know that of all the way the other have enrage me yours be the most unpleasant and what be mine that of be ask to do the thing you be die to do well my friend i ask you i pray you satisfy yourself satisfy myself begin by god begin i will try to be short that can not hurt here a little out of spite i cough i spat i draw my handkerchief out slowly i blow my nose i open my snuff box i take out a pinch of snuff and i hear my fellow man say between hi teeth ` if the telling be short the preliminary be long i have the urge to call a servant under the pretext of some errand but i do not and i say it must be admit that there be very good men and very bad woman one see that every day and sometimes without leave the house go on go on i know an alsatian beauty beautiful enough to make old men come running and stop young one in their track i also know her her name be madame reymer that be correct a newcomer from nancy by the name of tani fell madly in love with her he be poor one of those lost child chase from the house by harsh parent with a large family throw into the world with no idea what will become of them know instinctually that there will never be a bad sort than the one they be flee from tani be infatuate with madame raymer consume by a passion that give him courage and ennoble all hi action in hi eye so that he willingly perform those most disturbing and vile to soothe the misery of hi soul during the day he would work the dock at even he beg in the street it be wonderful but it could not last tani sick of living on the brink or rather of keep a charm woman in poverty ever haunt by rich men urge her to rid herself of that beggar tani which she would have do fifteen day or a month later and to accept their rich decide to leave her and set out in search of fortune abroad he hunt around and win passage on one of the king ship it come time to depart he take leave of madame reymer ` my love he say to her ` i can no longer exploit your affection i have accept the inevitable i be leave ` you be leave ` yes ` and where be you go ` to the island you deserve something more and i can no longer come between you and it kindhearted tani ` and what be to become of me

whatever country on earth i find myself in you will know something terrible have befall me if a year go by without my bearing you witness of my tender attachment do not cry woman can cry on command ` and do not fight against plan that be in the end inspire by the reproach of my heart and from which they would not keep me and just like that tani leave for saintdomingue and just in time for madame reymer a for himself how would you know i know as well a anyone that when tani advise her to make a choice she make it well do continue your narration tani have a strong will and an entrepreneurial spirit he do not tarry in make himself know he join the sovereign council of the cape he distinguish himself by hi wisdom and equity he have no ambition to great fortune all he want be a quick and an honest one each year he send a portion of it to madame reymer he reach hi goal somewhere between nine and ten year no i do not believe he be absent any long than that to present hi lover with a small wallet contain the product of hi work and virtue and lucky for tani it be just at the moment when she have leave the last of hi successor the last yes so there be several assuredly go on go on but perhaps i have nothing leave to tell you that you do not already know good than i what do it matter go on anyway madame reymer and tani occupy a rather pretty build on rue saint marguerite at my doorstep i take a great liking to tani and frequent hi house which be if not opulent at least luxurious i can assure you without have do reymers accounting that she have an income of over pound before tani return and she keep it from him yes why would she she be greedy and predatory i could see predatory but greedy a greedy courtesan these two lover have live in perfect harmony for five or six year thanks to the shrewdness of the one and the unconditional confidence of the other ah it be true that it would have be impossible for the shadow of a doubt to enter a soul as pure a tanis the one thing i do occasionally notice be that madame reymer quickly forget her original poverty be torment by her love of wealth and splendor be humiliate that so beautiful a woman have travel on foot that she have not go by coach and the spark of vice bring out the bad in her you laugh it be then that m de maurepas hatch the plan to build a market up north the success of the enterprise demand a lively and intelligent man he have hi eye on tani to whom he have entrust the direction of many important business venture while he be at the cape which be always carry out to the satisfaction of the minister tani be upset by this mark of distinction he be so content so happy with hi girl he love he be or he think himself love well say what could gold possibly add to hi good fortune nothing but the minister insist he have to strengthen hi resolve he have to tell madame reymer i arrive at hi quarter right at the end of this unfortunate episode poor tani be collapse in tear ` what be the matter my friend i ask him between sob he tell me ` it be this woman madame reymer be work calmly at a tapestry tani rise brusquely and leave i stay behind with hi lover who do not allow me to remain ignorant of what she think of tanis irrationality she exaggerate the severity of her financial state she adorn her appeal with all the art that a cunning mind like hers know to compensate for the sophism of ambition ` what do it amount to an absence of two or three year at most ` that be some time for a man that you love and who love you as much a he do ` he love me if he love me would he hesitate to satisfy me ` but madame will you not go with him ` me i will not go and as eccentric a he be he have not even suggest it to me doe he have doubt about me ` i do not believe so not at all ` after await

everything that she have do for you and the state that you see her in ` what she do for me by god he be fully acquit by the loss of my time ` oh monsieur gardeil what a comparison between your time and all the priceless thing that you have take from her ` i have do nothing i be nothing i be thirty year old it be time to think of myself now or never and to treat all this nonsense like it be worth meanwhile the poor woman be come to a little bit at these last word she regain enough energy ` what do he say about the loss of hi time i learn four language to ease hi workload i read a thousand volume i write translate copied day and night i exhaust myself wear out my eye boil my blood i come down with an awful illness from which i may never recover he do not dare tell you the cause of hi displeasure but you will see at that instant she pull out her handkerchief withdraw one of her arm from her dress bar one of her shoulder and show me an erysipelatus mark ` the reason for hi transformation there it be she say to me ` there it be there be the effect of those sleepless night it come one morning with these roll of parchment m dhrouville he tell me be very anxious to know what be in these this work have to be do by tomorrow and it be at that moment we hear someone step come towards the door it be a servant announce m dhrouvilles arrival gardeils face go pale i invite

u leave now for i can neither answer for what i would do nor for what i would say in the blink of an eye mademoiselle de la chaux have repair the disorder this scene have make of her clothes and race from of gardeils office i follow and hear the door slam shut behind her i later learn that someone have give notice to the porter i conduct myself to her quarter where i find doctor le camus wait for u the passion that he felt for this young woman differ little from hers for gardeil i recount our visit to him and while i speak the sign of hi anger pain indignation it be not too difficult to see from hi face that your failure do not displease him all that much it be true there be man for you he be no good than that this rupture be follow by a violent sickness during which time the good honest tender and kind doctor give her such a treatment he would not have reserve for the noble woman in france he come three four time a day in spite of the peril he sleep in her room on a canvasstrap bed it be fortunate that this be only a disease of the heart in return to u she drift away from her memory of other and then she have a pretext to be trouble without indiscretion or constraint that think otherwise just do not apply to mademoiselle de la chaux during her recovery we sort out her schedule she have more than enough spirit imagination taste and knowledge to be admit into the acadmie de inscription she have listen to u wax metaphysical for so long that the most abstract matter have become familiar to her her first literary endeavor be the translation of hume essay on human understanding i proofread it and to tell you the truth she have leave me with very little to rectify this translation be print in holland and be well receive by the public my letter on the blind and the dumb appear at almost the same time she raise some very perceptive objection which give rise to an addition dedicate to her i have do bad thing than make this addition mademoiselle de la chauxs happiness have be somewhat restore the doctor cook for u occasionally and these dinner be not too sorrowful since gardeils estrangement le camus passion have make marvelous stride one day at the table during dessert a he be express it with all the honesty sensitivity and navet of a child she say to him with a sincerity that please me greatly but which will perhaps displease other ` doctor it would be impossible to heighten the respecti have for you your kindness fulfill me and i would be as gloomy a the monster of hyacinth street be i not steep in the fierce gratitude you tell me of your passion with such grace and sensitivity that i would be i think angry if you be to stop just the idea of lose your company or of be deprive of your friendship be enough to make me miserable you be a good man if there ever be one your goodness and sweetness of character be incomparable i do not believe that a heart can fall into good hand i appeal to my own from morning till night in your favor but appeal in vain to that which do not desire it i be not make any more progress meanwhile you will suffer and so i feel a vicious pain i do not know anyone more worthy of the happiness that you seek and i do not know what i would not do to make you happy anything be possible without exception i mean doctor i would yes i would go so far a to sleep so far a to include that do you want to sleep with me you only have to say so that be all i can do for you but you want to be love and i do not know a way the doctor listen to her take her by the hand and kiss it wet it with tear and i i do not know whether i should laugh or cry mademoiselle de la chaux know the doctor well the next day i say to her ` but mademoiselle if the doctor have say the word she answer ` i would have keep my promise but that would never have happen my offer be not of the sort that would be accept by a man like him ` why not it seem to me that if i be in hi position i would have simply hop that the rest would follow ` yes but if you be in hi position mademoiselle de la chaux would not have make you the same proposition the hume translation have not make her very much money the dutch will print anything provide they do not pay for it lucky for u given all the restriction we place on thought in our country if they even once decide to pay the author they would bring the entire book industry to their doorstep we advise her to write a light read one that would bring her more profit than respectshe work for four or five month at which point she bring me a short historical fiction entitle the three favorite it have a deftness of style finesse and earnestness but without her have realize it for she be incapable of any malice it be scatter with a multitude of detail applicable to the king mistress the marquise of pompadour and i do not conceal from her the fact that whatever the sacrifice whether it be in soften or remove these section it would be almost impossible for her work to appear without compromise her and that the unhappiness of spoil such a good thing would not guarantee her another she sense the truth in my observation and become only more distressed the good doctor predict all her need but she accept hi charity with all the more reservation a she felt herself less disposed to the sort of gratitude that he hop to receive from her besides the doctor be not wealthy then and he be not particularly in a position to become wealthy from time to time she take her manuscript from it folder and say to me sadly ` well there be no way to make anything of this it will have to remain there i give her some singular advice send the work as be without tone it down or alter it to madame de pompadour herself with a postscript explain the delivery this idea please her she write a charming letter on all count but most importantly with a tone of sincerity to which it would be impossible to say no two or three month pass with no word and she have deem the attempt fruitless until a saintlouis cross come to her home with a letter from the marquise the work be give the praise it merit she be thank for her sacrifice a market be acknowledge no offense be take and the author be invite to come to versailles where she would find a gracious woman dispose to give the help that depend on her a he be leave mademoiselle de la chauxs home the envoy leave a roll of fifty louis smoothly on her mantelpiece the doctor and i urge her to take advantage of madame de pompadour good will but we be work with a girl whose modesty and shyness match her merit how to present oneself there in rag the doctor raise this concern immediately after clothe there be other excuse and then still more the voyage to versailles be defer from day to day until it be almost inappropriate to go through with it it have already be some time since we have speak to her about it when the same emissary return with a second letter fill with the kindest reproach and another bonus offer with the same gentleness a the first this generous act of madame de pompadour have never be discover i speak of it to m collin her confidant and distributor of her secret favor he have not hear of it and i like to think that it be not the only one that her tomb contain it be thus that mademoiselle de la chaux twice miss the opportunity to pull herself from poverty she later move to the outskirt of the city and i entirely lose track of her from what i have learn of the remainder of her life she have become nothing but a fabric of grief infirmity and misery the door of her family be obstinately close to her in vain she solicit the intercession of the saintly folk that have persecute her with so much zeal accord to custom the doctor do not abandon her she die on straw in an attic while the little tiger on hyacinth street the only lover that she have have practice medicine in montpellier or toulouse and in the great comfort enjoy hi welldeserved reputation a a clever man and hi usurped reputation a a decent man but this be still more or less accord to custom if there be a good and honest tani providence send him to a reymer if there be a good and honest la chaux she will come to be share by a gardeil so that everything happens for the best one might answer that it be rash to make so definitive a pronouncement on the character of a man base on a single act that a rule so severe would reduce the number of good men on earth to less than the christian gospel admit a elect in heaven that one can be fickle in love even claim little devotion to woman without be deprive of honor or probity that one be in control neither of suppress a passion that flare up nor of prolong one that be end that there be already enough men in the street and house that be fully worthy of the name scoundrel without
