emile author preface this collection of scattered thought and observation have little order or continuity it be begin to give pleasure to a good mother who think for herself my first idea be to write a tract a few page long but i be carry away by my subject and before i know what i be do my tract have become a kind of book too large indeed for the matter contain in it but too small for the subject of which it treat for a long time i hesitate whether to publish it or not and i have often felt when at work upon it that it be one thing to publish a few pamphlet and another to write a book after vain attempt to improve it i have decide that it be my duty to publish it a it stand i consider that public attention require to be direct to this subject and even if my own idea be mistake my time will not have be waste if i stir up other to form right idea a solitary who cast hi writing before the public without any one to advertise them without any party ready to defend them one who do not even know what be think and say about those writing be at least free fromone anxietyif he be mistake no one will take hi error for gospel i shall say very little about the value of a good education nor shall i stop to prove that the customary method of education be bad this have be do again and again and i do not wish to fill my book with thing which everyone know i will merely state that go a far back a you will you will find a continual outcry against the establish method but no attempt to suggest a good the literature and science of our day tend rather to destroy than to build up we find fault after the manner of a master to suggest we must adopt another style a style less in accordance with the pride of the philosopher in spite of all those book whose only aim so they say be public utility the most useful of all art the art of train men be still neglect even after locke book be write the subject remain almost untouched and i fear that my book will leave it pretty much a it find it we know nothing of childhood and with our mistaken notion the further we advance the further we go astray the wise writer devote themselves to what a man ought to know without ask what a child be capable of learn they be always look for the man in the child without consider what he be before he become a man it be to this study that i have chiefly devote myself so that if my method be fanciful and unsound my observation may still be of service i may be greatly mistake a to what ought to be do but i think i have clearly perceive the material which be to be work upon begin thus by make a more careful study of your scholar for it be clear that you know nothing about them yet if you read this book with that end in view i think you will find that it be not entirely useless with regard to what will be call the systematic portion of the book which be nothing more than the course of nature it be here that the reader will probably go wrong and no doubt i shall be attack on this side and perhaps my critic may be right you will tell me this be not so much a treatise on education a the vision of a dreamer with regard to education what can i do i have not write about other people idea of education but about my own my thought be not those of other this reproach have be bring against me again and again but be it within my power to furnish myself with other eye or to adopt other idea it be within my power to refuse to be wed to my own opinion and to refuse to think myself wise than other i can not change my mind i can distrust myself this be all i can do and this i have do if i sometimes adopt a confident tone it be not to impress the reader it be to make my meaning plain to him why should i profess to suggest a doubtful that which be not a matter of doubt to myself i say just what i think when i freely express my opinion i have so little idea of claim authority that i always give my reason so that you may weigh and judge them for yourselves but though i would not obstinately defend my idea i think it my duty to put them forward for the principle with regard to which i differ fromother writer be not matter of indifference we must know whether they be true or false for on them depend the happiness or the misery of mankind people be always tell me to make practicable suggestion you might as well tell me to suggest what people be do already or at least to suggest improvement which may be incorporate with the wrong method at present in use there be matter with regard to which such a suggestion be far more chimerical than my own for in such a connection the good be corrupt and the bad be none the good for it i would rather follow exactly the establish method than adopt a good method by half there would be few contradiction in the man he can not aim at one and the same time at two different object father and mother what you desire that you can do may i count on your goodwill there be two thing to be consider with regard to any scheme in the first place be it good in itself in the second can it be easily put into practice with regard to the first of these it be enough that the scheme should be intelligible and feasible in itself that what be good in it should be adapt to the nature of thing in this case for example that the propose method of education should be suitable to man and adapt to the human heart the second consideration depend upon certain give condition in particular case these condition be accidental and therefore variable they may vary indefinitely thus one kind of education would be possible in switzerland and not in france another would be adapt to the middle class but not to the nobility the scheme can be carry out with more or less success accord to a multitude of circumstance and it result can only be determine by it special application to one country or another to this class or that now all these particular application be not essential to my subject and they form no part of my scheme it be enough for me that wherever men be bear into the world my suggestion with regard to them may be carry out and when you have make them what i would have them be you have do what be best for them and best for other people if i fail to fulfil this promise no doubt i be to blame but if i fulfil my promise it be your own fault if you ask anything more of me for i have promise you nothing more god make all thing good man meddles with them and they become evil he force one soil to yield the product of another one tree to bear anothers fruit he confuse and confounds time place and natural condition he mutilate hi dog hi horse and hi slave he destroy and deface all thing he love all that be deform and monstrous he will have nothing a nature make it not even man himself who must learn hi pace like a saddlehorse and be shape to hi master taste like the tree in hi garden yet thing would be bad without this education and mankind can not be make by half under exist condition a man leave to himself frombirth would be more of a monster than the rest prejudice authority necessity example all the social condition into which we be plunge would stifle nature in him and put nothing in her place she would be like a sapling chance sow in the midst of the highway bent hither and thither and soon crush by the passersby tender anxious mother footnote the early education be most important and it undoubtedly be womans work if the author of nature have mean to assign it to men he would have give them milk to fee the child address your treatise on education to the woman for not only be they able to watch over it more closely than men not only be their influence always predominant in education it success concern them more nearly for most widow be at the mercy of their child who show them very plainly whether their education be good or bad the law always more concerned about property than about people since their object be not virtue but peace the law give too little authority to the mother yet her position be more certain than that of the father her duty be more try the right ordering of the family depend more upon her and she be usually fond of her child there be occasion when a son may be excuse for lack of respect for hi father but if a child could be so unnatural a to fail in respect for the mother who bore him and nurse him at her breast who for so many year devote herself to hi care such a monstrous wretch should be smother at once a unworthy to live you say mother spoil their child and no doubt that be wrong but it be bad to deprave them a you do the mother want her child to be happy now she be right and if her method be wrong she must be teach a good ambition avarice tyranny the mistaken foresight of father their neglect their harshness be a hundredfold more harmful to the child than the blind affection of the mother moreover i must explain what i mean by a mother and that explanation follow i appeal to you you can remove this young tree fromthe highway and shield it fromthe crush force of social convention tend and water it ere it die one day it fruit will reward your care fromthe outset raise a wall round your child soul another may sketch the plan you alone should carry it into execution plant be fashion by cultivation man by education if a man be bear tall and strong hi size and strength would be of no good to him till he have learn to use them they would even harm him by prevent other fromcome to hi aid footnote like them in external but without speech and without the idea which be express by speech he would be unable to make hi want know while there would be nothing in hi appearance to suggest that he need their help leave to himself he would die of want before he know hi need we lament the helplessness of infancy we fail to perceive that the race would have perish have not man begin by be a child we be born weak we need strength helpless we need aid foolish we need reason all that we lack at birth all that we need when we come to man estate be the gift of education this education come to u fromnature frommen or fromthing the inner growth of our organ and faculty be the education of nature the use we learn to make of this growth be the education of men what we gain by our experience of our surroundings be the education of thing thus we be each taught by three master if their teaching conflict the scholar be illeducated and will never be at peace with himself if their teaching agree he go straight to hi goal he live at peace with himself he be welleducated now of these three factor in education nature be wholly beyond our control thing be only partly in our power the education of men be the only one control by u and even here our power be largely illusory for who can hope to direct every word and deed of all with whom the child have to do viewed a an art the success of education be almost impossible since the essential condition of success be beyond our control our effort may bring u within sight of the goal but fortune must favour u if we be to reach it what be this goal a we have just show it be the goal of nature since all three mode of education must work together the two that we can control must follow the lead of that which be beyond our control perhaps this word nature have too vague a meaning let u try to define it nature we be tell be merely habit what do that mean are there not habit form under compulsion habit which never stifle nature such for example be the habit of plant train horizontally the plant keep it artificial shape but the sap have not change it course and any new growth the plant may make will be vertical it be the same with a man disposition while the condition remain the same habit even the least natural of them hold good but change the condition habit vanish nature reassert herself education itself be but habit for be there not people who forget or lose their education and other who keep it whence come this difference if the term nature be to be restrict to habit conformable to nature we need say no more we be bear sensitive and fromour birth onwards we be affect in various way by our environment as soon a we become conscious of our sensation we tend to seek or shun the thing that cause them at first because they be pleasant or unpleasant then because they suit u or not and at last because of judgment form by mean of the idea of happiness and goodness which reason give u these tendency gain strength and permanence with the growth of reason but hinder by our habit they be more or less warp by our prejudice before this change they be what i call nature within u everything should therefore be bring into harmony with these natural tendency and that might well be if our three mode of education merely differ fromone another but what can be do when they conflict when instead of train man for himself you try to train him for other harmony become impossible forced to combat either nature or society you must make your choice between the man and the citizen you can not train both the small social group firmly unite in itself and dwell apart fromother tends to withdraw itself fromthe large society every patriot hat foreigner they be only men and nothing to himfootnote thus the war of republic be more cruel than those of monarchy but if the war of king be less cruel their peace be terrible well be their foe than their subject this defect be inevitable but of little importance the great thing be to be kind to our neighbour among stranger the spartan be selfish grasping and unjust but unselfishness justice and harmony rule hi home life distrust those cosmopolitan who search out remote duty in their book and neglect those that lie near such philosopher will love the tartar to avoid love their neighbour the natural man live for himself he be the unit the whole dependent only on himself and on hi like the citizen be but the numerator of a fraction whose value depend on it denominator hi value depend upon the whole that be on the community good social institution be those best fit to make a man unnatural to exchange hi independence for dependence to merge the unit in the group so that he no longer regard himself a one but a a part of the whole and be only conscious of the common life a citizen of rome be neither caius nor lucius he be a roman he ever love hi country well than hi life the captive regulus profess himself a carthaginian a a foreigner he refuse to take hi seat in the senate except at hi master bid he scorn the attempt to save hi life he have hi will and return in triumph to a cruel death there be no great likeness between regulus and the men of our own day the spartan pedaretes present himself for admission to the council of the three hundred and be reject he go away rejoice that there be three hundred spartan good than himself i suppose he be in earnest there be no reason to doubt it that be a citizen a spartan mother have five son with the army a helot arrive tremble she ask hi news your five son be slay vile slave be that what i ask thee we have win the victory she hasten to the temple to render thanks to the god that be a citizen he who would preserve the supremacy of natural feeling in social life know not what he ask ever at war with himself hesitate between hi wish and hi duty he will be neither a man nor a citizen he will be of no use to himself nor to other he will be a man of our day a frenchman an englishman one of the great middle class to be something to be himself and always at one with himself a man must act a he speak must know what course he ought to take and must follow that course with vigour and persistence when i meet this miracle it will be time enough to decide whether he be a man or a citizen or how he contrive to be both two conflict type of educational system spring fromthese conflict aim one be public and common to many the other private and domestic if you wish to know what be mean by public education read plato republic those who merely judge book by their title take this for a treatise on politics but it be the fine treatise on education ever write in popular estimation the platonic institute stand for all that be fanciful and unreal for my own part i should have think the system of lycurgus far more impracticable have he merely commit it to write plato only seek to purge man heart lycurgus turn it fromit natural course the public institute do not and can not exist for there be neither country nor patriot the very word should be strike out of our language the reason do not concern u at present so that though i know it i refrain fromstate it i do not consider our ridiculous college footnote there be teacher dear to me in many school and especially in the university of paris men for whom i have a great respect men whom i believe to be quite capable of instruct young people if they be not compel to follow the established custom i exhort one of them to publish the scheme of reform which he have think out perhaps people would at length seek to cure the evil if they realise that there be a remedy a public institute nor do i include under this head a fashionable education for this education face two way at once achieve nothing it be only fit to turn out hypocrite always profess to live for other while thinking of themselves alone these profession however deceive no one for every one have hi share in them they be so much labour waste our inner conflict be cause by these contradiction draw this way by nature and that way by man compel to yield to both force we make a compromise and reach neither goal we go through life struggling and hesitating and die before we have find peace useless alike to ourselves and to other there remain the education of the home or of nature but how will a man live with other if he be educate for himself alone if the twofold aim could be resolve into one by remove the man selfcontradictions one great obstacle to hi happiness would be go to judge of this you must see the man fullgrown you must have note hi inclination watch hi progress follow hi step in a word you must really know a natural man when you have read this work i think you will have make some progress in this inquiry what must be do to train this exceptional man we can do much but the chief thing be to prevent anything be do to sail against the wind we merely follow one tack and another to keep our position in a stormy sea we must cast anchor beware young pilot l your boat slip it cable or drag it anchor before you know it in the social order where each have hi own place a man must be educate for it if such a one leave hi own station he be fit for nothing els hi education be only useful when fate agree with hi parent choice if not education harm the scholar if only by the prejudice it have create in egypt where the son be compel to adopt hi father call education have at least a settled aim where social grade remain fixed but the men who form them be constantly change no one know whether he be not harm hi son by educate him for hi own class in the natural order men be all equal and their common call be that of manhood so that a welleducated man can not fail to do well in that call and those relate to it it matter little to me whether my pupil be intend for the army the church or the law before hi parent choose a call for him nature call him to be a man life be the trade i would teach him when he leave me i grant you he will be neither a magistrate a soldier nor a priest he will be a man all that become a man he will learn as quickly a another in vain will fate change hi station he will always be in hi right place occupavi te fortuna atque cepi omnesque aditus tuos interclusi ut ad me aspirare non posses the real object of our study be man and hi environment to my mind those of u who can best endure the good and evil of life be the best educated hence it follow that true education consist less in precept than in practice we begin to learn when we begin to live our education begin with ourselves our first teacher be our nurse the ancient use the word education in a different sense it mean nurture educit obstetrix say varro educat nutrix instituit paedagogus docet magister thus education discipline and instruction be three thing a different in their purpose a the dame the usher and the teacher but these distinction be undesirable and the child should only follow one guide we must therefore look at the general rather than the particular and consider our scholar a man in the abstract man expose to all the change and chance of mortal life if men be bear attach to the soil of our country if one season last all the year round if every man fortune be so firmly grasp that he could never lose it then the establish method of education would have certain advantage the child bring up to hi own call would never leave it he could never have to face the difficulty of any other condition but when we consider the fleeting nature of human affair the restless and uneasy spirit of our time when every generation overturn the work of it predecessor can we conceive a more senseless plan than to educate a child a if he would never leave hi room a if he would always have hi servant about him if the wretched creature take a single step up or down he be lose this be not teach him to bear pain it be train him to feel it people think only of preserve their child life this be not enough he must be teach to preserve hi own life when he be a man to bear the buffet of fortune to brave wealth and poverty to live at need among the snow of iceland or on the scorch rock of malta in vain you guard against death he must need die and even if you do not kill him with your precaution they be mistaken teach him to live rather than to avoid death life be not breath but action the use of our sens our mind our faculty every part of ourselves which make u conscious of our be life consist less in length of day than in the keen sense of live a man maybe bury at a hundred and may never have live at all he would have fare well have he die young our wisdom be slavish prejudice our custom consist in control constraint compulsion civilise man be bear and die a slave the infant be bind up in swaddle clothes the corpse be nail down in hi coffin all hi life long man be imprison by our institution i be tell that many midwife profess to improve the shape of the infant head by rub and they be allow to do it our head be not good enough a god make them they must be mould outside by the nurse and inside by the philosopher the carib be good off than we be the child have hardly leave the mother womb it have hardly begin to move and stretch it limb when it be deprive of it freedom it be wrap in swaddle band lay down with it head fix it leg stretch out and it arm by it side it be wound round with linen and bandage of all sort so that it can not move it be fortunate if it have room to breathe and it be lay on it side so that water which should flow fromit mouth can escape for it be not free to turn it head on one side for this purpose the newborn child require to stir and stretch hi limb to free them fromthe stiffness result frombe curl up so long hi limb be stretch indeed but he be not allow to move them even the head be confine by a cap one would think they be afraid the child should look a if it be alive thus the internal impulse which should lead to growth find an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the necessary movement the child exhaust hi strength in vain struggle or he gain strength very slowly he be freer and le constrain in the womb he have gain nothing by birth the inaction the constraint to which the child limb be subject can only check the circulation of the blood and humour it can only hinder the child growth in size and strength and injure it constitution where these absurd precaution be absent all the men be tall strong and wellmade where child be swaddle the country swarm with the humpbacked the lame the bowlegged the rickety and every kind of deformity in our fear l the body should become deform by free movement we hasten to deform it by put it in a press we make our child helpless l they should hurt themselves be not such a cruel bondage certain to affect both health and temper their first feeling be one of pain and suffering they find every necessary movement hamper more miserable than a galley slave in vain they struggle they become angry they cry their first word you say be tear that be so frombirth you be always check them your first gift be fetter your first treatment torture their voice alone be free why should they not raise it in complaint they cry because you be hurt them if you be swaddle you would cry loud still what be the origin of this senseless and unnatural custom since mother have despise their first duty and refuse to nurse their own child they have have to be entrust to hire nurse find themselves the mother of a stranger child without the tie of nature they have merely try to save themselves trouble a child unswaddled would need constant watch well swaddle it be cast into a corner and it cry be unheeded so long a the nurse negligence escape notice so long a the nursling do not break it arm or legs what matter if it die or become a weakling for life it limb be kept safe at the expense of it body and if anything go wrong it be not the nurse fault these gentle mother have get rid of their baby devote themselves gaily to the pleasure of the town do they know how their child be be treat in the village if the nurse be at all busy the child be hang up on a nail like a bundle of clothes and be leave crucify while the nurse go leisurely about her business child have be find in this position purple in the face their tightly bandage chest forbid the circulation of the blood and it go to the head so the sufferer be consider very quiet because he have not strength to cry how long a child might survive under such condition i do not know but it could not be long that i fancy be one of the chief advantage of swaddle clothes it be maintain that unswaddled infant would assume faulty position and make movement which might injure the proper development of their limb that be one of the empty argument of our false wisdom which have never be confirm by experience out of all the crowd of child who grow up with the full use of their limb among nation wise than ourselves you never find one who hurt himself or maim himself their movement be too feeble to be dangerous and when they assume an injurious position pain warn them to change it we have not yet decide to swaddle our kitten and puppy be they any the bad for this neglect child be heavy i admit but they be also weaker they can scarcely move how could they hurt themselves if you lay them on their back they will lie there till they die like the turtle unable to turn itself over not content with have cease to suckle their child woman no longer wish to do it with the natural result motherhood become a burden mean be find to avoid it they will destroy their work to begin it over again and they thus turn to the injury of the race the charm which be give them for it increase this practice with other cause of depopulation forbodes the come fate of europe her art and sciences her philosophy and moral will shortly reduce her to a desert she will be the home of wild beast and her inhabitant will hardly have change for the bad i have sometimes watch the trick of young wife who pretend that they wish to nurse their own child they take care to be dissuade fromthis whim they contrive that husband doctor and especially mother should intervene if a husband should let hi wife nurse her own baby it would be the ruin of him they would make him out a murderer who want to be rid of her a prudent husband must sacrifice paternal affection to domestic peace fortunately for you there be woman in the country district more continent than your wife you be still more fortunate if the time thus gain be not intend for another than yourself there can be no doubt about a wifes duty but consider the contempt in which it be hold it be doubtful whether it be not just as good for the child to be suckle by a stranger this be a question for the doctor to settle and in my opinion they have settle it accord to the woman wish footnote the league between the woman and the doctor have always strike me a one of the odd thing in paris the doctor reputation depend on the woman and by mean of the doctor the woman get their own way it be easy to see what qualifications a doctor require in paris if he be to become celebrated and for my own part i think it be well that the child should suck the breast of a healthy nurse rather than of a pet mother if he have any far evil to fear fromher who have give him birth ought the question however to be consider only fromthe physiological point of view doe not the child need a mother care as much a her milk other woman or even other animal may give him the milk she deny him but there be no substitute for a mother love the woman who nurse anothers child in place of her own be a bad mother how can she be a good nurse she may become one in time use will overcome nature but the child may perish a hundred time before hi nurse have develop a mother affection for him and this affection when developed have it drawback which should make any feeling woman afraid to put her child out to nurse is she prepare to divide her mother right or rather to abdicate them in favour of a stranger to see her child love another more than herself to feel that the affection he retain for hi own mother be a favour while hi love for hi fostermother be a duty for be not some affection due where there have be a mother care to remove this difficulty child be teach to look down on their nurse to treat them a mere servant when their task be complete the child be withdraw or the nurse be dismiss her visit to her fosterchild be discourage by a cold reception after a few year the child never see her again the mother expect to take her place and to repair by her cruelty the result of her own neglect but she be greatly mistaken she be make an ungrateful fosterchild not an affectionate son she be teach him ingratitude and she be prepare him to despise at a late day the mother who bore him a he now despise hi nurse how emphatically would i speak if it be not so hopeless to keep struggle in vain on behalf of a real reform more depends on this than you realise would you restore all men to their primal duty begin with the mother the result will surprise you every evil follow in the train of this first sin the whole moral order be disturbed nature be quench in every breast the home become gloomy the spectacle of a young family no longer stir the husband love and the stranger reverence the mother whose child be out of sight win scanty esteem there be no home life the tie of nature be not strengthen by those of habit father mother child brother and sister cease to exist they be almost stranger how should they love one another each think of himself first when the home be a gloomy solitude pleasure will be seek elsewhere but when mother deign to nurse their own child then will be a reform in moral natural feeling will revive in every heart there will be no lack of citizen for the state this first step by itself will restore mutual affection the charm of home be the best antidote to vice the noisy play of child which we think so try become a delight mother and father rely more on each other and grow dearer to one another the marriage tie be strengthen in the cheerful home life the mother find her sweet duty and the father hi pleasant recreation thus the cure of this one evil would work a widespread reformation nature would regain her right when woman become good mother men will be good husband and father my word be vain when we be sick of worldly pleasure we do not return to the pleasure of the home woman have cease to be mother they do not and will not return to their duty could they do it if they would the contrary custom be firmly establish each would have to overcome the opposition of her neighbour league together against the example which some have never give and other do not desire to follow yet there be still a few young woman of good natural disposition who refuse to be the slave of fashion and rebel against the clamour of other woman who fulfil the sweet task impose on them by nature would that the reward in store for them might draw other to follow their example my conclusion be base upon plain reason and upon fact i have never see dispute and i venture to promise these worthy mother the firm and steadfast affection of their husband and the truly filial love of their child and the respect of all the world childbirth will be easy and will leave no illresults their health will be strong and vigorous and they will see their daughter follow their example and find that example quote a a pattern to other no mother no child their duty be reciprocal and when ill do by the one they will be neglect by the other the child should love hi mother before he know what he owe her if the voice of instinct be not strengthen by habit it soon die the heart be stillborn fromthe outset we have stray fromthe path of nature there be another byway which may tempt our foot fromthe path of nature the mother may lavish excessive care on her child instead of neglect him she may make an idol of him she may develop and increase hi weakness to prevent him feel it she ward off every painful experience in the hope of withdraw him fromthe power of nature and fail to realise that for every trifling ill fromwhich she preserve him the future hold in store many accident and danger and that it be a cruel kindness to prolong the child weakness when the grown man must bear fatigue thetis so the story go plunge her son in the water of styx to make him invulnerable the truth of this allegory be apparent the cruel mother i speak of do otherwise they plunge their child into softness and they be prepare suffer for them they open the way to every kind of ill which their child will not fail to experience after they grow up fix your eye on nature follow the path trace by her she keep child at work she harden them by all kind of difficulty she soon teach them the meaning of pain and grief they cut their teeth and be feverish sharp colic bring on convulsion they be choke by fit of cough and torment by worm evil humour corrupt the blood germ of various kind ferment in it cause dangerous eruption sickness and danger play the chief part in infancy one half of the child who be bear die before their eighth year the child who have overcome hardship have gain strength and as soon a he can use hi life he hold it more securely this be natures law why contradict it do you not see that in your effort to improve upon her handiwork you be destroy it her care be waste to do fromwithout what she do within be accord to you to increase the danger twofold on the contrary it be the way to avert it experience show that child delicately nurture be more likely to die provided we do not overdo it there be less risk in use their strength than in spar it accustom them therefore to the hardship they will have to face train them to endure extreme of temperature climate and condition hunger thirst and weariness dip them in the water of styx before bodily habit become fix you may teach what habit you will without any risk but once habit be establish any change be fraught with peril a child will bear change which a man can not bear the muscle of the one be soft and flexible they take whatever direction you give them without any effort the muscle of the grown man be harder and they only change their accustomed mode of action when subject to violence so we can make a child strong without risk hi life or health and even if there be some risk it should not be take into consideration since human life be full of danger can we do good than face them at a time when they can do the least harm a child worth increase with hi year to hi personal value must be add the cost of the care bestow upon him for himself there be not only loss of life but the consciousness of death we must therefore think most of hi future in our effort for hi preservation he must be protect against the ill of youth before he reach them for if the value of life increase until the child reach an age when he can be useful what madness to spare some suffering in infancy only to multiply hi pain when he reach the age of reason be that what our master teach u man be bear to suffer pain be the mean of hi preservation hi childhood be happy know only pain of body these bodily suffering be much less cruel much less painful than other form of suffer and they rarely lead to selfdestruction it be not the twinge of gout which make a man kill himself it be mental suffer that lead to despair we pity the suffering of childhood we should pity ourselves our bad sorrow be of our own make the newborn infant cry hi early day be spend in cry he be alternately pet and shake by way of soothe him sometimes he be threaten sometimes beat to keep him quiet we do what he want or we make him do what we want we submit to hi whim or subject him to our own there be no middle course he must rule or obey thus hi early idea be those of the tyrant or the slave he command before he can speak he obeys before he can act and sometimes he be punish for fault before he be aware of them or rather before they be committed thus early be the seed of evil passion sow in hi young heart at a late day these be attribute to nature and when we have take pain to make him bad we lament hi badness in this way the child pass six or seven year in the hand of woman the victim of hi own caprice or theirs and after they have teach him all sort of thing when they have burden hi memory with word he can not understand or thing which be of no use to him when nature have be stifle by the passion they have implant in him this sham article be send to a tutor the tutor complete the development of the germ of artificiality which he find already well grown he teach him everything except selfknowledge and selfcontrol the art of life and happiness when at length this infant slave and tyrant cram with knowledge but empty of sense feeble alike in mind and body be flung upon the world and hi helplessness hi pride and hi other vice be display we begin to lament the wretchedness and perversity of mankind we be wrong this be the creature of our fantasy the natural man be cast in another mould would you keep him a nature make him watch over him fromhi birth take possession of him as soon a he come into the world and keep him till he be a man you will never succeed otherwise the real nurse be the mother and the real teacher be the father let them agree in the ordering of their duty as well a in their method let the child pas fromone to the other he will be well educate by a sensible though ignorant father than by the clever master in the world for zeal will atone for lack of knowledge rather than knowledge for lack of zeal but the duty of public and private business duty indeed do a father duty come last footnote when we read in plutarch that cato the censor who rule rome with such glory bring up hi own son fromthe cradle and so carefully that he leave everything to be present when their nurse that be to say their mother bath them when we read in suetonius that augustus the master of the world which he have conquer and which he himself govern himself teach hi grandson to write to swim to understand the beginning of science and that he always have them with him we can not help smile at the little people of those day who amuse themselves with such folly and who be too ignorant no doubt to attend to the great affair of the great people of our own time it be not surprising that the man whose wife despise the duty of suckle her child should despise it education there be no more charming picture than that of family life but when one feature be want the whole be mar if the mother be too delicate to nurse her child the father will be too busy to teach him their child scatter about in school convent and college will find the home of their affection elsewhere or rather they will form the habit of care for nothing brother and sister will scarcely know each other when they be together in company they will behave a stranger when there be no confidence between relation when the family society cease to give savour to life it place be soon usurped by vice is there any man so stupid that he can not see how all this hang together a father have do but a third of hi task when he beget child and provide a living for them he owe men to humanity citizen to the state a man who can pay this threefold debt and neglect to do so be guilty more guilty perhaps if he pay it in part than when he neglect it entirely he have no right to be a father if he can not fulfil a father duty poverty pressure of business mistake social prejudice none of these can excuse a man fromhi duty which be to support and educate hi own child if a man of any natural feeling neglect these sacred duty he will repent it with bitter tear and will never be comfort but what do this rich man do this father of a family compel so he say to neglect hi child he pay another man to perform those duty which be hi alone mercenary man do you expect to purchase a second father for your child do not deceive yourself it be not even a master you have hire for him it be a flunkey who will soon train such another a himself there be much discussion a to the characteristic of a good tutor my first requirement and it imply a good many more be that he should not take up hi task for reward there be calling so great that they can not be undertake for money without show our unfitness for them such calling be those of the soldier and the teacher but who must train my child i have just tell you you should do it yourself i can not you can not then find a friend i see no other course a tutor what a noble soul indeed for the training of a man one must either be a father or more than man it be this duty you would calmly hand over to a hireling the more you think of it the harder you will find it the tutor must have be train for hi pupil hi servant must have be train for their master so that all who come near him may have receive the impression which be to be transmit to him we must pass fromeducation to education i know not how far how can a child be well educate by one who have not be well educate himself can such a one be find i know not in this age of degradation who know the height of virtue to which man soul may attain but let u assume that this prodigy have be discover we shall learn what he should be fromthe consideration of hi duty i fancy the father who realise the value of a good tutor will contrive to do without one for it will be hard to find one than to become such a tutor himself he need search no further nature herself have do half the work some one whose rank alone be know to me suggest that i should educate hi son he do me a great honour no doubt but far fromregret my refusal he ought to congratulate himself on my prudence have the offer be accept and have i be mistake in my method there would have be an education ruin have i succeed thing would have be worsehis son would have renounce hi title and refuse to be a prince i feel too deeply the importance of a tutor duty and my own unfitness ever to accept such a post whoever offer it and even the claim of friendship would be only an additional motive for my refusal few i think will be tempt to make me such an offer when they have read this book and i beg any one who would do so to spare hi pain i have have enough experience of the task to convince myself of my own unfitness and my circumstance would make it impossible even if my talent be such a to fit me for it i have think it my duty to make this public declaration to those who apparently refuse to do me the honour of believe in the sincerity of my determination if i be unable to undertake the more useful task i will at least venture to attempt the easy one i will follow the example of my predecessor and take up not the task but my pen and instead of do the right thing i will try to say it i know that in such an undertake the author who range at will among theoretical system utters many fine precept impossible to practise and even when he say what be practicable it remain undone for want of detail and example a to it application i have therefore decide to take an imaginary pupil to assume on my own part the age health knowledge and talent require for the work of hi education to guide him frombirth to manhood when he need no guide but himself this method seem to me useful for an author who fear l he may stray fromthe practical to the visionary for as soon a he depart fromcommon practice he have only to try hi method on hi pupil he will soon know or the reader will know for him whether he be follow the development of the child and the natural growth of the human heart this be what i have try to do lest my book should be unduly bulky i have be content to state those principle the truth of which be selfevident but a to the rule which call for proof i have apply them to emile or to other and i have show in very great detail how my theory may be put into practice such at least be my plan the reader must decide whether i have succeed at first i have say little about emile for my early maxim of education though very different fromthose generally accept be so plain that it be hard for a man of sense to refuse to accept them but a i advance my scholar educate after another fashion than yours be no longer an ordinary child he need a special system then he appear upon the scene more frequently and towards the end i never lose sight of him for a moment until whatever he may say he need me no longer i pass over the quality require in a good tutor i take them for grant and assume that i be endow with them a you read this book you will see how generous i have be to myself i will only remark that contrary to the receive opinion a child tutor should be young a young indeed a a man may well be who be also wise were it possible he should become a child himself that he may be the companion of hi pupil and win hi confidence by share hi game childhood and age have too little in common for the formation of a really firm affection child sometimes flatter old men they never love them people seek a tutor who have already educate one pupil this be too much one man can only educate one pupil if two be essential to success what right would he have to undertake the first with more experience you may know good what to do but you be less capable of do it once this task have be well do you will know too much of it difficulty to attempt it a second timeif ill do the first attempt augur badly for the second it be one thing to follow a young man about for four year another to be hi guide for fiveandtwenty you find a tutor for your son when he be already form i want one for him before he be bear your man may change hi pupil every five year mine will never have but one pupil you distinguish between the teacher and the tutor another piece of folly do you make any distinction between the pupil and the scholar there be only one science for child to learnthe duty of man this science be one and whatever xenophon may say of the education of the persian it be indivisible besides i prefer to call the man who have this knowledge master rather than teacher since it be a question of guidance rather than instruction he must not give precept he must let the scholar find them out for himself if the master be to be so carefully choose he may well choose hi pupil above all when he propose to set a pattern for other this choice can not depend on the child genius or character a i adopt him before he be bear and they be only know when my task be finish if i have my choice i would take a child of ordinary mind such a i assume in my pupil it be ordinary people who have to be educate and their education alone can serve a a pattern for the education of their fellow the other find their way alone the birthplace be not a matter of indifference in the education of man it be only in temperate clime that he come to hi full growth the disadvantage of extreme be easily see a man be not plant in one place like a tree to stay there the rest of hi life and to pass fromone extreme to another you must travel twice as far a he who start halfway if the inhabitant of a temperate climate pass in turn through both extreme hi advantage be plain for although he may be change as much a he who go fromone extreme to the other he only remove halfway fromhi natural condition a frenchman can live in new guinea or in lapland but a negro can not live in tornea nor a samoyed in benin it seem also a if the brain be less perfectly organise in the two extreme neither the negro nor the lap be as wise a european so if i want my pupil to be a citizen of the world i will choose him in the temperate zone in france for example rather than elsewhere in the north with it barren soil men devour much food in the fertile south they eat little this produce another difference the one be industrious the other contemplative society show u in one and the same spot a similar difference between rich and poor the one dwells in a fertile land the other in a barren land the poor man have no need of education the education of hi own station in life be force upon him he can have no other the education receive by the rich man fromhi own station be least fitted for himself and for society moreover a natural education should fit a man for any position now it be more unreasonable to train a poor man for wealth than a rich man for poverty for in proportion to their number more rich men be ruin and few poor men become rich let u choose our scholar among the rich we shall at least have make another man the poor may come to manhood without our help for the same reason i should not be sorry if emile come of a good family he will be another victim snatch fromprejudice emile be an orphan no matter whether he have father or mother have undertake their duty i be invest with their right he must honour hi parent but he must obey me that be my first and only condition i must add that there be just one other point arise out of this we must never be separate except by mutual consent this clause be essential and i would have tutor and scholar so inseparable that they should regard their fate a one if once they perceive the time of their separation draw near the time which must make them stranger to one another they become stranger then and there each make hi own little world and both of them be busy in thought with the time when they will no longer be together they remain together against their will the disciple regard hi master a the badge and scourge of childhood the master regard hi scholar a a heavy burden which he long to be rid of both be look forward to the time when they will part and a there be never any real affection between them there will be scant vigilance on the one hand and on the other scant obedience but when they consider they must always live together they must need love one another and in this way they really learn to love one another the pupil be not ashamed to follow a a child the friend who will be with him in manhood the tutor take an interest in the effort whose fruit he will enjoy and the virtue he be cultivate in hi pupil form a store lay up for hi old age this agreement make beforehand assume a normal birth a strong wellmade healthy child a father have no choice and should have no preference within the limit of the family god have give him all hi child be hi alike the same care and affection be due to all crippled or wellmade weak or strong each of them be a trust for which he be responsible to the giver and nature be a party to the marriage contract along with husband and wife but if you undertake a duty not impose upon you by nature you must secure beforehand the mean for it fulfilment unless you would undertake duty you can not fulfil if you take the care of a sickly unhealthy child you be a sick nurse not a tutor to preserve a useless life you be waste the time which should be spend in increase it value you risk the sight of a despair mother reproach you for the death of her child who ought to have die long ago i would not undertake the care of a feeble sickly child should he live to four score year i want no pupil who be useless alike to himself and other one whose sole business be to keep himself alive one whose body be always a hindrance to the training of hi mind if i vainly lavish my care upon him what can i do but double the loss to society by rob it of two men instead of one let another tend this weakling for me i be quite willing i approve hi charity but i myself have no gift for such a task i could never teach the art of living to one who need all hi strength to keep himself alive the body must be strong enough to obey the mind a good servant must be strong i know that intemperance stimulate the passion in course of time it also destroy the body fasting and penance often produce the same result in an opposite way the weak the body the more imperious it demand the strong it be the good it obeys all sensual passion find their home in effeminate body the less satisfaction they can get the keen their sting a feeble body make a feeble mind hence the influence of physic an art which do more harm to man than all the evil it profess to cure i do not know what the doctor cure u of but i know this they infect u with very deadly disease cowardice timidity credulity the fear of death what matter if they make the dead walk we have no need of corps they fail to give u men and it be men we need medicine be all the fashion in these day and very naturally it be the amusement of the idle and unemployed who do not know what to do with their time and so spend it in take care of themselves if by illluck they have happen to be bear immortal they would have be the most miserable of men a life they could not lose would be of no value to them such men must have doctor to threaten and flatter them to give them the only pleasure they can enjoy the pleasure of not be dead i will say no more at present a to the uselessness of medicine my aim be to consider it bearing on moral still i can not refrain fromsay that men employ the same sophism about medicine a they do about the search for truth they assume that the patient be cure and that the seeker after truth find it they fail to see that against one life save by the doctor you must set a hundred slain and against the value of one truth discover the error which creep in with it the science which instruct and the medicine which heals be no doubt excellent but the science which mislead u and the medicine which kill u be evil teach u to know them apart that be the real difficulty if we be content to be ignorant of truth we should not be the dupe of falsehood if we do not want to be cure in spite of nature we should not be kill by the doctor we should do well to steer clear of both and we should evidently be the gainer i do not deny that medicine be useful to some men i assert that it be fatal to mankind you will tell me a usual that the doctor be to blame that medicine herself be infallible well and good then give u the medicine without the doctor for when we have both the blunder of the artist be a hundredfold great than our hope fromthe art this lie art invent rather for the ill of the mind than of the body be useless to both alike it do less to cure u of our disease than to fill u with alarm it do less to ward off death than to make u dread it approach it exhaust life rather than prolongs it should it even prolong life it would only be to the prejudice of the race since it make u set it precaution before society and our fear before our duty it be the knowledge of danger that make u afraid if we think ourselves invulnerable we should know no fear the poet arm achilles against danger and so rob him of the merit of courage on such term any man would be an achilles would you find a really brave man seek him where there be no doctor where the result of disease be unknown and where death be little thought of by nature a man bear pain bravely and die in peace it be the doctor with their rule the philosopher with their precept the priest with their exhortation who debase the heart and make u afraid to die give me a pupil who have no need of these or i will have nothing to do with him no one els shall spoil my work i will educate him myself or not at all that wise man locke who have devote part of hi life to the study of medicine advise u to give no drug to the child whether a a precaution or on account of slight ailment i will go far and will declare that a i never call in a doctor for myself i will never send for one for emile unless hi life be clearly in danger when the doctor can but kill him i know the doctor will make capital out of my delay if the child die he be call in too late if he recover it be hi do so be it let the doctor boast but do not call him in except in extremity a the child do not know how to be cure he know how to be ill the one art take the place of the other and be often more successful it be the art of nature when a beast be ill it keep quiet and suffers in silence but we see few sickly animal than sick men how many men have be slay by impatience fear anxiety and above all by medicine men whom disease would have spar and time alone have cure i shall be tell that animal who live accord to nature be less liable to disease than ourselves well that way of living be just what i mean to teach my pupil he should profit by it in the same way hygiene be the only useful part of medicine and hygiene be rather a virtue than a science temperance and industry be man true remedy work sharpen hi appetite and temperance teach him to control it to learn what system be most beneficial you have only to study those race remarkable for health strength and length of day if common observation show u that medicine neither increase health nor prolongs life it follow that this useless art be bad than useless since it waste time men and thing on what be pure loss not only must we deduct the time spend not in use life but preserve it but if this time be spend in torment ourselves it be bad than waste it be so much to the bad and to reckon fairly a corresponding share must be deduct fromwhat remain to u a man who live ten year for himself and other without the help of doctor live more for himself and other than one who spend thirty year a their victim i have try both so i think i have a good right than most to draw my own conclusion for these reason i decline to take any but a strong and healthy pupil and these be my principle for keep him in health i will not stop to prove at length the value of manual labour and bodily exercise for strengthen the health and constitution no one deny it nearly all the instance of long life be to be find among the men who have take most exercise who have endure fatigue and labour footnote i can not help quote the following passage froman english newspaper a it throw much light on my opinion a certain patrick oneil born in have just marry hi seventh wife in in the seventeenth year of charle he serve in the dragoon and in other regiment up to when he take hi discharge he serve in all the campaign of willia and marlborough this man have never drink anything but small beer he have always live on vegetable and have never eat meat except on few occasion when he make a feast for hi relation he have always be accustom to rise with the sun and go to bed at sunset unless prevent by hi military duty he be now in hi th year he be healthy hi hearing be good and he walk with the help of a stick in spite of hi great age he be never idle and every sunday he go to hi parish church accompany by hi child grandchild and great grandchild neither will i enter into detail a to the care i shall take for this alone it will be clear that it form such an essential part of my practice that it be enough to get hold of the idea without further explanation when our life begin our needs begin too the newborn infant must have a nurse if hi mother will do her duty so much the good her instruction will be give her in writing but this advantage have it drawback it remove the tutor fromhi charge but it be to be hop that the child own interest and her respect for the person to whom she be about to confide so precious a treasure will induce the mother to follow the master wish and whatever she do you may be sure she will do good than another if we must have a strange nurse make a good choice to begin with it be one of the misfortune of the rich to be cheat on all side what wonder they think ill of mankind it be rich that corrupt men and the rich be rightly the first to feel the defect of the only tool they know everything be illdone for them except what they do themselves and they do next to nothing when a nurse must be select the choice be leave to the doctor what happen the best nurse be the one who offer the high bribe i shall not consult the doctor about emile nurse i shall take care to choose her myself i may not argue about it so elegantly a the surgeon but i shall be more reliable i shall be less deceive by my zeal than the doctor by hi greed there be no mystery about this choice it rule be well know but i think we ought probably to pay more attention to the age of the milk as well a it quality the first milk be watery it must be almost an aperient to purge the remains of the meconium curdle in the bowel of the newborn child little by little the milk thickens and supply more solid food a the child be able to digest it it be surely not without cause that nature change the milk in the female of every specie accord to the age of the offspring thus a newborn child require a nurse who have recently become mother there be i know a difficulty here but as soon a we leave the path of nature there be difficulty in the way of all welldoing the wrong course be the only right one under the circumstance so we take it the nurse must be healthy alike in disposition and in body the violence of the passion as well a the humour may spoil her milk moreover to consider the body only be to keep only half our aim in view the milk may be good and the nurse bad a good character be as necessary a a good constitution if you choose a vicious person i do not say her fosterchild will acquire her vice but he will suffer for them ought she not to bestow on him day by day along with her milk a care which call for zeal patience gentleness and cleanliness if she be intemperate and greedy her milk will soon be spoil if she be careless and hasty what will become of a poor little wretch leave to her mercy and unable either to protect himself or to complain the wicked be never good for anything the choice be all the more important because her fosterchild should have no other guardian just a he should have no teacher but hi tutor this be the custom of the ancient who talk less but act more wisely than we the nurse never leave her fosterdaughter this be why the nurse be the confidante in most of their play a child who pass through many hand in turn can never be well bring up at every change he make a secret comparison which continually tend to lessen hi respect for those who control him and with it their authority over him if once he think there be grownup people with no more sense than child the authority of age be destroy and hi education be ruin a child should know no better but it father and mother or fail them it fostermother and it tutor and even this be one too many but this division be inevitable and the best that can be do in the way of remedy be that the man and woman who control him shall be so well agree with regard to him that they seem like one the nurse must live rather more comfortably she must have rather more substantial food but her whole way of living must not be alter for a sudden change even a change for the good be dangerous to health and since her usual way of life have make her healthy and strong why change it country woman eat less meat and more vegetable than townswomen and this vegetarian diet seem favourable rather than otherwise to themselves and their child when they take nursling fromthe upper class they eat meat and broth with the idea that they will form good chyle and supply more milk i do not hold with this at all and experience be on my side for we do not find child feed in this way less liable to colic and worm that need not surprise u for decay animal matter swarm with worm but this be not the case with vegetable matter footnote woman eat bread vegetable and dairy produce female dog and cat do the same the shewolves eat grass this supply vegetable juice to their milk there be still those specie which be unable to eat anything but flesh if such there be which i very much doubt milk although manufacture in the body of an animal be a vegetable substance this be show by analysis it readily turn acid and far fromshow trace of any volatile alkali like animal matter it give a neutral salt like plant the milk of herbivorous creature be sweet and more wholesome than the milk of the carnivorous formed of a substance similar to it own it keep it goodness and become less liable to putrifaction if quantity be consider it be well know that farinaceous food produce more blood than meat so they ought to yield more milk if a child be not wean too soon and if it be feed on vegetarian food and it fostermother be a vegetarian i do not think it would be trouble with worm milk derive fromvegetable food may perhaps be more liable to go sour but i be far fromconsider sour milk an unwholesome food whole nation have no other food and be none the bad and all the array of absorbent seem to me mere humbug there be constitution which do not thrive on milk other can take it without absorbent people be afraid of the milk separating or curdling that be absurd for we know that milk always curdle in the stomach this be how it become sufficiently solid to nourish child and young animal if it do not curdle it would merely pass away without feed them footnote although the juice which nourish u be liquid they must be extract fromsolid a hardworking man who eat nothing but soup would soon waste away he would be far good feed on milk just because it curdle in vain you dilute milk and use absorbent whoever swallow milk digest cheese this rule be without exception rennet be make froma calfs stomach instead of change the nurse usual diet i think it would be enough to give food in large quantity and good of it kind it be not the nature of the food that make a vegetable diet indigestible but the flavouring that make it unwholesome reform your cookery use neither butter nor oil for fry butter salt and milk should never be cook let your vegetable be cook in water and only season when they come to table the vegetable diet far fromdisturb the nurse will give her a plentiful supply of milk footnote those who wish to study a full account of the advantage and disadvantage of the pythagorean regime may consult the work of dr cocchi and hi opponent dr bianchi on this important subject if a vegetable diet be best for the child how can meat food be best for hi nurse the thing be contradictory fresh air affect children constitution particularly in early year it enter every pore of a soft and tender skin it have a powerful effect on their young body it effect can never be destroy so i should not agree with those who take a country woman fromher village and shut her up in one room in a town and her nursling with her i would rather send him to breathe the fresh air of the country than the foul air of the town he will take hi new mother position will live in her cottage where hi tutor will follow him the reader will bear in mind that this tutor be not a pay servant but the father friend but if this friend can not be find if this transfer be not easy if none of my advice can be follow you will say to me what shall i do instead i have tell you alreadydo what you be do no advice be need there men be not make to be crowd together in anthill but scatter over the earth to till it the more they be mass together the more corrupt they become disease and vice be the sure result of overcrowded city of all creature man be least fitted to live in herd huddle together like sheep men would very soon die man breath be fatal to hi fellow this be literally as well a figuratively true men be devour by our town in a few generation the race die out or become degenerate it need renewal and it be always renew fromthe country send your child to renew themselves so to speak send them to regain in the open field the strength lose in the foul air of our crowded city woman hurry home that their child may be bear in the town they ought to do just the opposite especially those who mean to nurse their own child they would lose less than they think and in more natural surroundings the pleasure associate by nature with maternal duty would soon destroy the taste for other delight the newborn infant be first bath in warm water to which a little wine be usually add i think the wine might be dispense with a nature do not produce fermented liquor it be not likely that they be of much value to her creature in the same way it be unnecessary to take the precaution of heat the water in fact among many race the newborn infant be bath with no more ado in river or in the sea our child make tender before birth by the softness of their parent come into the world with a constitution already enfeeble which can not be at once expose to all the trial require to restore it to health little by little they must be restore to their natural vigour begin then by follow this custom and leave it off gradually wash your child often their dirty way show the need of this if they be only wipe their skin be injure but a they grow strong gradually reduce the heat of the water till at last you bathe them winter and summer in cold even in icecold water to avoid risk this change must be slow gradual and imperceptible so you may use the thermometer for exact measurement this habit of the bath once establish should never be break off it must be keep up all through life i value it not only on ground of cleanliness and present health but also a a wholesome mean of make the muscle supple and accustom them to bear without risk or effort extreme of heat and cold a he get old i would have the child train to bathe occasionally in hot water of every bearable degree and often in every degree of cold water now water be a denser fluid touch u at more point than air so that have learn to bear all the variation of temperature in water we shall scarcely feel this of the air footnote child in town be stifle by be keep indoors and too much wrap up those who control them have still to learn that fresh air far fromdo them harm will make them strong while hot air will make them weak will give rise to fever and will eventually kill them when the child draw it first breath do not confine it in tight wrapping no cap no bandage nor swaddle clothes loose and flow flannel wrapper which leave it limbs free and be not too heavy to check hi movement not too warm to prevent hi feel the air footnote i say cradle use the common word for want of a good though i be convince that it be never necessary and often harmful to rock child in the cradle put him in a big cradle well pad where he can move easily and safely a he begin to grow strong let him crawl about the room let him develop and stretch hi tiny limb you will see him gain strength fromday to day compare him with a well swaddle child of the same age and you will be surprise at their different rate of progress footnote the ancient peruvian wrap their child in loose swaddle band leave the arm quite free later they place them unswaddled in a hole in the ground line with cloth so that the low part of the body be in the hole and their arm be free and they could move the head and bend the body at will without fall or hurt themselves when they begin to walk they be entice to come to the breast the little negro be often in a position much more difficult for suck they cling to the mother hip and cling so tightly that the mother arm be often not need to support them they clasp the breast with their hand and continue suck while their mother go on with her ordinary work these child begin to walk at two month or rather to crawl later on they can run on all four almost as well a on their feetbuffon m buffon might also have quote the example of england where the senseless and barbarous swaddling clothes have become almost obsolete cf la longue voyage de siam le beau voyage de canada etc you must expect great opposition fromthe nurse who find a half strangled baby need much less watch besides hi dirty be more perceptible in an open garment he must be attend to more frequently indeed custom be an unanswerable argument in some land and among all class of people do not argue with the nurse give your order see them carry out and spare no pain to make the attention you prescribe easy in practice why not take your share in it with ordinary nursling where the body alone be think of nothing matter so long a the child life and do not actually die but with u when education begin with life the newborn child be already a disciple not of hi tutor but of nature the tutor merely study under this master and see that hi order be not evade he watch over the infant he observe it he look for the first feeble glimmering of intelligence a the moslem look for the moment of the moon rise in her first quarter we be bear capable of learn but know nothing perceive nothing the mind bind up within imperfect and half grown organ be not even aware of it own existence the movement and cry of the newborn child be purely reflex without knowledge or will suppose a child bear with the size and strength of manhood enter upon life full grown like pallas fromthe brain of jupiter such a childman would be a perfect idiot an automaton a statue without motion and almost without feeling he would see and hear nothing he would recognise no one he could not turn hi eye towards what he want to see not only would he perceive no external object he would not even be aware of sensation through the several senseorgans hi eye would not perceive colour hi ear sound hi body would be unaware of contact with neighbouring body he would not even know he have a body what hi hand handle would be in hi brain alone all hi sensation would be unite in one place they would exist only in the common sensorium he would have only one idea that of self to which he would refer all hi sensation and this idea or rather this feeling would be the only thing in which he excel an ordinary child this man full grown at birth would also be unable to stand on hi foot he would need a long time to learn how to keep hi balance perhaps he would not even be able to try to do it and you would see the big strong body leave in one place like a stone or creeping and crawl like a young puppy he would feel the discomfort of bodily need without know what be the matter and without know how to provide for these need there be no immediate connection between the muscle of the stomach and those of the arm and leg to make him take a step towards food or stretch a hand to seize it even be he surround with it and a hi body would be full grown and hi limb well develop he would be without the perpetual restlessness and movement of childhood so that he might die of hunger without stir to seek food however little you may have think about the order and development of our knowledge you can not deny that such a one would be in the state of almost primitive ignorance and stupidity natural to man before he have learn anything fromexperience or fromhi fellows we know then or we may know the point of departure fromwhich we each start towards the usual level of understand but who know the other extreme each progress more or less accord to hi genius hi taste hi need hi talent hi zeal and hi opportunity for use them no philosopher so far a i know have dare to say to man thus far shalt thou go and no further we know not what nature allow u to be none of u have measure the possible difference between man and man be there a mind so dead that this thought have never kindle it that have never say in hi pride how much have i already do how much more may i achieve why should i lag behind my fellow a i say before man education begin at birth before he can speak or understand he be learn experience precedes instruction when he recognise hi nurse he have learnt much the knowledge of the most ignorant man would surprise u if we have follow hi course frombirth to the present time if all human knowledge be divide into two part one common to all the other peculiar to the learn the latter would seem very small compare with the former but we scarcely heed this general experience because it be acquire before the age of reason moreover knowledge only attract attention by it rarity a in algebraic equation common factor count for nothing even animal learn much they have sens and must learn to use them they have need they must learn to satisfy them they must learn to eat walk or fly quadruped which can stand on their foot fromthe first can not walk for all that fromtheir first attempt it be clear that they lack confidence canary who escape fromtheir cage be unable to fly have never use their wing live and feeling creature be always learn if plant could walk they would need sens and knowledge els their specie would die out the child first mental experience be purely affective he be only aware of pleasure and pain it take him a long time to acquire the definite sensation which show him thing outside himself but before these thing present and withdraw themselves so to speak fromhi sight take size and shape for him the recurrence of emotional experience be begin to subject the child to the rule of habit you see hi eye constantly follow the light and if the light come fromthe side the eye turn towards it so that one must be careful to turn hi head towards the light lest he should squint he must also be accustom fromthe first to the dark or he will cry if he miss the light food and sleep too exactly measure become necessary at regular interval and soon desire be no longer the effect of need but of habit or rather habit add a fresh need to those of nature you must be on your guard against this the only habit the child should be allow to contract be that of have no habit let him be carry on either arm let him be accustom to offer either hand to use one or other indifferently let him not want to eat sleep or do anything at fixed hour nor be unable to be leave alone by day or night prepare the way for hi control of hi liberty and the use of hi strength by leave hi body it natural habit by make him capable of last selfcontrol of do all that he will when hi will be form as soon a the child begin to take notice what be show him must be carefully choose the natural man be interested in all new thing he feel so feeble that he fear the unknown the habit of see fresh thing without ill effect destroy this fear child bring up in clean house where there be no spider be afraid of spider and this fear often last through life i never saw peasant man woman or child afraid of spider since the mere choice of thing show him may make the child timid or brave why should not hi education begin before he can speak or understand i would have him accustom to see fresh thing ugly repulsive and strange beast but little by little and far off till he be use to them and till have see other handle them he handle them himself if in childhood he see toad snake and crayfish he will not be afraid of any animal when he be grow up those who be continually see terrible thing think nothing of them all child be afraid of mask i begin by show emile a mask with a pleasant face then some one put this mask before hi face i begin to laugh they all laugh too and the child with them by degree i accustom him to less pleasing mask and at last hideous one if i have arrange my stage skilfully far frombe afraid of the last mask he will laugh at it a he do at the first after that i be not afraid of people frighten him with mask when hector bid farewell to andromache the young astyanax startle by the nodding plume on the helmet do not know hi father he fling himself weep upon hi nurse bosom and win fromhi mother a smile mingle with tear what must be do to stay this terror just what hector do put the helmet on the ground and caress the child in a calm moment one would do more one would go up to the helmet play with the plume let the child feel them at last the nurse would take the helmet and place it laughingly on her own head if indeed a woman hand dare touch the armour of hector if emile must get use to the sound of a gun i first fire a pistol with a small charge he be delight with this sudden flash this sort of lightning i repeat the process with more powder gradually i add a small charge without a wad then a large in the end i accustom him to the sound of a gun to fireworks cannon and the most terrible explosion i have observe that child be rarely afraid of thunder unless the peal be really terrible and actually hurt the ear otherwise this fear only come to them when they know that thunder sometimes hurt or kill when reason begin to cause fear let use reassure them by slow and careful stage man and child learn to fear nothing in the dawn of life when memory and imagination have not begin to function the child only attend to what affect it sens hi sense experience be the raw material of thought they should therefore be present to him in fit order so that memory may at a future time present them in the same order to hi understand but a he only attend to hi sensation it be enough at first to show him clearly the connection between these sensation and the thing which cause them he want to touch and handle everything do not check these movement which teach him invaluable lesson thus he learn to perceive the heat cold hardness softness weight or lightness of body to judge their size and shape and all their physical property by look feel footnote of all the sens that of smell be the late to develop in child up to two or three year of age they appear to be insensible of pleasant or unpleasant odour in this respect they be a indifferent or rather as insensible a many animal listen and above all by compare sight and touch by judge with the eye what sensation they would cause to hi hand it be only by movement that we learn the difference between self and not self it be only by our own movement that we gain the idea of space the child have not this idea so he stretch out hi hand to seize the object within hi reach or that which be a hundred pace fromhim you take this a a sign of tyranny an attempt to bid the thing draw near or to bid you bring it nothing of the kind it be merely that the object first see in hi brain then before hi eye now seem close to hi arm and he have no idea of space beyond hi reach be careful therefore to take him about to move him fromplace to place and to let him perceive the change in hi surroundings so a to teach him to judge of distance when he begin to perceive distance then you must change your plan and only carry him when you please not when he please for as soon a he be no longer deceive by hi sens there be another motive for hi effort this change be remarkable and call for explanation the discomfort cause by real need be show by sign when the help of other be require hence the cry of child they often cry it must be so since they be only conscious of feeling when those feeling be pleasant they enjoy them in silence when they be painful they say so in their own way and demand relief now when they be awake they can scarcely be in a state of indifference either they be asleep or els they be feel something all our language be the result of art it have long be a subject of inquiry whether there ever be a natural language common to all no doubt there be and it be the language of child before they begin to speak this language be inarticulate but it have tone stress and mean the use of our own language have lead u to neglect it so far a to forget it altogether let u study child and we shall soon learn it afresh fromthem nurse can teach u this language they understand all their nursling say to them they answer them and keep up long conversation with them and though they use word these word be quite useless it be not the hearing of the word but it accompanying intonation that be understood to the language of intonation be add the no less forcible language of gesture the child use not it weak hand but it face the amount of expression in these undeveloped face be extraordinary their feature change fromone moment to another with incredible speed you see smiles desire terror come and go like lightning every time the face seem different the muscle of the face be undoubtedly more mobile than our own on the other hand the eye be almost expressionless such must be the sort of sign they use at an age when their only need be those of the body grimace be the sign of sensation the glance express sentiment a man first state be one of want and weakness hi first sound be cry and tear the child feel hi need and can not satisfy them he beg for help by hi cry be he hungry or thirsty there be tear be he too cold or too hot more tear he need movement and be keep quiet more tear he want to sleep and be disturb he weep the less comfortable he be the more he demand change he have only one language because he have so to say only one kind of discomfort in the imperfect state of hi sense organs he do not distinguish their several impression all ill produce one feeling of sorrow these tear which you think so little worthy of your attention give rise to the first relation between man and hi environment here be forge the first link in the long chain of social order when the child cry he be uneasy he feel some need which he can not satisfy you watch him seek this need find it and satisfy it if you can neither find it nor satisfy it the tear continue and become tiresome the child be pet to quiet him he be rock or sing to sleep if he be obstinate the nurse becomes impatient and threaten him cruel nurse sometimes strike him what strange lesson for him at hi first entrance into life i shall never forget see one of these troublesome cry child thus beat by hi nurse he be silent at once i think he be frighten and say to myself this will be a servile be fromwhom nothing can be get but by harshness i be wrong the poor wretch be choke with rage he could not breathe he be black in the face a moment later there be bitter cry every sign of the anger rage and despair of this age be in hi tone i think he would die had i doubt the innate sense of justice and injustice in man heart this one instance would have convince me i be sure that a drop of boil liquid fall by chance on that child hand would have hurt him less than that blow slight in itself but clearly give with the intention of hurt him this tendency to anger vexation and rage need great care boerhaave think that most of the disease of child be of the nature of convulsion because the head be large in proportion and the nervous system more extensive than in adult they be more liable to nervous irritation take the great care to remove fromthem any servant who tease annoy or vex them they be a hundredfold more dangerous and more fatal than fresh air and change season when child only experience resistance in thing and never in the will of man they do not become rebellious or passionate and their health be well this be one reason why the child of the poor who be free and more independent be generally less frail and weakly more vigorous than those who be suppose to be good bring up by be constantly thwart but you must always remember that it be one thing to refrain fromthwart them but quite another to obey them the child first tear be prayer beware l they become command he begin by ask for aid he end by demand service thus fromhi own weakness the source of hi first consciousness of dependence spring the late idea of rule and tyranny but a this idea be arouse rather by hi need than by our service we begin to see moral result whose cause be not in nature thus we see how important it be even at the early age to discern the secret meaning of the gesture or cry when the child try to seize something without speak he think he can reach the object for he do not rightly judge it distance when he cry and stretch out hi hand he no longer misjudge the distance he bid the object approach or order you to bring it to him in the first case bring it to him slowly in the second do not even seem to hear hi cry the more he cry the less you should heed him he must learn in good time not to give command to men for he be not their master nor to thing for they can not hear him thus when the child want something you mean to give him it be well to carry him to it rather than to bring the thing to him fromthis he will draw a conclusion suit to hi age and there be no other way of suggest it to him the abbe saintpierre call men big child one might also call child little men these statement be true but they require explanation but when hobbes call the wicked a strong child hi statement be contradict by fact all wickedness come fromweakness the child be only naughty because he be weak make him strong and he will be good if we could do everything we should never do wrong of all the attribute of the almighty goodness be that which it would be hard to dissociate fromour conception of him all nation who have acknowledge a good and an evil power have always regard the evil a inferior to the good otherwise their opinion would have be absurd compare this with the creed of the savoyard clergyman later on in this book reason alone teach u to know good and evil therefore conscience which make u love the one and hate the other though it be independent of reason can not develop without it before the age of reason we do good or ill without know it and there be no morality in our action although there be sometimes in our feeling with regard to other people action in relation to ourselves a child want to overturn everything he see he break and smash everything he can reach he seize a bird a he seize a stone and strangle it without know what he be about why so in the first place philosophy will account for this by inbred sin man pride love of power selfishness spite perhaps it will say in addition to this that the child consciousness of hi own weakness make him eager to use hi strength to convince himself of it but watch that break down old man reduce in the downward course of life to the weakness of a child not only be he quiet and peaceful he would have all about him quiet and peaceful too the least change disturbs and trouble him he would like to see universal calm how be it possible that similar feebleness and similar passion should produce such different effect in age and in infancy if the original cause be not different and where can we find this difference in cause except in the bodily condition of the two the active principle common to both be grow in one case and decline in the other it be be form in the one and destroy in the other one be move towards life the other towards death the fail activity of the old man be centre in hi heart the child overflow activity spread abroad he feel if we may say so strong enough to give life to all about him to make or to destroy it be all one to him change be what he seek and all change involve action if he seem to enjoy destructive activity it be only that it take time to make thing and very little time to break them so that the work of destruction accord well with hi eagerness while the author of nature have give child this activity he take care that it shall do little harm by give them small power to use it but as soon a they can think of people a tool to be use they use them to carry out their wish and to supplement their own weakness this be how they become tiresome masterful imperious naughty and unmanageable a development which do not spring froma natural love of power but one which have be teach them for it do not need much experience to realise how pleasant it be to set other to work and to move the world by a word a the child grow it gain strength and become less restless and unquiet and more independent soul and body become well balanced and nature no longer ask for more movement than be require for selfpreservation but the love of power do not die with the need that arouse it power arouses and flatters selflove and habit strengthens it thus caprice follow upon need and the first seed of prejudice and obstinacy be sow first maximfar frombe too strong child be not strong enough for all the claim of nature give them full use of such strength a they have they will not abuse it second maximhelp them and supply the experience and strength they lack whenever the need be of the body third maximin the help you give them confine yourself to what be really needful without grant anything to caprice or unreason for they will not be torment by caprice if you do not call it into existence see it be no part of nature fourth maximstudy carefully their speech and gesture so that at an age when they be incapable of deceit you may discriminate between those desire which come fromnature and those which spring fromperversity the spirit of these rule be to give child more real liberty and less power to let them do more for themselves and demand less of other so that by teach them fromthe first to confine their wish within the limit of their power they will scarcely feel the want of whatever be not in their power this be another very important reason for leave children limb and body perfectly free only take care that they do not fall and keep anything that might hurt them out of their way the child whose body and arm be free will certainly cry much less than a child tie up in swaddle clothes he who know only bodily need only cry when in pain and this be a great advantage for then we know exactly when he need help and if possible we should not delay our help for an instant but if you can not relieve hi pain stay where you be and do not flatter him by way of soothe him your caress will not cure hi colic but he will remember what he must do to win them and if he once find out how to gain your attention at will he be your master the whole education be spoil their movement be less constrained child will cry less less wearied with their tear people will not take so much trouble to check them with few threat and promise they will be less timid and less obstinate and will remain more nearly in their natural state rupture be produce less by let child cry than by the mean take to stop them and my evidence for this be the fact that the most neglected child be less liable to them than other i be very far fromwish that they should be neglect on the contrary it be of the utmost importance that their want should be anticipate so that they need not proclaim their want by cry but neither would i have unwise care bestow on them why should they think it wrong to cry when they find they can get so much by it when they have learn the value of their silence they take good care not to waste it in the end they will so exaggerate it importance that no one will be able to pay it price then wear out with cry they become exhausted and be at length silent prolong cry on the part of a child neither swaddle nor out of health a child who lack nothing be merely the result of habit or obstinacy such tear be no longer the work of nature but the work of the child nurse who could not resist it importunity and so have increase it without consider that while she quiet the child today she be teach him to cry louder tomorrow moreover when caprice or obstinacy be the cause of their tear there be a sure way of stop them by distract their attention by some pleasant or conspicuous object which make them forget that they want to cry most nurse excel in this art and rightly use it be very useful but it be of the utmost importance that the child should not perceive that you mean to distract hi attention and that he should be amuse without suspect you be think about him now this be what most nurse can not do most child be wean too soon the time to wean them be when they cut their teeth this generally cause pain and suffering at this time the child instinctively carry everything he get hold of to hi mouth to chew it to help forward this process he be give a a plaything some hard object such a ivory or a wolfs tooth i think this be a mistake hard body apply to the gum do not soften them far fromit they make the process of cut the teeth more difficult and painful let u always take instinct a our guide we never see puppy practise their budding teeth on pebble iron or bone but on wood leather rag soft material which yield to their jaw and on which the tooth leave it mark we can do nothing simply not even for our child toy of silver gold coral cut crystal rattle of every price and kind what vain and useless appliance away with them all let u have no coral or rattle a small branch of a tree with it leaf and fruit a stick of liquorice which he may suck and chew will amuse him as well a these splendid trifle and they will have this advantage at least he will not be bring up to luxury fromhi birth it be admit that pap be not a very wholesome food boiled milk and uncooked flour cause gravel and do not suit the stomach in pap the flour be less thoroughly cook than in bread and it have not ferment i think bread and milk or ricecream be well if you will have pap the flour should be lightly cook beforehand in my own country they make a very pleasant and wholesome soup fromflour thus heat meatbroth or soup be not a very suitable food and should be use as little a possible the child must first get use to chew hi food this be the right way to bring the teeth through and when the child begin to swallow the saliva mixed with the food help digestion i would have them first chew dried fruit or crust i should give them a plaything little bit of dry bread or biscuit like the piedmont bread know in the country a gris by dint of soften this bread in the mouth some of it be eventually swallow the teeth come through of themselves and the child be wean almost imperceptibly peasant have usually very good digestion and they be wean with no more ado fromthe very first child hear spoken language we speak to them before they can understand or even imitate spoken sound the vocal organ be still stiff and only gradually lend themselves to the reproduction of the sound hear it be even doubtful whether these sound be heard distinctly a we hear them the nurse may amuse the child with song and with very merry and varied intonation but i object to her bewilder the child with a multitude of vain word of which it understand nothing but her tone of voice i would have the first word he hear few in number distinctly and often repeat while the word themselves should be relate to thing which can first be show to the child that fatal facility in the use of word we do not understand begin early than we think in the schoolroom the scholar listen to the verbiage of hi master a he listen in the cradle to the babble of hi nurse i think it would be a very useful education to leave him in ignorance of both all sort of idea crowd in upon u when we try to consider the development of speech and the child first word whatever we do they all learn to talk in the same way and all philosophical speculation be utterly useless to begin with they have so to say a grammar of their own whose rule and syntax be more general than our own if you attend carefully you will be surprise to find how exactly they follow certain analogy very much mistake if you like but very regular these form be only objectionable because of their harshness or because they be not recognise by custom i have just hear a child severely scold by hi father for say mon pere iraijety now we see that this child be follow the analogy more closely than our grammarian for a they say to him vasy why should he not say iraijety notice too the skilful way in which he avoid the hiatus in iraijey or yiraije be it the poor child fault that we have so unskilfully deprive the phrase of this determinative adverb y because we do not know what to do with it it be an intolerable piece of pedantry and most superfluous attention to detail to make a point of correct all children little sin against the customary expression for they always cure themselves with time always speak correctly before them let them never be so happy with any one a with you and be sure that their speech will be imperceptibly model upon yours without any correction on your part but a much great evil and one far less easy to guard against be that they be urge to speak too much a if people be afraid they would not learn to talk of themselves this indiscreet zeal produce an effect directly opposite to what be mean they speak later and more confusedly the extreme attention pay to everything they say make it unnecessary for them to speak distinctly and a they will scarcely open their mouth many of them contract a vicious pronunciation and a confused speech which last all their life and make them almost unintelligible i have live much among peasant and i never know one of them lisp man or woman boy or girl why be this are their speech organ differently make fromour own no but they be differently use there be a hillock face my window on which the child of the place assemble for their game although they be far enough away i can distinguish perfectly what they say and often get good note for this book every day my ear deceives me a to their age i hear the voice of child of ten i look and see the height and feature of child of three or four this experience be not confine to me the townspeople who come to see me and whom i consult on this point all fall into the same mistake this result fromthe fact that up to five or six child in town bring up in a room and under the care of a nursery governess do not need to speak above a whisper to make themselves heard as soon a their lip move people take pain to make out what they mean they be taught word which they repeat inaccurately and by pay great attention to them the people who be always with them rather guess what they mean to say than what they say it be quite a different matter in the country a peasant woman be not always with her child he be oblige to learn to say very clearly and loudly what he want if he be to make himself understood child scatter about the field at a distance fromtheir father mother and other child gain practice in make themselves hear at a distance and in adapt the loudness of the voice to the distance which separate them fromthose to whom they want to speak this be the real way to learn pronunciation not by stammer out a few vowel into the ear of an attentive governess so when you question a peasant child he may be too shy to answer but what he say he say distinctly while the nurse must serve a interpreter for the town child without her one can understand nothing of what he be mutter between hi teeth footnote there be exception to this and often those child who at first be most difficult to hear become the noisy when they begin to raise their voice but if i be to enter into all these detail i should never make an end every sensible reader ought to see that defect and excess cause by the same abuse be both correct by my method i regard the two maxim a inseparablealways enoughnever too much when the first be well establish the latter necessarily follow on it a they grow old the boy be suppose to be cure of this fault at college the girl in the convent school and indeed both usually speak more clearly than child bring up entirely at home but they be prevent fromacquire a clear a pronunciation a the peasant in this waythey be require to learn all sort of thing by heart and to repeat aloud what they have learn for when they be study they get into the way of gabbling and pronounce carelessly and ill it be still bad when they repeat their lesson they can not find the right word they drag out their syllable this be only possible when the memory hesitate the tongue do not stammer of itself thus they acquire or continue habit of bad pronunciation later on you will see that emile do not acquire such habit or at least not fromthis cause i grant you uneducated people and villager often fall into the opposite extreme they almost always speak too loud their pronunciation be too exact and lead to rough and coarse articulation their accent be too pronounced they choose their expression badly etc but to begin with this extreme strike me a much less dangerous than the other for the first law of speech be to make oneself understood and the chief fault be to fail to be understood to pride ourselves on have no accent be to pride ourselves on rid our phrase of strength and elegance emphasis be the soul of speech it give it it feeling and truth emphasis deceive less than word perhaps that be why welleducated people be so afraid of it fromthe custom of say everything in the same tone have arise that of poke fun at people without their knowing it when emphasis be proscribe it place be take by all sort of ridiculous affected and ephemeral pronunciation such a one observe especially among the young people about court it be this affectation of speech and manner which make frenchman disagreeable and repulsive to other nation on first acquaintance emphasis be find not in their speech but in their bearing that be not the way to make themselves attractive all these little fault of speech which you be so afraid the child will acquire be mere trifle they may be prevent or correct with the great ease but the fault which be teach them when you make them speak in a low indistinct and timid voice when you be always criticise their tone and find fault with their word be never cure a man who have only learn to speak in society of fine lady could not make himself hear at the head of hi troop and would make little impression on the rabble in a riot first teach the child to speak to men he will be able to speak to the woman when require brought up in all the rustic simplicity of the country your child will gain a more sonorous voice they will not acquire the hesitate stammer of town child neither will they acquire the expression nor the tone of the villager or if they do they will easily lose them their master be with them fromtheir early year and more and more in their society the old they grow will be able to prevent or efface by speak correctly himself the impression of the peasant talk emile will speak the pure french i know but he will speak it more distinctly and with a good articulation than myself the child who be try to speak should hear nothing but word he can understand nor should he say word he can not articulate hi effort lead him to repeat the same syllable a if he be practise it clear pronunciation when he begin to stammer do not try to understand him to expect to be always listen to be a form of tyranny which be not good for the child see carefully to hi real need and let him try to make you understand the rest still less should you hurry him into speech he will learn to talk when he feel the want of it it have indeed be remark that those who begin to speak very late never speak so distinctly a other but it be not because they talk late that they be hesitate on the contrary they begin to talk late because they hesitate if not why do they begin to talk so late have they less need of speech have they be less urged to it on the contrary the anxiety arouse with the first suspicion of this backwardness lead people to tease them much more to begin to talk than those who articulate early and this mistaken zeal may do much to make their speech confuse when with less haste they might have have time to bring it to great perfection child who be force to speak too soon have no time to learn either to pronounce correctly or to understand what they be make to say while leave to themselves they first practise the easy syllable and then add to them little by little some meaning which their gesture explain they teach you their own word before they learn yours by this mean they do not acquire your word till they have understand them be in no hurry to use them they begin by carefully observe the sense in which you use them and when they be sure of them they adopt them the bad evil result fromthe precocious use of speech by young child be that we not only fail to understand the first word they use we misunderstand them without know it so that while they seem to answer u correctly they fail to understand u and we them this be the most frequent cause of our surprise at children saying we attribute to them idea which they do not attach to their word this lack of attention on our part to the real meaning which word have for child seem to me the cause of their early misconception and these misconception even when correct colour their whole course of thought for the rest of their life i shall have several opportunity of illustrate these by example later on let the child vocabulary therefore be limit it be very undesirable that he should have more word than idea that he should be able to say more than he think one of the reason why peasant be generally shrewd than townsfolk be i think that their vocabulary be small they have few idea but those few be thoroughly grasp the infant be progress in several way at once he be learn to talk eat and walk about the same time this be really the first phase of hi life up till now he be little more than he be before birth he have neither feel nor think he be barely capable of sensation he be unconscious of hi own existence vivit et est vitae nescius ips suaeovid we have now reach the second phase of life infancy strictly socalled be over for the word infans and puer be not synonymous the latter include the former which mean literally one who can not speak thus valerius speaks of puerum infantem but i shall continue to use the word child french enfant accord to the custom of our language till an age for which there be another term when child begin to talk they cry less this progress be quite natural one language supplant another as soon a they can say it hurt me why should they cry unless the pain be too sharp for word if they still cry those about them be to blame when once emile have say it hurt me it will take a very sharp pain to make him cry if the child be delicate and sensitive if by nature he begin to cry for nothing i let him cry in vain and soon check hi tear at their source so long a he cry i will not go near him i come at once when he leave off cry he will soon be quiet when he want to call me or rather he will utter a single cry child learn the meaning of sign by their effect they have no other meaning for them however much a child hurt himself when he be alone he rarely cry unless he expect to be heard should he fall or bump hi head or make hi nose bleed or cut hi finger i shall show no alarm nor shall i make any fuss over him i shall take no notice at any rate at first the harm be do he must bear it all my zeal could only frighten him more and make him more nervous indeed it be not the blow but the fear of it which distress u when we be hurt i shall spare him this suffering at least for he will certainly regard the injury a he see me regard it if he find that i hasten anxiously to him if i pity him or comfort him he will think he be badly hurt if he find i take no notice he will soon recover himself and will think the wound be heal when it cease to hurt this be the time for hi first lesson in courage and by bear slight ill without fear we gradually learn to bear great i shall not take pain to prevent emile hurt himself far fromit i should be vexed if he never hurt himself if he grow up unacquainted with pain to bear pain be hi first and most useful lesson it seem a if child be small and weak on purpose to teach them these valuable lesson without danger the child have such a little way to fall he will not break hi leg if he knock himself with a stick he will not break hi arm if he seize a sharp knife he will not grasp it tight enough to make a deep wound so far a i know no child leave to himself have ever be know to kill or maim itself or even to do itself any serious harm unless it have be foolishly leave on a high place or alone near the fire or within reach of dangerous weapon what be there to be say for all the paraphernalia with which the child be surround to shield him on every side so that he grow up at the mercy of pain with neither courage nor experience so that he think he be kill by a pinprick and faint at the sight of blood with our foolish and pedantic method we be always prevent child fromlearn what they could learn much good by themselves while we neglect what we alone can teach them can anything be silly than the pain take to teach them to walk a if there be any one who be unable to walk when he grow up through hi nurse neglect how many we see walk badly all their life because they be ill teach emile shall have no headpads no gocarts no leadingstrings or at least as soon a he can put one foot before another he shall only be support along pavement and he shall be take quickly across them footnote there be nothing so absurd and hesitate a the gait of those who have be keep too long in leadingstrings when they be little this be one of the observation which be consider trivial because they be true instead of keep him mew up in a stuffy room take him out into a meadow every day let him run about let him struggle and fall again and again the oftener the good he will learn all the sooner to pick himself up the delight of liberty will make up for many bruise my pupil will hurt himself oftener than yours but he will always be merry your pupil may receive few injury but they be always thwart constrain and sad i doubt whether they be any good off a their strength increase child have also less need for tear they can do more for themselves they need the help of other less frequently with strength come the sense to use it it be with this second phase that the real personal life have it begin it be then that the child become conscious of himself during every moment of hi life memory call up the feeling of self he become really one person always the same and therefore capable of joy or sorrow hence we must begin to consider him a a moral be although we know approximately the limit of human life and our chance of attain those limit nothing be more uncertain than the length of the life of any one of u very few reach old age the chief risk occur at the beginning of life the short our past life the less we must hope to live of all the child who be bear scarcely one half reach adolescence and it be very likely your pupil will not live to be a man what be to be think therefore of that cruel education which sacrifice the present to an uncertain future that burden a child with all sort of restriction and begin by make him miserable in order to prepare him for some faroff happiness which he may never enjoy even if i consider that education wise in it aim how could i view without indignation those poor wretch subject to an intolerable slavery and condemn like galleyslaves to endless toil with no certainty that they will gain anything by it the age of harmless mirth be spend in tear punishment threat and slavery you torment the poor thing for hi good you fail to see that you be call death to snatch him fromthese gloomy surroundings who can say how many child fall victim to the excessive care of their father and mother they be happy to escape fromthis cruelty this be all that they gain fromthe ill they be force to endure they die without regret have know nothing of life but it sorrow men be kind to your fellowmen this be your first duty kind to every age and station kind to all that be not foreign to humanity what wisdom can you find that be great than kindness love childhood indulge it sport it pleasure it delightful instinct who have not sometimes regret that age when laughter be ever on the lip and when the heart be ever at peace why rob these innocent of the joy which pass so quickly of that precious gift which they can not abuse why fill with bitterness the fleeting day of early childhood day which will no more return for them than for you father can you tell when death will call your child to him do not lay up sorrow for yourselves by rob them of the short span which nature have allot to them as soon a they be aware of the joy of life let them rejoice in it go that whenever god call them they may not die without have taste the joy of life how people will cry out against me i hear fromafar the shout of that false wisdom which be ever drag u onwards count the present a nothing and pursue without a pause a future which fly a we pursue that false wisdom which remove u fromour place and never bring u to any other now be the time you say to correct hi evil tendency we must increase suffering in childhood when it be less keenly felt to lessen it in manhood but how do you know that you can carry out all these fine scheme how do you know that all this fine teaching with which you overwhelm the feeble mind of the child will not do him more harm than good in the future how do you know that you can spare him anything by the vexation you heap upon him now why inflict on him more ill than befit hi present condition unless you be quite sure that these present ill will save him future ill and what proof can you give me that those evil tendency you profess to cure be not the result of your foolish precaution rather than of nature what a poor sort of foresight to make a child wretched in the present with the more or less doubtful hope of make him happy at some future day if such blundering thinker fail to distinguish between liberty and licence between a merry child and a spoilt darling let them learn to discriminate let u not forget what befit our present state in the pursuit of vain fancy mankind have it place in the sequence of thing childhood have it place in the sequence of human life the man must be treat a a man and the child a a child give each hi place and keep him there control human passion accord to man nature that be all we can do for hi welfare the rest depend on external force which be beyond our control absolute good and evil be unknown to u in this life they be blend together we never enjoy any perfectly pure feel nor do we remain for more than a moment in the same state the feeling of our mind like the change in our body be in a continual flux good and ill be common to all but in vary proportion the happiest be he who suffer least the most miserable be he who enjoy least ever more sorrow than joythis be the lot of all of u man happiness in this world be but a negative state it must be reckon by the fewness of hi ill every feeling of hardship be inseparable fromthe desire to escape fromit every idea of pleasure fromthe desire to enjoy it all desire implies a want and all want be painful hence our wretchedness consist in the disproportion between our desire and our power a conscious be whose power be equal to hi desire would be perfectly happy what then be human wisdom where be the path of true happiness the mere limitation of our desire be not enough for if they be less than our power part of our faculty would be idle and we should not enjoy our whole be neither be the mere extension of our power enough for if our desire be also increase we should only be the more miserable true happiness consist in decrease the difference between our desire and our power in establish a perfect equilibrium between the power and the will then only when all it force be employ will the soul be at rest and man will find himself in hi true position in this condition nature who do everything for the best have place him fromthe first to begin with she give him only such desire a be necessary for selfpreservation and such power a be sufficient for their satisfaction all the rest she have store in hi mind a a sort of reserve to be draw upon at need it be only in this primitive condition that we find the equilibrium between desire and power and then alone man be not unhappy as soon a hi potential power of mind begin to function imagination more powerful than all the rest awakes and precedes all the rest it be imagination which enlarge the bound of possibility for u whether for good or ill and therefore stimulates and feed desire by the hope of satisfy them but the object which seem within our grasp fly quick than we can follow when we think we have grasp it it transform itself and be again far ahead of u we no longer perceive the country we have traverse and we think nothing of it that which lie before u become vaster and stretch still before u thus we exhaust our strength yet never reach our goal and the nearer we be to pleasure the further we be fromhappiness on the other hand the more nearly a mans condition approximate to this state of nature the less difference be there between hi desire and hi power and happiness be therefore less remote lack everything he be never less miserable for misery consist not in the lack of thing but in the need which they inspire the world of reality have it bound the world of imagination be boundless a we can not enlarge the one let u restrict the other for all the suffering which really make u miserable arise fromthe difference between the real and the imaginary health strength and a good conscience except all the good thing of life be a matter of opinion except bodily suffer and remorse all our woe be imaginary you will tell me this be a commonplace i admit it but it practical application be no commonplace and it be with practice only that we be now concern what do you mean when you say man be weak the term weak imply a relation a relation of the creature to whom it be apply an insect or a worm whose strength exceed it need be strong an elephant a lion a conqueror a hero a god himself whose need exceed hi strength be weak the rebellious angel who fight against hi own nature be weak than the happy mortal who be live at peace accord to nature when man be content to be himself he be strong indeed when he strive to be more than man he be weak indeed but do not imagine that you can increase your strength by increase your power not so if your pride increase more rapidly your strength be diminish let u measure the extent of our sphere and remain in it centre like the spider in it web we shall have strength sufficient for our need we shall have no cause to lament our weakness for we shall never be aware of it the other animal posse only such power a be require for selfpreservation man alone have more be it not very strange that this superfluity should make him miserable in every land a man labour yield more than a bare living if he be wise enough to disregard this surplus he would always have enough for he would never have too much great need say favorin spring fromgreat wealth and often the best way of get what we want be to get rid of what we have by strive to increase our happiness we change it into wretchedness if a man be content to live he would live happy and he would therefore be good for what would he have to gain by vice if we be immortal we should all be miserable no doubt it be hard to die but it be sweet to think that we shall not live for ever and that a good life will put an end to the sorrow of this world if we have the offer of immortality here below who would accept the sorrowful gift footnote you understand i be speak of those who think and not of the crowd what resource what hop what consolation would be leave against the cruelty of fate and man injustice the ignorant man never look before he know little of the value of life and do not fear to lose it the wise man see thing of great worth and prefers them to it half knowledge and sham wisdom set u think about death and what lie beyond it and they thus create the bad of our ill the wise man bear lifes ill all the good because he know he must die life would be too dearly buy do we not know that sooner or later death will end it our moral ill be the result of prejudice crime alone except and that depend on ourselves our bodily ills either put an end to themselves or to u time or death will cure them but the less we know how to bear it the great be our pain and we suffer more in our effort to cure our disease than if we endure them live accord to nature be patient get rid of the doctor you will not escape death but you will only die once while the doctor make you die daily through your diseased imagination their lying art instead of prolong your day rob you of all delight in them i be always ask what real good this art have do to mankind true the doctor cure some who would have die but they kill million who would have live if you be wise you will decline to take part in this lottery when the odds be so great against you suffer die or get good but whatever you do live while you be alive human institution be one mass of folly and contradiction a our life lose it value we set a high price upon it the old regret life more than the young they do not want to lose all they have spend in prepare for it enjoyment at sixty it be cruel to die when one have not begin to live man be credit with a strong desire for selfpreservation and this desire exist but we fail to perceive that this desire a felt by u be largely the work of man in a natural state man be only eager to preserve hi life while he have the mean for it preservation when selfpreservation be no longer possible he resign himself to hi fate and dy without vain torment nature teach u the first law of resignation savage like wild beast make very little struggle against death and meet it almost without a murmur when this natural law be overthrown reason establish another but few discern it and man resignation be never so complete a nature prudence prudence which be ever bid u look forward into the future a future which in many case we shall never reach here be the real source of all our trouble how mad it be for so shortlived a creature a man to look forward into a future to which he rarely attain while he neglect the present which be hi this madness be all the more fatal since it increase with year and the old always timid prudent and miserly prefer to do without necessary today that they may have luxury at a hundred thus we grasp everything we cling to everything we be anxious about time place people thing all that be and will be we ourselves be but the least part of ourselves we spread ourselves so to speak over the whole world and all this vast expanse become sensitive no wonder our woe increase when we may be wound on every side how many prince make themselves miserable for the loss of land they never saw and how many merchant lament in paris over some misfortune in the indie be it nature that carry men so far fromtheir real self be it her will that each should learn hi fate fromother and even be the last to learn it so that a man die happy or miserable before he know what he be about there be a healthy cheerful strong and vigorous man it do me good to see him hi eye tell of content and wellbeing he be the picture of happiness a letter come by post the happy man glance at it it be address to him he open it and read it in a moment he be change he turn pale and fall into a swoon when he come to himself he weep lament and groan he tear hi hair and hi shriek reecho through the air you would say he be in convulsion fool what harm have this bit of paper do you what limb have it torn away what crime have it make you commit what change have it wrought in you to reduce you to this state of misery have the letter miscarry have some kindly hand throw it into the fire it strike me that the fate of this mortal at once happy and unhappy would have offer u a strange problem hi misfortune you say be real enough grant but he do not feel them what of that hi happiness be imaginary i admit it health wealth a contented spirit be mere dream we no longer live in our own place we live outside it what do it profit u to live in such fear of death when all that make life worth living be our own oh man live your own life and you will no longer be wretched keep to your appoint place in the order of nature and nothing can tear you fromit do not kick against the stern law of necessity nor waste in vain resistance the strength bestow on you by heaven not to prolong or extend your existence but to preserve it so far and so long a heaven plea your freedom and your power extend a far and no further than your natural strength anything more be but slavery deceit and trickery power itself be servile when it depend upon public opinion for you be dependent on the prejudice of other when you rule them by mean of those prejudice to lead them a you will they must be lead a they will they have only to change their way of thinking and you be force to change your course of action those who approach you need only contrive to sway the opinion of those you rule or of the favourite by whom you be rule or those of your own family or theirs have you the genius of themistocles footnote you see that little boy say themistocles to hi friend the fate of greece be in hi hand for he rule hi mother and hi mother rule me i rule the athenian and the athenian rule the greek what petty creatures we should often find control great empire if we trace the course of power fromthe prince to those who secretly put that power in motion vizier courtier priest soldier servant babbler the very child themselves would lead you like a child in the midst of your legion whatever you do your actual authority can never extend beyond your own power as soon a you be oblige to see with anothers eye you must will what he will you say with pride my people be my subject grant but what be you the subject of your minister and your minister what be they the subject of their clerk their mistress the servant of their servant grasp all usurp all and then pour out your silver with both hand set up your battery raise the gallows and the wheel make law issue proclamation multiply your spy your soldier your hangman your prison and your chain poor little men what good do it do you you will be no well serve you will be none the less robbed and deceive you will be no near absolute power you will say continually it be our will and you will continually do the will of other there be only one man who get hi own wayhe who can get it singlehanded therefore freedom not power be the great good that man be truly free who desire what he be able to perform and do what he desire this be my fundamental maxim apply it to childhood and all the rule of education spring fromit society have enfeeble man not merely by rob him of the right to hi own strength but still more by make hi strength insufficient for hi need this be why hi desire increase in proportion to hi weakness and this be why the child be weak than the man if a man be strong and a child be weak it be not because the strength of the one be absolutely great than the strength of the other but because the one can naturally provide for himself and the other can not thus the man will have more desire and the child more caprice a word which mean i take it desire which be not true need desire which can only be satisfy with the help of other i have already give the reason for this state of weakness parental affection be natures provision against it but parental affection may be carry to excess it may be want or it may be ill apply parent who live under our ordinary social condition bring their child into these condition too soon by increase hi need they do not relieve hi weakness they rather increase it they far increase it by demand of him what nature do not demand by subject to their will what little strength he have to further hi own wish by make slave of themselves or of him instead of recognise that mutual dependence which should result fromhi weakness or their affection the wise man can keep hi own place but the child who do not know what hi place be be unable to keep it there be a thousand way out of it and it be the business of those who have charge of the child to keep him in hi place and this be no easy task he should be neither beast nor man but a child he must feel hi weakness but not suffer through it he must be dependent but he must not obey he must ask not command he be only subject to other because of hi need and because they see good than he what he really need what may help or hinder hi existence no one not even hi father have the right to bid the child do what be of no use to him when our natural tendency have not be interfere with by human prejudice and human institution the happiness alike of child and of men consists in the enjoyment of their liberty but the child liberty be restrict by hi lack of strength he who do a he like be happy provide he be selfsufficing it be so with the man who be live in a state of nature he who do what he like be not happy if hi desire exceed hi strength it be so with a child in like condition even in a state of nature child only enjoy an imperfect liberty like that enjoy by men in social life each of u unable to dispense with the help of other becomes so far weak and wretched we be mean to be men law and custom thrust u back into infancy the rich and great the very king themselves be but child they see that we be ready to relieve their misery this make them childishly vain and they be quite proud of the care bestow on them a care which they would never get if they be grow men these be weighty consideration and they provide a solution for all the conflict problem of our social system there be two kind of dependence dependence on thing which be the work of nature and dependence on men which be the work of society dependence on thing be nonmoral do no injury to liberty and beget no vice dependence on men be out of order footnote in my principle of political law it be prove that no private will can be order in the social system give rise to every kind of vice and through this master and slave become mutually depraved if there be any cure for this social evil it be to be find in the substitution of law for the individual in arm the general will with a real strength beyond the power of any individual will if the law of nation like the law of nature could never be break by any human power dependence on men would become dependence on thing all the advantage of a state of nature would be combine with all the advantage of social life in the commonwealth the liberty which preserve a man fromvice would be unite with the morality which raise him to virtue keep the child dependent on thing only by this course of education you will have follow the order of nature let hi unreasonable wish meet with physical obstacle only or the punishment which result fromhi own action lesson which will be recall when the same circumstance occur again it be enough to prevent him fromwrong do without forbid him to do wrong experience or lack of power should take the place of law give him not what he want but what he need let there be no question of obedience for him or tyranny for you supply the strength he lack just so far a be require for freedom not for power so that he may receive your service with a sort of shame and look forward to the time when he may dispense with them and may achieve the honour of selfhelp nature provide for the child growth in her own fashion and this should never be thwart do not make him sit still when he want to run about nor run when he want to be quiet if we do not spoil our children will by our blunder their desire would be free fromcaprice let them run jump and shout to their heart content all their own activity be instinct of the body for it growth in strength but you should regard with suspicion those wish which they can not carry out for themselves those which other must carry out for them then you must distinguish carefully between natural and artificial need between the need of budding caprice and the need which spring fromthe overflow life just describe i have already tell you what you ought to do when a child cry for this thing or that i will only add that as soon a he have word to ask for what he want and accompany hi demand with tear either to get hi own way quicker or to override a refusal he should never have hi way if hi word be prompt by a real need you should recognise it and satisfy it at once but to yield to hi tear be to encourage him to cry to teach him to doubt your kindness and to think that you be influence more by hi importunity than your own goodwill if he do not think you kind he will soon think you unkind if he think you weak he will soon become obstinate what you mean to give must be give at once be chary of refuse but have refuse do not change your mind above all beware of teach the child empty phrase of politeness which serve a spell to subdue those around him to hi will and to get him what he want at once the artificial education of the rich never fail to make them politely imperious by teach them the word to use so that no one will dare to resist them their child have neither the tone nor the manner of suppliant they be a haughty or even more haughty in their entreaty than in their command a though they be more certain to be obey you see at once that if you please mean it please me and i beg mean i command what a fine sort of politeness which only succeed in change the meaning of word so that every word be a command for my own part i would rather emile be rude than haughty that he should say do this a a request rather than please a a command what concern me be hi mean not hi word there be such a thing a excessive severity as well a excessive indulgence and both alike should be avoid if you let child suffer you risk their health and life you make them miserable now if you take too much pain to spare them every kind of uneasiness you be lay up much misery for them in the future you be make them delicate and oversensitive you be take them out of their place among men a place to which they must sooner or later return in spite of all your pain you will say i be fall into the same mistake a those bad father whom i blame for sacrifice the present happiness of their child to a future which may never be theirs not so for the liberty i give my pupil make up for the slight hardship to which he be expose i see little fellow play in the snow stiff and blue with cold scarcely able to stir a finger they could go and warm themselves if they choose but they do not choose if you force them to come in they would feel the harshness of constraint a hundredfold more than the sharpness of the cold then what become of your grievance shall i make your child miserable by expose him to hardships which he be perfectly ready to endure i secure hi present good by leave him hi freedom and hi future good by arm him against the evil he will have to bear if he have hi choice would he hesitate for a moment between you and me do you think any man can find true happiness elsewhere than in hi natural state and when you try to spare him all suffering be you not take him out of hi natural state indeed i maintain that to enjoy great happiness he must experience slight ill such be hi nature too much bodily prosperity corrupt the moral a man who know nothing of suffer would be incapable of tenderness towards hi fellowcreatures and ignorant of the joy of pity he would be hardhearted unsocial a very monster among men do you know the sure way to make your child miserable let him have everything he want for a hi want increase in proportion to the ease with which they be satisfy you will be compel sooner or later to refuse hi demand and this unlookedfor refusal will hurt him more than the lack of what he want he will want your stick first then your watch the bird that fly or the star that shine above him he will want all he set eye on and unless you be god himself how could you satisfy him man naturally consider all that he can get a hi own in this sense hobbes theory be true to a certain extent multiply both our wish and the mean of satisfy them and each will be master of all thus the child who have only to ask and have think himself the master of the universe he consider all men a hi slave and when you be at last compelled to refuse he take your refusal a an act of rebellion for he think he have only to command all the reason you give him while he be still too young to reason be so many pretence in hi eye they seem to him only unkindness the sense of injustice embitters hi disposition he hat every one though he have never felt grateful for kindness he resent all opposition how should i suppose that such a child can ever be happy he be the slave of anger a prey to the fierce passion happy he be a tyrant at once the base of slave and the most wretched of creature i have know child bring up like this who expect you to knock the house down to give them the weathercock on the steeple to stop a regiment on the march so that they might listen to the band when they could not get their way they scream and cried and would pay no attention to any one in vain everybody strive to please them a their desire be stimulate by the ease with which they get their own way they set their heart on impossibility and find themselves face to face with opposition and difficulty pain and grief scold sulk or in a rage they weep and cry all day were they really so greatly favoured weakness combine with love of power produce nothing but folly and suffer one spoilt child beat the table another whip the sea they may beat and whip long enough before they find contentment if their childhood be make wretched by these notion of power and tyranny what of their manhood when their relation with their fellowmen begin to grow and multiply they be use to find everything give way to them what a painful surprise to enter society and meet with opposition on every side to be crush beneath the weight of a universe which they expect to move at will their insolent manner their childish vanity only draw down upon them mortification scorn and mockery they swallow insult like water sharp experience soon teach them that they have realise neither their position nor their strength a they can not do everything they think they can do nothing they be daunt by unexpected obstacle degrade by the scorn of men they become base cowardly and deceitful and fall a far below their true level a they formerly soar above it let u come back to the primitive law nature have make child helpless and in need of affection do she make them to be obey and fear ha she give them an impose manner a stern eye a loud and threatening voice with which to make themselves fear i understand how the roaring of the lion strike terror into the other beast so that they tremble when they behold hi terrible mane but of all unseemly hateful and ridiculous sight be there ever anything like a body of statesman in their robe of office with their chief at their head bow down before a swaddled babe address him in pompous phrase while he cry and slaver in reply if we consider childhood itself be there anything so weak and wretched a a child anything so utterly at the mercy of those about it so dependent on their pity their care and their affection do it not seem a if hi gentle face and touch appearance be intend to interest every one on behalf of hi weakness and to make them eager to help him and what be there more offensive more unsuitable than the sight of a sulky or imperious child who command those about him and impudently assume the tone of a master towards those without whom he would perish on the other hand do you not see how child be fetter by the weakness of infancy do you not see how cruel it be to increase this servitude by obedience to our caprice by deprive them of such liberty a they have a liberty which they can scarcely abuse a liberty the loss of which will do so little good to them or u if there be nothing more ridiculous than a haughty child there be nothing that claim our pity like a timid child with the age of reason the child become the slave of the community then why forestall this by slavery in the home let this brief hour of life be free froma yoke which nature have not lay upon it leave the child the use of hi natural liberty which for a time at least secures him fromthe vice of the slave bring me those harsh master and those father who be the slave of their child bring them both with their frivolous objection and before they boast of their own method let them for once learn the method of nature i return to practical matter i have already say your child must not get what he ask but what he need footnote we must recognise that pain be often necessary pleasure be sometimes need so there be only one of the child desire which should never be comply with the desire for power hence whenever they ask for anything we must pay special attention to their motive in ask as far a possible give them everything they ask for provide it can really give them pleasure refuse everything they demand frommere caprice or love of power he must never act fromobedience but fromnecessity the very word obey and command will be exclude fromhi vocabulary still more those of duty and obligation but the word strength necessity weakness and constraint must have a large place in it before the age of reason it be impossible to form any idea of moral being or social relation so avoid as far a may be the use of word which express these idea lest the child at an early age should attach wrong idea to them idea which you can not or will not destroy when he be old the first mistaken idea he get into hi head be the germ of error and vice it be the first step that need watch act in such a way that while he only notice external object hi idea be confine to sensation let him only see the physical world around him if not you may be sure that either he will pay no heed to you at all or he will form fantastic idea of the moral world of which you prate idea which you will never efface as long a he live reason with child be locke chief maxim it be in the height of fashion at present and i hardly think it be justify by it result those child who have be constantly reason with strike me a exceedingly silly of all man faculty reason which be so to speak compound of all the rest be the last and choice growth and it be this you would use for the child early train to make a man reasonable be the cop stone of a good education and yet you profess to train a child through hi reason you begin at the wrong end you make the end the mean if child understand reason they would not need education but by talk to them fromtheir early age in a language they do not understand you accustom them to be satisfy with word to question all that be say to them to think themselves as wise a their teacher you train them to be argumentative and rebellious and whatever you think you gain frommotif of reason you really gain fromgreediness fear or vanity with which you be oblige to reinforce your reason most of the moral lesson which be and can be give to child may be reduce to this formula master you must not do that child why not master because it be wrong child wrong what be wrong master what be forbidden you child why be it wrong to do what be forbidden master you will be punish for disobedience child i will do it when no one be look master we shall watch you child i will hide master we shall ask you what you be do child i shall tell a lie master you must not tell lie child why must not i tell lie master because it be wrong etc that be the inevitable circle go beyond it and the child will not understand you what sort of use be there in such teaching i should greatly like to know what you would substitute for this dialogue it would have puzzle locke himself it be no part of a child business to know right and wrong to perceive the reason for a mans duty nature would have them child before they be men if we try to invert this order we shall produce a forced fruit immature and flavourless fruit which will be rotten before it be ripe we shall have young doctor and old child childhood have it own way of see thinking and feeling nothing be more foolish than to try and substitute our way and i should no more expect judgment in a tenyearold child than i should expect him to be five foot high indeed what use would reason be to him at that age it be the curb of strength and the child do not need the curb when you try to persuade your scholar of the duty of obedience you add to this socalled persuasion compulsion and threat or still bad flattery and bribe attract by selfishness or constrain by force they pretend to be convince by reason they see as soon a you do that obedience be to their advantage and disobedience to their disadvantage but a you only demand disagreeable thing of them and a it be always disagreeable to do anothers will they hide themselves so that they may do a they please persuade that they be do no wrong so long a they be not find out but ready if find out to own themselves in the wrong for fear of bad evils the reason for duty be beyond their age and there be not a man in the world who could make them really aware of it but the fear of punishment the hope of forgiveness importunity the difficulty of answer wring fromthem a many confession a you want and you think you have convince them when you have only weary or frighten them what do it all come to in the first place by impose on them a duty which they fail to recognise you make them disincline to submit to your tyranny and you turn away their love you teach them deceit falsehood and lying a a way to gain reward or escape punishment then by accustom them to conceal a secret motive under the cloak of an apparent one you yourself put into their hand the mean of deceive you of deprive you of a knowledge of their real character of answer you and other with empty word whenever they have the chance law you say though bind on conscience exercise the same constraint over grownup men that be so but what be these men but child spoil by education this be just what you should avoid use force with child and reason with men this be the natural order the wise man need no law treat your scholar accord to hi age put him in hi place fromthe first and keep him in it so that he no longer try to leave it then before he know what goodness be he will be practise it chief lesson give him no order at all absolutely none do not even let him think that you claim any authority over him let him only know that he be weak and you be strong that hi condition and yours put him at your mercy let this be perceive learned and felt let him early find upon hi proud neck the heavy yoke which nature have impose upon u the heavy yoke of necessity under which every finite be must bow let him find this necessity in thing not in the caprice footnote you may be sure the child will regard a caprice any will which oppose hi own or any will which he do not understand now the child do not understand anything which interfere with hi own fancy of man let the curb be force not authority if there be something he should not do do not forbid him but prevent him without explanation or reason what you give him give it at hi first word without prayer or entreaty above all without condition give willingly refuse unwillingly but let your refusal be irrevocable let no entreaty move you let your no once uttered be a wall of brass against which the child may exhaust hi strength some five or six time but in the end he will try no more to overthrow it thus you will make him patient equable calm and resign even when he do not get all he want for it be in man nature to bear patiently with the nature of thing but not with the illwill of another a child never rebel against there be none leave unless he think the reply be false moreover there be no middle course you must either make no demand on him at all or els you must fashion him to perfect obedience the bad education of all be to leave him hesitate between hi own will and yours constantly dispute whether you or he be master i would rather a hundred time that he be master it be very strange that ever since people begin to think about education they should have hit upon no other way of guide child than emulation jealousy envy vanity greediness base cowardice all the most dangerous passion passion ever ready to ferment ever prepare to corrupt the soul even before the body be fullgrown with every piece of precocious instruction which you try to force into their mind you plant a vice in the depth of their heart foolish teacher think they be do wonder when they be make their scholar wicked in order to teach them what goodness be and then they tell u seriously such be man yes such be man a you have make him every mean have be try except one the very one which might succeedwellregulated liberty do not undertake to bring up a child if you can not guide him merely by the law of what can or can not be the limit of the possible and the impossible be alike unknown to him so they can be extend or contract around him at your will without a murmur he be restrain urge on hold back by the hand of necessity alone he be make adaptable and teachable by the mere force of thing without any chance for vice to spring up in him for passion do not arise so long a they have accomplish nothing give your scholar no verbal lesson he should be teach by experience alone never punish him for he do not know what it be to do wrong never make him say forgive me for he do not know how to do you wrong wholly unmoral in hi action he can do nothing morally wrong and he deserve neither punishment nor reproof already i see the frightened reader compare this child with those of our time he be mistake the perpetual restraint impose upon your scholar stimulate their activity the more subdued they be in your presence the more boisterous they be as soon a they be out of your sight they must make amends to themselves in some way or other for the harsh constraint to which you subject them two schoolboy fromthe town will do more damage in the country than all the child of the village shut up a young gentleman and a young peasant in a room the former will have upset and smash everything before the latter have stir fromhi place why be that unless that the one hasten to misuse a moment licence while the other always sure of freedom do not use it rashly and yet the village child often flatter or constrain be still very far fromthe state in which i would have them keep let u lay it down a an incontrovertible rule that the first impulse of nature be always right there be no original sin in the human heart the how and why of the entrance of every vice can be trace the only natural passion be selflove or selfishness take in a wider sense this selfishness be good in itself and in relation to ourselves and a the child have no necessary relation to other people he be naturally indifferent to them hi selflove only become good or bad by the use make of it and the relation establish by it mean until the time be ripe for the appearance of reason that guide of selfishness the main thing be that the child shall do nothing because you be watch him or listen to him in a word nothing because of other people but only what nature ask of him then he will never do wrong i do not mean to say that he will never do any mischief never hurt himself never break a costly ornament if you leave it within hi reach he might do much damage without do wrong since wrongdoing depends on the harmful intention which will never be hi if once he mean to do harm hi whole education would be ruin he would be almost hopelessly bad greed consider some thing wrong which be not wrong in the eye of reason when you leave free scope to a child heedlessness you must put anything he could spoil out of hi way and leave nothing fragile or costly within hi reach let the room be furnish with plain and solid furniture no mirror china or useless ornament my pupil emile who be bring up in the country shall have a room just like a peasant why take such pain to adorn it when he will be so little in it i be mistaken however he will ornament it for himself and we shall soon see how but if in spite of your precaution the child contrives to do some damage if he break some useful article do not punish him for your carelessness do not even scold him let him hear no word of reproval do not even let him see that he have vex you behave just a if the thing have come to piece of itself you may consider you have do great thing if you have manage to hold your tongue may i venture at this point to state the great the most important the most useful rule of education it be do not save time but lose it i hope that everyday reader will excuse my paradox you can not avoid paradox if you think for yourself and whatever you may say i would rather fall into paradox than into prejudice the most dangerous period in human life lie between birth and the age of twelve it be the time when error and vice spring up while as yet there be no mean to destroy them when the mean of destruction be ready the root have go too deep to be pull up if the infant sprang at one bound fromit mother breast to the age of reason the present type of education would be quite suitable but it natural growth call for quite a different train the mind should be leave undisturbed till it faculty have develop for while it be blind it can not see the torch you offer it nor can it follow through the vast expanse of idea a path so faintly trace by reason that the best eye can scarcely follow it therefore the education of the early year should be merely negative it consist not in teach virtue or truth but in preserve the heart fromvice and fromthe spirit of error if only you could let well alone and get other to follow your example if you could bring your scholar to the age of twelve strong and healthy but unable to tell hi right hand fromhi leave the eye of hi understanding would be open to reason as soon a you begin to teach him free fromprejudice and free fromhabit there would be nothing in him to counteract the effect of your labour in your hand he would soon become the wise of men by do nothing to begin with you would end with a prodigy of education reverse the usual practice and you will almost always do right father and teacher who want to make the child not a child but a man of learn think it never too soon to scold correct reprove threaten bribe teach and reason do good than they be reasonable and do not reason with your pupil more especially do not try to make him approve what he dislike for if reason be always connect with disagreeable matter you make it distasteful to him you discredit it at an early age in a mind not yet ready to understand it exercise hi body hi limbs hi sens hi strength but keep hi mind idle as long a you can distrust all opinion which appear before the judgment to discriminate between them restrain and ward off strange impression and to prevent the birth of evil do not hasten to do well for goodness be only possible when enlighten by reason regard all delay a so much time gain you have achieve much you approach the boundary without loss leave childhood to ripen in your child in a word beware of give anything they need today if it can be defer without danger to tomorrow there be another point to be consider which confirm the suitability of this method it be the child individual bent which must be thoroughly know before we can choose the fit moral training every mind have it own form in accordance with which it must be control and the success of the pain take depend largely on the fact that he be control in this way and no other oh wise man take time to observe nature watch your scholar well before you say a word to him first leave the germ of hi character free to show itself do not constrain him in anything the good to see him a he really be do you think this time of liberty be waste on the contrary your scholar will be the good employ for this be the way you yourself will learn not to lose a single moment when time be of more value if however you begin to act before you know what to do you act at random you may make mistake and must retrace your step your haste to reach your goal will only take you far fromit do not imitate the miser who lose much l he should lose a little sacrifice a little time in early childhood and it will be repay you with usury when your scholar be old the wise physician do not hastily give prescription at first sight but he study the constitution of the sick man before he prescribe anything the treatment be begin later but the patient be cure while the hasty doctor kill him but where shall we find a place for our child so a to bring him up a a senseless be an automaton shall we keep him in the moon or on a desert island shall we remove him fromhuman society will he not always have around him the sight and the pattern of the passion of other people will he never see child of hi own age will he not see hi parent hi neighbour hi nurse hi governess hi manservant hi tutor himself who after all will not be an angel here we have a real and serious objection but do i tell you that an education accord to nature would be an easy task oh men be it my fault that you have make all good thing difficult i admit that i be aware of these difficulty perhaps they be insuperable but nevertheless it be certain that we do to some extent avoid them by try to do so i be show what we should try to attain i do not say we can attain it but i do say that whoever come near to it be near to success remember you must be a man yourself before you try to train a man you yourself must set the pattern he shall copy while the child be still unconscious there be time to prepare hi surroundings so that nothing shall strike hi eye but what be fit for hi sight gain the respect of every one begin to win their heart so that they may try to please you you will not be master of the child if you can not control every one about him and this authority will never suffice unless it rest upon respect for your goodness there be no question of squander one mean and give money right and leave i never know money win love you must neither be harsh nor niggardly nor must you merely pity misery when you can relieve it but in vain will you open your purse if you do not open your heart along with it the heart of other will always be close to you you must give your own time attention affection your very self for whatever you do people always perceive that your money be not you there be proof of kindly interest which produce more result and be really more useful than any gift how many of the sick and wretched have more need of comfort than of charity how many of the oppressed need protection rather than money reconcile those who be at strife prevent lawsuit incline child to duty father to kindness promote happy marriage prevent annoyance freely use the credit of your pupil parent on behalf of the weak who can not obtain justice the weak who be oppress by the strong be just human kindly do not give alms alone give charity work of mercy do more than money for the relief of suffer love other and they will love you serve them and they will serve you be their brother and they will be your child this be one reason why i want to bring up emile in the country far fromthose miserable lacqueys the most degraded of men except their master far fromthe vile moral of the town whose gilded surface make them seductive and contagious to child while the vice of peasant unadorned and in their naked grossness be more fitted to repel than to seduce when there be no motive for imitate them in the village a tutor will have much more control over the thing he wish to show the child hi reputation hi word hi example will have a weight they would never have in the town he be of use to every one so every one be eager to oblige him to win hi esteem to appeal before the disciple what the master would have him be if vice be not correct public scandal be at least avoided which be all that our present purpose require cease to blame other for your own fault child be corrupt less by what they see than by your own teaching with your endless preach moralising and pedantry for one idea you give your scholar believe it to be good you give them twenty more which be good for nothing you be full of what be go on in your own mind and you fail to see the effect you produce on theirs in the continual flow of word with which you overwhelm them do you think there be none which they get hold of in a wrong sense do you suppose they do not make their own comment on your longwinded explanation that they do not find material for the construction of a system they can understandone which they will use against you when they get the chance listen to a little fellow who have just be under instruction let him chatter freely ask question and talk at hi ease and you will be surprise to find the strange form your argument have assume in hi mind he confuse everything and turn everything topsyturvy you be vexed and grieve by hi unforeseen objection he reduce you to be silent yourself or to silence him and what can he think of silence in one who be so fond of talk if ever he gain this advantage and be aware of it farewell education fromthat moment all be lose he be no longer try to learn he be try to refute you zealous teacher be simple sensible and reticent be in no hurry to act unless to prevent the action of other again and again i say reject if it may be a good lesson for fear of give a bad one beware of play the tempter in this world which nature intend a an earthly paradise for men and do not attempt to give the innocent child the knowledge of good and evil since you can not prevent the child learning by what he see outside himself restrict your own effort to impress those example on hi mind in the form best suit for him the explosive passion produce a great effect upon the child when he see them their outward expression be very marked he be strike by this and hi attention be arrest anger especially be so noisy in it rage that it be impossible not to perceive it if you be within reach you need not ask yourself whether this be an opportunity for a pedagogue to frame a fine disquisition what no fine disquisition nothing not a word let the child come to you impress by what he have see he will not fail to ask you question the answer be easy it be draw fromthe very thing which have appeal to hi sens he see a flushed face flash eye a threatening gesture he hear cry everything show that the body be ill at ease tell him plainly without affectation or mystery this poor man be ill he be in a fever you may take the opportunity of give him in a few word some idea of disease and it effect for that too belong to nature and be one of the bond of necessity which he must recognise by mean of this idea which be not false in itself may he not early acquire a certain aversion to give way to excessive passion which he regard a disease and do you not think that such a notion give at the right moment will produce a more wholesome effect than the most tedious sermon but consider the after effect of this idea you have authority if ever you find it necessary to treat the rebellious child a a sick child to keep him in hi room in bed if need be to diet him to make him afraid of hi grow vice to make him hate and dread them without ever regard a a punishment the strict measure you will perhaps have to use for hi recovery if it happen that you yourself in a moment heat depart fromthe calm and selfcontrol which you should aim at do not try to conceal your fault but tell him frankly with a gentle reproach my dear you have hurt me moreover it be a matter of great importance that no notice should be take in hi presence of the quaint saying which result fromthe simplicity of the idea in which he be bring up nor should they be quote in a way he can understand a foolish laugh may destroy six month work and do irreparable damage for life i can not repeat too often that to control the child one must often control oneself i picture my little emile at the height of a dispute between two neighbour go up to the fierce of them and say in a tone of pity you be ill i be very sorry for you this speech will no doubt have it effect on the spectator and perhaps on the disputant without laughter scolding or praise i should take him away willing or no before he could see this result or at least before he could think about it and i should make haste to turn hi thought to other thing so that he would soon forget all about it i do not propose to enter into every detail but only to explain general rule and to give illustration in case of difficulty i think it be impossible to train a child up to the age of twelve in the midst of society without give him some idea of the relation between one man and another and of the morality of human action it be enough to delay the development of these idea as long a possible and when they can no longer be avoid to limit them to present need so that he may neither think himself master of everything nor do harm to other without know or care there be calm and gentle character which can be lead a long way in their first innocence without any danger but there be also stormy disposition whose passion develop early you must hasten to make men of them l you should have to keep them in chain our first duty be to ourselves our first feeling be centre on self all our instinct be at first direct to our own preservation and our own welfare thus the first notion of justice spring not fromwhat we owe to other but fromwhat be due to u here be another error in popular method of education if you talk to child of their duty and not of their right you be begin at the wrong end and tell them what they can not understand what can not be of any interest to them if i have to train a child such a i have just describe i should say to myself a child never attack people footnote a child should never be allow to play with grownup people a if they be hi inferior nor even a if they be only hi equal if he venture to strike any one in earnest be it only the footman be it the hangman himself let the sufferer return hi blow with interest so that he will not want to do it again i have see silly woman incite child to rebellion encourage them to hit people allow themselves to be beat and laugh at the harmless blow never thinking that those blow be in intention the blow of a murderer and that the child who desire to beat people now will desire to kill them when he be grow up only thing and he soon learn by experience to respect those old and strong than himself thing however do not defend themselves therefore the first idea he need be not that of liberty but of property and that he may get this idea he must have something of hi own it be useless to enumerate hi clothes furniture and plaything although he use these he know not how or why he have come by them to tell him they be give him be little good for give implies have so here be property before hi own and it be the principle of property that you want to teach him moreover give be a convention and the child a yet have no idea of convention i hope my reader will note in this and many other case how people think they have teach child thoroughly when they have only thrust on them word which have no intelligible meaning to them footnote this be why most child want to take back what they have give and cry if they can not get it they do not do this when once they know what a gift be only they be more careful about give thing away we must therefore go back to the origin of property for that be where the first idea of it must begin the child living in the country will have get some idea of field work eye and leisure suffice for that and he will have both in every age and especially in childhood we want to create to copy to produce to give all the sign of power and activity he will hardly have see the gardener at work twice sow plant and grow vegetable before he will want to garden himself accord to the principle i have already lay down i shall not thwart him on the contrary i shall approve of hi plan share hi hobby and work with him not for hi pleasure but my own at least so he think i shall be hi undergardener and dig the ground for him till hi arm be strong enough to do it he will take possession of it by plant a bean and this be surely a more sacred possession and one more worthy of respect than that of nunes balboa who take possession of south america in the name of the king of spain by plant hi banner on the coast of the southern sea we water the bean every day we watch them come up with the great delight day by day i increase this delight by say those belong to you to explain what that word belong mean i show him how he have give hi time hi labour and hi trouble hi very self to it that in this ground there be a part of himself which he can claim against all the world a he could withdraw hi arm fromthe hand of another man who want to keep it against hi will one fine day he hurry up with hi wateringcan in hi hand what a scene of woe ala all the bean be pull up the soil be dig over you can scarcely find the place oh what have become of my labour my work the beloved fruit of my care and effort who have steal my property who have take my bean the young heart revolt the first feeling of injustice brings it sorrow and bitterness tear come in torrent the unhappy child fill the air with cry and groan i share hi sorrow and anger we look around u we make inquiry at last we discover that the gardener do it we send for him but we be greatly mistake the gardener hear our complaint begin to complain loud than we what gentleman be it you who spoil my work i have sow some maltese melon the seed be give me a something quite out of the common and i mean to give you a treat when they be ripe but you have plant your miserable bean and destroy my melon which be come up so nicely and i can never get any more you have behave very badly to me and you have deprive yourselves of the pleasure of eat most delicious melon jean jacques my poor robert you must forgive u you have give your labour and your pain to it i see we be wrong to spoil your work but we will send to malta for some more seed for you and we will never dig the ground again without find out if some one els have be beforehand with u robert well gentleman you need not trouble yourselves for there be no more waste ground i dig what my father till every one do the same and all the land you see have be occupy time out of mind emile mr robert do people often lose the seed of maltese melon robert no indeed sir we do not often find such silly little gentleman a you no one meddle with hi neighbour garden every one respect other people work so that hi own may be safe emile but i have not get a garden robert i dont care if you spoil mine i wont let you walk in it for you see i do not mean to lose my labour jean jacques could not we suggest an arrangement with this kind robert let him give my young friend and myself a corner of hi garden to cultivate on condition that he have half the crop robert you may have it free but remember i shall dig up your bean if you touch my melon in this attempt to show how a child may be teach certain primitive idea we see how the notion of property go back naturally to the right of the first occupier to the result of hi work that be plain and simple and quite within the child grasp fromthat to the right of property and exchange there be but a step after which you must stop short you also see that an explanation which i can give in write in a couple of page may take a year in practice for in the course of moral idea we can not advance too slowly nor plant each step too firmly young teacher pray consider this example and remember that your lesson should always be in deed rather than word for child soon forget what they say or what be say to them but not what they have do nor what have be do to them such teaching should be give a i have say sooner or later a the scholar disposition gentle or turbulent require it the way of use it be unmistakable but to omit no matter of importance in a difficult business let u take another example your illtempered child destroys everything he touch do not vex yourself put anything he can spoil out of hi reach he break the thing he be use do not be in a hurry to give him more let him feel the want of them he break the window of hi room let the wind blow upon him night and day and do not be afraid of hi catch cold it be well to catch cold than to be reckless never complain of the inconvenience he cause you but let him feel it first at last you will have the window mend without say anything he break them again then change your plan tell him dryly and without anger the window be mine i take pain to have them put in and i mean to keep them safe then you will shut him up in a dark place without a window at this unexpected proceeding he cry and howl no one heed soon he get tired and change hi tone he lament and sigh a servant appear the rebel begs to be let out without seek any excuse for refuse the servant merely say i too have window to keep and go away at last when the child have be there several hour long enough to get very tired of it long enough to make an impression on hi memory some one suggests to him that he should offer to make term with you so that you may set him free and he will never break window again that be just what he want he will send and ask you to come and see him you will come he will suggest hi plan and you will agree to it at once say that be a very good idea it will suit u both why didnt you think of it sooner then without ask for any affirmation or confirmation of hi promise you will embrace him joyfully and take him back at once to hi own room consider this agreement as sacred a if he have confirm it by a formal oath what idea do you think he will form fromthese proceeding a to the fulfilment of a promise and it usefulness if i be not greatly mistake there be not a child upon earth unless he be utterly spoilt already who could resist this treatment or one who would ever dream of break window again on purpose follow out the whole train of thought the naughty little fellow hardly think when he be make a hole for hi bean that he be hew out a cell in which hi own knowledge would soon imprison him footnote moreover if the duty of keep hi word be not establish in the child mind by it own utility the child grow consciousness would soon impress it on him a a law of conscience a an innate principle only require suitable experience for it development this first outline be not sketch by man it be engrave on the heart by the author of all justice take away the primitive law of contract and the obligation impose by contract and there be nothing left of human society but vanity and empty show he who only keep hi word because it be to hi own profit be hardly more pledged than if he have give no promise at all this principle be of the utmost importance and deserve to be thoroughly study for man be now begin to be at war with himself we be now in the world of moral the door to vice be open deceit and falsehood be bear along with convention and duty a soon a we can do what we ought not to do we try to hide what we ought not to have do as soon a selfinterest make u give a promise a great interest may make u break it it be merely a question of do it with impunity we naturally take refuge in concealment and falsehood a we have not be able to prevent vice we must punish it the sorrow of life begin with it mistake i have already say enough to show that child should never receive punishment merely a such it should always come a the natural consequence of their fault thus you will not exclaim against their falsehood you will not exactly punish them for lie but you will arrange that all the ill effect of lie such a not be believe when we speak the truth or be accuse of what we have not do in spite of our protest shall fall on their head when they have tell a lie but let u explain what lie mean to the child there be two kind of lie one concern an accomplished fact the other concern a future duty the first occur when we falsely deny or assert that we do or do not do something or to put it in general term when we knowingly say what be contrary to facts the other occurs when we promise what we do not mean to perform or in general term when we profess an intention which we do not really mean to carry out these two kind of lie be sometimes find in combination footnote thus the guilty person accuse of some evil deed defend himself by assert that he be a good man hi statement be false in itself and false in it application to the matter in hand but their difference be my present business he who feel the need of help fromother he who be constantly experience their kindness have nothing to gain by deceive them it be plainly to hi advantage that they should see thing a they be l they should mistake hi interest it be therefore plain that lie with regard to actual fact be not natural to child but lie be make necessary by the law of obedience since obedience be disagreeable child disobey as far a they can in secret and the present good of avoid punishment or reproof outweighs the remoter good of speak the truth under a free and natural education why should your child lie what have he to conceal fromyou you do not thwart him you do not punish him you demand nothing fromhim why should he not tell everything to you as simply a to hi little playmate he can not see anything more risky in the one course than in the other the lie concern duty be even less natural since promise to do or refrain fromdo be conventional agreement which be outside the state of nature and detract fromour liberty moreover all promise make by child be in themselves void when they pledge themselves they do not know what they be do for their narrow vision can not look beyond the present a child can hardly lie when he make a promise for he be only think how he can get out of the present difficulty any mean which have not an immediate result be the same to him when he promise for the future he promise nothing and hi imagination be a yet incapable of project him into the future while he live in the present if he could escape a whipping or get a packet of sweet by promise to throw himself out of the window tomorrow he would promise on the spot this be why the law disregard all promise make by minor and when father and teacher be strict and demand that promise shall be keep it be only when the promise refers to something the child ought to do even if he have make no promise the child can not lie when he make a promise for he do not know what he be do when he make hi promise the case be different when he break hi promise which be a sort of retrospective falsehood for he clearly remember make the promise but he fail to see the importance of keep it unable to look into the future he can not foresee the result of thing and when he break hi promise he do nothing contrary to hi stage of reason children lie be therefore entirely the work of their teacher and to teach them to speak the truth be nothing less than to teach them the art of lie in your zeal to rule control and teach them you never find sufficient mean at your disposal you wish to gain fresh influence over their mind by baseless maxim by unreasonable precept and you would rather they know their lesson and tell lie than leave them ignorant and truthful we who only give our scholar lesson in practice who prefer to have them good rather than clever never demand the truth l they should conceal it and never claim any promise l they should be tempt to break it if some mischief have be do in my absence and i do not know who do it i shall take care not to accuse emile nor to say did you do it footnote nothing could be more indiscreet than such a question especially if the child be guilty then if he think you know what he have do he will think you be set a trap for him and this idea can only set him against you if he think you do not know he will say to himself why should i make my fault know and here we have the first temptation to falsehood a the direct result of your foolish question for in so do what should i do but teach him to deny it if hi difficult temperament compels me to make some agreement with him i will take good care that the suggestion always come fromhim never fromme that when he undertake anything he have always a present and effective interest in fulfil hi promise and if he ever fail this lie will bring down on him all the unpleasant consequence which he see arise fromthe natural order of thing and not fromhi tutor vengeance but far fromhave recourse to such cruel measure i feel almost certain that emile will not know for many year what it be to lie and that when he do find out he will be astonish and unable to understand what can be the use of it it be quite clear that the less i make hi welfare dependent on the will or the opinion of other the le be it to hi interest to lie when we be in no hurry to teach there be no hurry to demand and we can take our time so a to demand nothing except under fit condition then the child be train himself in so far a he be not be spoil but when a fool of a tutor who do not know how to set about hi business be always make hi pupil promise first this and then that without discrimination choice or proportion the child be puzzle and overburden with all these promise and neglect forgets or even scorn them and consider them a so many empty phrase he make a game of make and break promise would you have him keep hi promise faithfully be moderate in your claim upon him the detailed treatment i have just give to lie may be apply in many respect to all the other duty impose upon child whereby these duty be make not only hateful but impracticable for the sake of a show of preach virtue you make them love every vice you instil these vice by forbid them would you have them pious you take them to church till they be sick of it you teach them to gabble prayer until they long for the happy time when they will not have to pray to god to teach them charity you make them give alms a if you scorn to give yourself it be not the child but the master who should give however much he love hi pupil he should vie with him for this honour he should make him think that he be too young to deserve it almsgiving be the deed of a man who can measure the worth of hi gift and the need of hi fellowmen the child who know nothing of these can have no merit in give he give without charity without kindness he be almost ashamed to give for to judge by your practice and hi own he think it be only child who give and that there be no need for charity when we be grow up observe that the only thing child be set to give be thing of which they do not know the value bit of metal carry in their pocket for which they have no further use a child would rather give a hundred coin than one cake but get this prodigal giver to distribute what be dear to him hi toy hi sweet hi own lunch and we shall soon see if you have make him really generous people try yet another way they soon restore what he give to the child so that he get use to give everything which he know will come back to him i have scarcely see generosity in child except of these two type give what be of no use to them or what they expect to get back again arrange thing say locke so that experience may convince them that the most generous giver get the big share that be to make the child superficially generous but really greedy he add that child will thus form the habit of liberality yes a usurer liberality which expect cent per cent but when it be a question of real give goodbye to the habit when they do not get thing back they will not give it be the habit of the mind not of the hand that need watch all the other virtue teach to child be like this and to preach these baseless virtue you waste their youth in sorrow what a sensible sort of education teacher have do with these sham be good and kind let your example sink into your scholar memory till they be old enough to take it to heart rather than hasten to demand deed of charity frommy pupil i prefer to perform such deed in hi presence even deprive him of the mean of imitate me a an honour beyond hi year for it be of the utmost importance that he should not regard a mans duty a merely those of a child if when he see me help the poor he ask me about it and it be time to reply to hi question footnote it must be understood that i do not answer hi question when he want that would be to subject myself to hi will and to place myself in the most dangerous state of dependence that ever a tutor be in i shall say my dear boy the rich only exist through the goodwill of the poor so they have promise to fee those who have not enough to live on either in good or labour then you promise to do this certainly i be only master of the wealth that pass through my hand on the condition attach to it ownership after this talk and we have see how a child may be bring to understand it another than emile would be tempt to imitate me and behave like a rich man in such a case i should at least take care that it be do without ostentation i would rather he rob me of my privilege and hid himself to give it be a fraud suitable to hi age and the only one i could forgive in him i know that all these imitative virtue be only the virtue of a monkey and that a good action be only morally good when it be do a such and not because of other but at an age when the heart do not yet feel anything you must make child copy the deed you wish to grow into habit until they can do them with understanding and for the love of what be good man imitate a do the beast the love of imitating be well regulate by nature in society it become a vice the monkey imitate man whom he fear and not the other beast which he scorn he think what be do by hi better must be good among ourselves our harlequin imitate all that be good to degrade it and bring it into ridicule know their owner baseness they try to equal what be good than they be or they strive to imitate what they admire and their bad taste appear in their choice of model they would rather deceive other or win applause for their own talent than become wiser or good imitation have it root in our desire to escape fromourselves if i succeed in my undertaking emile will certainly have no such wish so we must dispense with any seem good that might arise fromit examine your rule of education you will find them all topsyturvy especially in all that concern virtue and morals the only moral lesson which be suit for a childthe most important lesson for every time of lifeis this never hurt anybody the very rule of welldoing if not subordinate to this rule be dangerous false and contradictory who be there who do no good every one do some good the wicked as well a the righteous he make one happy at the cost of the misery of a hundred and hence spring all our misfortune the noble virtue be negative they be also the most difficult for they make little show and do not even make room for that pleasure so dear to the heart of man the thought that some one be please with u if there be a man who do no harm to hi neighbour what good must he have accomplish what a bold heart what a strong character it need it be not in talk about this maxim but in try to practise it that we discover both it greatness and it difficulty footnote the precept never hurt anybody imply the great possible independence of human society for in the social state one man good be another man evil this relation be part of the nature of thing it be inevitable you may apply this test to man in society and to the hermit to discover which be best a distinguish author say none but the wicked can live alone i say none but the good can live alone this proposition if less sententious be true and more logical than the other if the wicked be alone what evil would he do it be among hi fellow that he lay hi snare for other if they wish to apply this argument to the man of property my answer be to be find in the passage to which this note be append this will give you some slight idea of the precaution i would have you take in give child instruction which can not always be refuse without risk to themselves or other or the far great risk of the formation of bad habit which would be difficult to correct later on but be sure this necessity will not often arise with child who be properly bring up for they can not possibly become rebellious spiteful untruthful or greedy unless the seed of these vice be sow in their heart what i have just say applies therefore rather to the exception than the rule but the oftener child have the opportunity of quit their proper condition and contract the vice of men the oftener will these exception arise those who be bring up in the world must receive more precocious instruction than those who be bring up in retirement so this solitary education would be preferable even if it do nothing more than leave childhood time to ripen there be quite another class of exception those so gift by nature that they rise above the level of their age a there be men who never get beyond infancy so there be other who be never so to speak child they be men almost frombirth the difficulty be that these case be very rare very difficult to distinguish while every mother who know that a child may be a prodigy be convince that her child be that one they go far they mistake the common sign of growth for mark of exceptional talent liveliness sharp saying romp amuse simplicity these be the characteristic mark of this age and show that the child be a child indeed be it strange that a child who be encourage to chatter and allow to say anything who be restrain neither by consideration nor convention should chance to say something clever were he never to hit the mark hi case would be strange than that of the astrologer who among a thousand error occasionally predict the truth they lie so often say henr that at last they say what be true if you want to say something clever you have only to talk long enough may providence watch over those fine folk who have no other claim to social distinction the fine thought may spring froma child brain or rather the best word may drop fromhi lip just a diamond of great worth may fall into hi hand while neither the thought nor the diamond be hi own at that age neither can be really hi the child saying do not mean to him what they mean to u the idea he attach to them be different hi idea if indeed he have any idea at all have neither order nor connection there be nothing sure nothing certain in hi thought examine your socalled prodigy now and again you will discover in him extreme activity of mind and extraordinary clearness of thought more often this same mind will seem slack and spiritless a if wrap in mist sometimes he go before you sometimes he will not stir one moment you would call him a genius another a fool you would be mistake in both he be a child an eaglet who soar aloft for a moment only to drop back into the nest treat him therefore accord to hi age in spite of appearance and beware of exhaust hi strength by overmuch exercise if the young brain grows warm and begin to bubble let it work freely but do not heat it any further lest it lose it goodness and when the first gas have be give off collect and compress the rest so that in after year they may turn to lifegiving heat and real energy if not your time and your pain will be waste you will destroy your own work and after foolishly intoxicate yourself with these heady fume you will have nothing leave but an insipid and worthless wine silly child grow into ordinary men i know no generalisation more certain than this it be the most difficult thing in the world to distinguish between genuine stupidity and that apparent and deceitful stupidity which be the sign of a strong character at first sight it seem strange that the two extreme should have the same outward sign and yet it may well be so for at an age when man have as yet no true idea the whole difference between the genius and the rest consist in this the latter only take in false idea while the former finding nothing but false idea receive no idea at all in this he resemble the fool the one be fit for nothing the other find nothing fit for him the only way of distinguish between them depend upon chance which may offer the genius some idea which he can understand while the fool be always the same a a child the young cato be take for an idiot by hi parent he be obstinate and silent and that be all they perceive in him it be only in sulla antechamber that hi uncle discover what be in him have he never find hi way there he might have pass for a fool till he reach the age of reason had caesar never live perhaps this same cato who discern hi fatal genius and foretell hi great scheme would have pass for a dreamer all hi day those who judge child hastily be apt to be mistake they be often more childish than the child himself i know a middleaged man footnote the abbe de condillac whose friendship i esteem an honour who be reckon a fool by hi family all at once he make hi name a a philosopher and i have no doubt posterity will give him a high place among the great thinker and the profound metaphysicians of hi day hold childhood in reverence and do not be in any hurry to judge it for good or ill leave exceptional case to show themselves let their quality be test and confirm before special method be adopt give nature time to work before you take over her business l you interfere with her dealing you assert that you know the value of time and be afraid to waste it you fail to perceive that it be a great waste of time to use it ill than to do nothing and that a child ill taught be far fromvirtue than a child who have learn nothing at all you be afraid to see him spend hi early year do nothing what be it nothing to be happy nothing to run and jump all day he will never be so busy again all hi life long plato in hi republic which be consider so stern teach the child only through festival game song and amusement it seem a if he have accomplish hi purpose when he have teach them to be happy and seneca speaking of the roman lads in olden day say they be always on their foot they be never teach anything which keep them sit were they any the bad for it in manhood do not be afraid therefore of this socalled idleness what would you think of a man who refuse to sleep l he should waste part of hi life you would say he be mad he be not enjoy hi life he be rob himself of part of it to avoid sleep he be hasten hi death remember that these two case be alike and that childhood be the sleep of reason the apparent ease with which child learn be their ruin you fail to see that this very facility prove that they be not learn their shining polish brain reflect a in a mirror the thing you show them but nothing sink in the child remember the word and the idea be reflect back hi hearer understand them but to him they be meaningless although memory and reason be wholly different faculty the one do not really develop apart fromthe other before the age of reason the child receives image not idea and there be this difference between them image be merely the picture of external object while idea be notion about those object determine by their relation an image when it be recall may exist by itself in the mind but every idea imply other idea when we image we merely perceive when we reason we compare our sensation be merely passive our notion or idea spring froman active principle which judge the proof of this will be give later i maintain therefore that a child be incapable of judge they have no true memory they retain sound form sensation but rarely idea and still more rarely relation you tell me they acquire some rudiment of geometry and you think you prove your case not so it be mine you prove you show that far frombe able to reason themselves child be unable to retain the reasoning of other for if you follow the method of these little geometrician you will see they only retain the exact impression of the figure and the term of the demonstration they can not meet the slight new objection if the figure be reverse they can do nothing all their knowledge be on the sensationlevel nothing have penetrate to their understand their memory be little good than their other power for they always have to learn over again when they be grow up what they learn a child i be far fromthink however that child have no sort of reason footnote i have notice again and again that it be impossible in write a lengthy work to use the same word always in the same sense there be no language rich enough to supply term and expression sufficient for the modification of our idea the method of define every term and constantly substitute the definition for the term define looks well but it be impracticable for how can we escape fromour vicious circle definition would be all very well if we do not use word in the making of them in spite of this i be convince that even in our poor language we can make our mean clear not by always use word in the same sense but by take care hat every time we use a word the sense in which we use it be sufficiently indicate by the sense of the context so that each sentence in which the word occur act a a sort of definition sometimes i say child be incapable of reason sometimes i say they reason cleverly i must admit that my word be often contradictory but i do not think there be any contradiction in my idea on the contrary i think they reason very well with regard to thing that affect their actual and sensible wellbeing but people be mistake a to the extent of their information and they attribute to them knowledge they do not possess and make them reason about thing they can not understand another mistake be to try to turn their attention to matter which do not concern them in the least such a their future interest their happiness when they be grow up the opinion people will have of them when they be menterms which be absolutely meaningless when address to creature who be entirely without foresight but all the forced study of these poor little wretch be direct towards matter utterly remote fromtheir mind you may judge how much attention they can give to them the pedagogue who make a great display of the teach they give their pupil be pay to say just the opposite yet their action show that they think just a i do for what do they teach word word word among the various science they boast of teach their scholar they take good care never to choose those which might be really useful to them for then they would be compel to deal with thing and would fail utterly the science they choose be those we seem to know when we know their technical termsheraldry geography chronology languages etc study so remote fromman and even more remote fromthe child that it be a wonder if he can ever make any use of any part of them you will be surprise to find that i reckon the study of language among the useless lumber of education but you must remember that i be speak of the study of the early year and whatever you may say i do not believe any child under twelve or fifteen ever really acquire two language if the study of language be merely the study of word that be of the symbol by which language express itself then this might be a suitable study for child but language a they change the symbol also modify the idea which the symbol express mind be form by language thought take their colour fromit idea reason alone be common to all every language have it own form a difference which may be partly cause and partly effect of difference in national character this conjecture appear to be confirm by the fact that in every nation under the sun speech follow the change of manner and be preserve or alter along with them by use the child acquire one of these different form and it be the only language he retain till the age of reason to acquire two language he must be able to compare their idea and how can he compare idea he can barely understand everything may have a thousand meaning to him but each idea can only have one form so he can only learn one language you assure me he learn several language i deny it i have see those little prodigy who be suppose to speak half a dozen language i have hear them speak first in german then in latin french or italian true they use half a dozen different vocabulary but they always speak german in a word you may give child a many synonym a you like it be not their language but their word that you change they will never have but one language to conceal their deficiency teacher choose the dead language in which we have no long any judge whose authority be beyond dispute the familiar use of these tongue disappear long ago so they be content to imitate what they find in book and they call that talk if the master greek and latin be such poor stuff what about the child they have scarcely learn their primer by heart without understand a word of it when they be set to translate a french speech into latin word then when they be more advanced they piece together a few phrase of cicero for prose or a few line of vergil for verse then they think they can speak latin and who will contradict them in any study whatsoever the symbol be of no value without the idea of the thing symbolise yet the education of the child in confined to those symbol while no one ever succeed in make him understand the thing signify you think you be teach him what the world be like he be only learn the map he be teach the name of town country river which have no existence for him except on the paper before him i remember see a geography somewhere which begin with what be the worlda sphere of cardboard that be the child geography i maintain that after two year work with the globe and cosmography there be not a single tenyearold child who could find hi way fromparis to saint denis by the help of the rule he have learn i maintain that not one of these child could find hi way by the map about the path on hi father estate without get lose these be the young doctor who can tell u the position of pekin ispahan mexico and every country in the world you tell me the child must be employ on study which only need eye that may be but if there be any such study they be unknown to me it be a still more ridiculous error to set them to study history which be consider within their grasp because it be merely a collection of fact but what be mean by this word fact do you think the relation which determine the fact of history be so easy to grasp that the corresponding idea be easily develop in the child mind do you think that a real knowledge of event can exist apart fromthe knowledge of their cause and effect and that history have so little relation to word that the one can be learn without the other if you perceive nothing in a man action beyond merely physical and external movement what do you learn fromhistory absolutely nothing while this study rob of all that make it interest give you neither pleasure nor information if you want to judge action by their moral bearing try to make these moral bearing intelligible to your scholar you will soon find out if they be old enough to learn history remember reader that he who speak to you be neither a scholar nor a philosopher but a plain man and a lover of truth a man who be pledge to no one party or system a hermit who mix little with other men and have less opportunity of imbibe their prejudice and more time to reflect on the thing that strike him in hi intercourse with them my argument be base less on theory than on fact and i think i can find no good way to bring the fact home to you than by quote continually some example fromthe observation which suggest my argument i have go to spend a few day in the country with a worthy mother of a family who take great pain with her child and their education one morning i be present while the eldest boy have hi lesson hi tutor who have take great pain to teach him ancient history begin upon the story of alexander and light on the wellknown anecdote of philip the doctor there be a picture of it and the story be well worth study the tutor worthy man make several reflection which i do not like with regard to alexander courage but i do not argue with him lest i should lower him in the eye of hi pupil at dinner they do not fail to get the little fellow talk french fashion the eager spirit of a child of hi age and the confident expectation of applause make him say a number of silly thing and among them fromtime to time there be thing to the point and these make people forget the rest at last come the story of philip the doctor he tell it very distinctly and prettily after the usual meed of praise demand by hi mother and expect by the child himself they discuss what he have say most of them blame alexander rashness some of them follow the tutor example praise hi resolution which show me that none of those present really saw the beauty of the story for my own part i say if there be any courage or any steadfastness at all in alexander conduct i think it be only a piece of bravado then every one agree that it be a piece of bravado i be get angry and would have reply when a lady sit beside me who have not hitherto spoken bent towards me and whisper in my ear jean jacques say she say no more they will never understand you i look at her i recognise the wisdom of her advice and i hold my tongue several thing make me suspect that our young professor have not in the least understood the story he tell so prettily after dinner i take hi hand in mine and we go for a walk in the park when i have question him quietly i discover that he admire the vaunted courage of alexander more than any one but in what do you suppose he think this courage consist merely in swallow a disagreeable drink at a single draught without hesitation and without any sign of dislike not a fortnight before the poor child have be make to take some medicine which he could hardly swallow and the taste of it be still in hi mouth death and death by poison be for him only disagreeable sensation and senna be hi only idea of poison i must admit however that alexander resolution have make a great impression on hi young mind and he be determine that next time he have to take medicine he would be an alexander without enter upon explanation which be clearly beyond hi grasp i confirm him in hi praiseworthy intention and return home smile to myself over the great wisdom of parent and teacher who expect to teach history to child such word a king emperor war conquest law and revolution be easily put into their mouth but when it be a question of attach clear idea to these word the explanation be very different fromour talk with robert the gardener i feel sure some reader dissatisfy with that say no more jean jacques will ask what i really saw to admire in the conduct of alexander poor thing if you need tell how can you comprehend it alexander believe in virtue he stake hi head he stake hi own life on that faith hi great soul be fit to hold such a faith to swallow that draught be to make a noble profession of the faith that be in him never do mortal man recite a finer creed if there be an alexander in our own day show me such deed if child have no knowledge of word there be no study that be suitable for them if they have no real idea they have no real memory for i do not call that a memory which only recall sensation what be the use of inscribe on their brain a list of symbol which mean nothing to them they will learn the symbol when they learn the thing signify why give them the useless trouble of learn them twice over and yet what dangerous prejudice be you implant when you teach them to accept a knowledge word which have no meaning for them the first meaningless phrase the first thing take for grant on the word of another person without see it use for himself this be the beginning of the ruin of the child judgment he may dazzle the eye of fool long enough before he recover fromsuch a loss footnote the learning of most philosopher be like the learning of child vast erudition result less in the multitude of idea than in a multitude of image date name place all object isolate or unconnected with idea be merely retain in the memory for symbol and we rarely recall any of these without see the right or left page of the book in which we read it or the form in which we first saw it most science be of this kind till recently the science of our time be another matter study and observation be thing of the past we dream and the dream of a bad night be give to u a philosophy you will say i too be a dreamer i admit it but i do what the other fail to do i give my dream a dream and leave the reader to discover whether there be anything in them which may prove useful to those who be awake no if nature have give the child this plasticity of brain which fit him to receive every kind of impression it be not that you should imprint on it the name and date of king the jargon of heraldry the globe and geography all those word without present meaning or future use for the child which flood of word overwhelms hi sad and barren childhood but by mean of this plasticity all the idea he can understand and use all that concern hi happiness and will some day throw light upon hi duty should be trace at an early age in indelible character upon hi brain to guide him to live in such a way a befits hi nature and hi power without the study of book such a memory a the child may possess be not left idle everything he see and hear make an impression on him he keep a record of men saying and doings and hi whole environment be the book fromwhich he unconsciously enrich hi memory till hi judgment be able to profit by it to select these object to take care to present him constantly with those he may know to conceal fromhim those he ought not to know this be the real way of train hi early memory and in this way you must try to provide him with a storehouse of knowledge which will serve for hi education in youth and hi conduct throughout life true this method do not produce infant prodigy nor will it reflect glory upon their tutor and governess but it produce men strong rightthinking men vigorous both in mind and body men who do not win admiration a child but honour a men emile will not learn anything by heart not even fables not even the fable of la fontaine simple and delightful a they be for the word be no more the fable than the word of history be history how can people be so blind a to call fable the child system of moral without consider that the child be not only amuse by the apologue but mislead by it he be attract by what be false and he miss the truth and the mean adopt to make the teaching pleasant prevent him profit by it men may be teach by fable child require the naked truth all child learn la fontaines fable but not one of them understand them it be just as well that they do not understand for the morality of the fable be so mixed and so unsuitable for their age that it would be more likely to incline them to vice than to virtue more paradox you exclaim paradox they may be but let u see if there be not some truth in them i maintain that the child do not understand the fable he be teach for however you try to explain them the teaching you wish to extract fromthem demand idea which he can not grasp while the poetical form which make it easy to remember make it hard to understand so that clearness be sacrifice to facility without quote the host of wholly unintelligible and useless fable which be teach to child because they happen to be in the same book a the other let u keep to those which the author seem to have write specially for child in the whole of la fontaines work i only know five or six fable conspicuous for childlike simplicity i will take the first of these a an example for it be one whose moral be most suitable for all age one which child get hold of with the least difficulty which they have most pleasure in learn one which for this very reason the author have place at the beginning of hi book if hi object be really to delight and instruct child this fable be hi masterpiece let u go through it and examine it briefly the fox and the crow afable maitre corbeau sur un arbre perch mr crow perch on a treemr what do that word really mean what do it mean before a proper noun what be it meaning here what be a crow what be un arbre perch we do not say on a tree perch but perch on a tree so we must speak of poetical inversion we must distinguish between prose and verse tenait dans son bec un fromage hold a cheese in hi beakwhat sort of a cheese swiss brie or dutch if the child have never see crow what be the good of talk about them if he have see crow will he believe that they can hold a cheese in their beak your illustration should always be take fromnature maitre renard par lodeur alleche mr fox attract by the smellanother master but the title suit the foxwho be master of all the trick of hi trade you must explain what a fox be and distinguish between the real fox and the conventional fox of the fable alleche the word be obsolete you will have to explain it you will say it be only use in verse perhaps the child will ask why people talk differently in verse how will you answer that question alleche par lodeur dun fromage the cheese be hold in hi beak by a crow perch on a tree it must indeed have smelt strong if the fox in hi thicket or hi earth could smell it this be the way you train your pupil in that spirit of right judgment which reject all but reasonable argument and be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood in other tale lui tient a peu pres ce langage speak to him after this fashionce langage so foxes talk do they they talk like crow mind what you be about oh wise tutor weigh your answer before you give it it be more important than you suspect eh bonjour monsieur le corbeau goodday mr crowmr the child see this title laugh to scorn before he know it be a title of honour those who say monsieur du corbeau will find their work cut out for them to explain that du que vous etes joli que vous me semblez beau how handsome you be how beautiful in my eyesmere pad the child find the same thing repeat twice over in different word be learn to speak carelessly if you say this redundance be a device of the author a part of the foxs scheme to make hi praise seem all the great by hi flow of word that be a valid excuse for me but not for my pupil sans mentir si votre ramage without lie if your songwithout lie so people do tell lie sometimes what will the child think of you if you tell him the fox only say sans mentir because he be lie se rapport a votre plumage answer to your fine feathersanswered what do that mean try to make the child compare quality so different a those of song and plumage you will see how much he understand vous seriez le phenix de hotes de ce bois you would be the phoenix of all the inhabitant of this woodthe phoenix what be a phoenix all of a sudden we be flounder in the lie of antiquitywe be on the edge of mythology the inhabitant of this wood what figurative language the flatterer adopt the grand style to add dignity to hi speech to make it more attractive will the child understand this cunning do he know how could he possibly know what be mean by grand style and simple style a ces mot le corbeau ne se send pa de joie at these word the crow be beside himself with delightto realise the full force of this proverbial expression we must have experience very strong feeling et pour montrer sa belle voix and to show hi fine voiceremember that the child to understand this line and the whole fable must know what be mean by the crow fine voice il ouvre un large bec laisse tomber sa proie he open hi wide beak and drop hi preythis be a splendid line it very sound suggest a picture i see the great big ugly gap beak i hear the cheese crashing through the branch but this kind of beauty be throw away upon child le renard sen saisit et dit mon bon monsieur the fox catch it and say my dear sirso kindness be already folly you certainly waste no time in teach your child apprenez que tout flatteur you must learn that every flatterera general maxim the child can make neither head nor tail of it vit au depens de celui qui lecoute live at the expense of the person who listen to hi flatteryno child of ten ever understand that ce lecon vaut bien un fromage sans doute no doubt this lesson be well worth a cheesethis be intelligible and it meaning be very good yet there be few child who could compare a cheese and a lesson few who would not prefer the cheese you will therefore have to make them understand that this be say in mockery what subtlety for a child le corbeau honteux et confus the crow ashamed and confuseda nothing pleonasm and there be no excuse for it this time jura mais un peu tard quon ne ly prendrait plus swore but rather too late that he would not be catch in that way againswore what master will be such a fool a to try to explain to a child the meaning of an oath what a host of detail but much more would be need for the analysis of all the idea in this fable and their reduction to the simple and elementary idea of which each be compose but who think this analysis necessary to make himself intelligible to child who of u be philosopher enough to be able to put himself in the child place let u now proceed to the moral should we teach a sixyearold child that there be people who flatter and lie for the sake of gain one might perhaps teach them that there be people who make fool of little boy and laugh at their foolish vanity behind their back but the whole thing be spoil by the cheese you be teach them how to make another drop hi cheese rather than how to keep their own this be my second paradox and it be not less weighty than the former one watch child learn their fable and you will see that when they have a chance of apply them they almost always use them exactly contrary to the author mean instead of be on their guard against the fault which you would prevent or cure they be dispose to like the vice by which one take advantage of anothers defect in the above fable child laugh at the crow but they all love the fox in the next fable you expect them to follow the example of the grasshopper not so they will choose the ant they do not care to abase themselves they will always choose the principal partthis be the choice of selflove a very natural choice but what a dreadful lesson for child there could be no monster more detestable than a harsh and avaricious child who realise what he be ask to give and what he refuse the ant do more she teach him not merely to refuse but to revile in all the fable where the lion play a part usually the chief part the child pretend to be the lion and when he have to preside over some distribution of good thing he take care to keep everything for himself but when the lion be overthrow by the gnat the child be the gnat he learn how to sting to death those whom he dare not attack openly fromthe fable of the sleek dog and the starving wolf he learn a lesson of licence rather than the lesson of moderation which you profess to teach him i shall never forget see a little girl weep bitterly over this tale which have be told her a a lesson in obedience the poor child hat to be chain up she felt the chain chafe her neck she be cry because she be not a wolf so fromthe first of these fable the child learn the base flattery fromthe second cruelty fromthe third injustice fromthe fourth satire fromthe fifth insubordination the last of these lesson be no more suitable for your pupil than for mine though he have no use for it what result do you expect to get fromyour teach when it contradict itself but perhaps the same system of moral which furnishes me with objection against the fable supply you with a many reason for keep to them society require a rule of morality in our word it also require a rule of morality in our deed and these two rule be quite different the former be contain in the catechism and it be leave there the other be contain in la fontaines fable for child and hi tale for mother the same author do for both let u make a bargain m de la fontaine for my own part i undertake to make your book my favourite study i undertake to love you and to learn fromyour fable for i hope i shall not mistake their meaning a to my pupil permit me to prevent him study any one of them till you have convince me that it be good for him to learn thing threefourths of which be unintelligible to him and until you can convince me that in those fable he can understand he will never reverse the order and imitate the villain instead of take warn fromhi dupe when i thus get rid of children lesson i get rid of the chief cause of their sorrow namely their book reading be the curse of childhood yet it be almost the only occupation you can find for child emile at twelve year old will hardly know what a book be but you say he must at least know how to read when reading be of use to him i admit he must learn to read but till then he will only find it a nuisance if child be not to be require to do anything a a matter of obedience it follow that they will only learn what they perceive to be of real and present value either for use or enjoyment what other motive could they have for learn the art of speaking to our absent friend of hear their word the art of let them know at first hand our feeling our desire and our longing be an art whose usefulness can be make plain at any age how be it that this art so useful and pleasant in itself have become a terror to child because the child be compel to acquire it against hi will and to use it for purpose beyond hi comprehension a child have no great wish to perfect himself in the use of an instrument of torture but make it a mean to hi pleasure and soon you will not be able to keep him fromit people make a great fuss about discover the beat way to teach child to read they invent bureaux footnote translator notethe bureau be a sort of case contain letter to be put together to form word it be a favourite device for the teaching of reading and give it name to a special method call the bureaumethod of learn to read and card they turn the nursery into a printer shop locke would have them teach to read by mean of dice what a fine idea and the pity of it there be a good way than any of those and one which be generally overlookedit consists in the desire to learn arouse this desire in your scholar and have do with your bureau and your diceany method will serve present interest that be the motive power the only motive power that take u far and safely sometimes emile receive note of invitation fromhi father or mother hi relation or friend he be invite to a dinner a walk a boat expedition to see some public entertainment these note be short clear plain and well write some one must read them to him and he can not always find anybody when want no more consideration be show to him than he himself show to you yesterday time pass the chance be lose the note be read to him at last but it be too late oh if only he have know how to read he receive other note so short so interesting he would like to try to read them sometimes he get help sometimes none he do hi best and at last he make out half the note it be something about go tomorrow to drink creamwhere with whom he can not tellhow hard he try to make out the rest i do not think emile will need a bureau shall i proceed to the teaching of write no i be ashamed to toy with these trifle in a treatise on education i will just add a few word which contain a principle of great importance it be thiswhat we be in no hurry to get be usually obtain with speed and certainty i be pretty sure emile will learn to read and write before he be ten just because i care very little whether he can do so before he be fifteen but i would rather he never learn to read at all than that this art should be acquire at the price of all that make read useful what be the use of read to him if he always hat it id imprimis cavere oportebit ne studia qui amare nondum potest oderit et amaritudinem semel perceptam etiam ultra rude annos reformidetquintil the more i urge my method of let well alone the more objection i perceive against it if your pupil learn nothing fromyou he will learn fromother if you do not instil truth he will learn falsehood the prejudice you fear to teach him he will acquire fromthose about him they will find their way through every one of hi sens they will either corrupt hi reason before it be fully develop or hi mind will become torpid through inaction and will become engrossed in material thing if we do not form the habit of thinking a child we shall lose the power of thinking for the rest of our life i fancy i could easily answer that objection but why should i answer every objection if my method itself answer your objection it be good if not it be good for nothing i continue my explanation if in accordance with the plan i have sketch you follow rule which be just the opposite of the establish practice if instead of take your scholar far afield instead of wander with him in distant place in faroff land in remote century in the end of the earth and in the very heavens themselves you try to keep him to himself to hi own concern you will then find him able to perceive to remember and even to reason this be natures order a the sentient be becomes active hi discernment develop along with hi strength not till hi strength be in excess of what be need for selfpreservation be the speculative faculty develop the faculty adapt for use this superfluous strength for other purpose would you cultivate your pupil intelligence cultivate the strength it be mean to control give hi body constant exercise make it strong and healthy in order to make him good and wise let him work let him do thing let him run and shout let him be always on the go make a man of him in strength and he will soon be a man in reason of course by this method you will make him stupid if you be always give him direction always say come here go there stop do this dont do that if your head always guide hi hand hi own mind will become useless but remember the condition we lay down if you be a mere pedant it be not worth your while to read my book it be a lamentable mistake to imagine that bodily activity hinder the working of the mind a if these two kind of activity ought not to advance hand in hand and a if the one be not intend to act a guide to the other there be two class of men who be constantly engage in bodily activity peasant and savage and certainly neither of these pay the least attention to the cultivation of the mind peasant be rough coarse and clumsy savage be note not only for their keen sens but for great subtility of mind speaking generally there be nothing duller than a peasant or sharp than a savage what be the cause of this difference the peasant have always do a he be tell what hi father do before him what he himself have always do he be the creature of habit he spend hi life almost like an automaton on the same task habit and obedience have take the place of reason the case of the savage be very different he be tie to no one place he have no prescribe task no superior to obey he know no law but hi own will he be therefore force to reason at every step he take he can neither move nor walk without consider the consequence thus the more hi body be exercise the more alert be hi mind hi strength and hi reason increase together and each help to develop the other oh learn tutor let u see which of our two scholar be most like the savage and which be most like the peasant your scholar be subject to a power which be continually give him instruction he act only at the word of command he dare not eat when he be hungry nor laugh when he be merry nor weep when he be sad nor offer one hand rather than the other nor stir a foot unless he be tell to do it before long he will not venture to breathe without order what would you have him think about when you do all the thinking for him he rest securely on your foresight why should he think for himself he know you have undertake to take care of him to secure hi welfare and he feel himself free fromthis responsibility hi judgment relies on yours what you have not forbid that he do know that he run no risk why should he learn the sign of rain he know you watch the cloud for him why should he time hi walk he know there be no fear of your let him miss hi dinner hour he eat till you tell him to stop he stop when you tell him to do so he do not attend to the teaching of hi own stomach but yours in vain do you make hi body soft by inaction hi understanding do not become subtle far fromit you complete your task of discredit reason in hi eye by make him use such reason power a he have on the thing which seem of least importance to him a he never find hi reason any use to him he decide at last that it be useless if he reason badly he will be find fault with nothing worse will happen to him and he have be find fault with so often that he pay no attention to it such a common danger no longer alarm him yet you will find he have a mind he be quick enough to chatter with the woman in the way i speak of further back but if he be in danger if he must come to a decision in difficult circumstance you will find him a hundredfold more stupid and silly than the son of the rough labourer a for my pupil or rather nature pupil he have be train fromthe outset to be as selfreliant a possible he have not form the habit of constantly seek help fromother still less of display hi store of learn on the other hand he exercise discrimination and forethought he reason about everything that concern himself he do not chatter he act not a word do he know of what be go on in the world at large but he know very thoroughly what affect himself a he be always stir he be compel to notice many thing to recognise many effect he soon acquire a good deal of experience nature not man be hi schoolmaster and he learn all the quicker because he be not aware that he have any lesson to learn so mind and body work together he be always carry out hi own idea not those of other people and thus he unite think and action a he grow in health and strength he grow in wisdom and discernment this be the way to attain later on to what be generally consider incompatible though most great men have achieve it strength of body and strength of mind the reason of the philosopher and the vigour of the athlete young teacher i be set before you a difficult task the art of control without precept and do everything without do anything at all this art be i confess beyond your year it be not calculate to display your talent nor to make your value know to your scholar parent but it be the only road to success you will never succeed in make wise men if you do not first make little imp of mischief this be the education of the spartan they be not teach to stick to their book they be set to steal their dinner be they any the bad for it in after life ever ready for victory they crush their foe in every kind of warfare and the prating athenian be as much afraid of their word a of their blow when education be most carefully attend to the teacher issue hi order and think himself master but it be the child who be really master he use the task you set him to obtain what he want fromyou and he can always make you pay for an hour industry by a week complaisance you must always be make bargain with him these bargain suggest in your fashion but carry out in hi always follow the direction of hi own fancy especially when you be foolish enough to make the condition some advantage he be almost sure to obtain whether he fulfil hi part of the bargain or not the child be usually much quick to read the master thought than the master to read the child feeling and that be a it should be for all the sagacity which the child would have devote to selfpreservation have he be leave to himself be now devote to the rescue of hi native freedom fromthe chain of hi tyrant while the latter who have no such press need to understand the child sometimes find that it pay him good to leave him in idleness or vanity take the opposite course with your pupil let him always think he be master while you be really master there be no subjection so complete a that which preserve the form of freedom it be thus that the will itself be take captive be not this poor child without knowledge strength or wisdom entirely at your mercy be you not master of hi whole environment so far a it affect him can not you make of him what you please hi work and play hi pleasure and pain be they not unknown to him under your control no doubt he ought only to do what he want but he ought to want to do nothing but what you want him to do he should never take a step you have not foreseen nor utter a word you could not foretell then he can devote himself to the bodily exercise adapt to hi age without brutalise hi mind instead of develop hi cunning to evade an unwelcome control you will then find him entirely occupy in get the best he can out of hi environment with a view to hi present welfare and you will be surprise by the subtlety of the mean he devise to get for himself such thing a he can obtain and to really enjoy thing without the aid of other people idea you leave him master of hi own wish but you do not multiply hi caprice when he only do what he want he will soon only do what he ought and although hi body be constantly in motion so far a hi sensible and present interest be concern you will find him develop all the reason of which he be capable far good and in a manner much well fit for him than in purely theoretical study thus when he do not find you continually thwart him when he no longer distrust you no longer have anything to conceal fromyou he will neither tell you lie nor deceive you he will show himself fearlessly a he really be and you can study him at your ease and surround him with all the lesson you would have him learn without awake hi suspicion neither will he keep a curious and jealous eye on your own conduct nor take a secret delight in catch you at fault it be a great thing to avoid this one of the child first object be a i have say to find the weak spot in it ruler though this lead to spitefulness it do not arise fromit but fromthe desire to evade a disagreeable control overburden by the yoke lay upon him he try to shake it off and the fault he find in hi master give him a good opportunity for this still the habit of spy out fault and delight in them grow upon people clearly we have stop another of the spring of vice in emile heart have nothing to gain frommy fault he will not be on the watch for them nor will he be tempt to look out for the fault of other all these method seem difficult because they be new to u but they ought not to be really difficult i have a right to assume that you have the knowledge require for the business you have choose that you know the usual course of development of the human thought that you can study mankind and man that you know beforehand the effect on your pupil will of the various object suit to hi age which you put before him you have the tool and the art to use them be you not master of your trade you speak of childish caprice you be mistaken children caprice be never the work of nature but of bad discipline they have either obey or give order and i have say again and again they must do neither your pupil will have the caprice you have teach him it be fair you should bear the punishment of your own fault but how can i cure them do you say that may still be do by good conduct on your own part and great patience i once undertake the charge of a child for a few week he be accustom not only to have hi own way but to make every one els do a he please he be therefore capricious the very first day he want to get up at midnight to try how far he could go with me when i be sound asleep he jump out of bed get hi dressinggown and wake me up i get up and light the candle which be all he want after a quarter of an hour he become sleepy and go back to bed quite satisfy with hi experiment two day later he repeat it with the same success and with no sign of impatience on my part when he kiss me a he lay down i say to him very quietly my little dear this be all very well but do not try it again hi curiosity be arouse by this and the very next day he do not fail to get up at the same time and wake me to see whether i should dare to disobey him i ask what he want and he tell me he could not sleep so much the bad for you i reply and i lay quiet he seem perplexed by this way of speaking he felt hi way to the flint and steel and try to strike a light i could not help laugh when i hear him strike hi finger convinced at last that he could not manage it he bring the steel to my bed i tell him i do not want it and i turn my back to him then he begin to rush wildly about the room shout sing make a great noise knock against chair and table but take however good care not to hurt himself seriously but scream loudly in the hope of alarm me all this have no effect but i perceive that though he be prepare for scold or anger he be quite unprepared for indifference however he be determine to overcome my patience with hi own obstinacy and he continue hi racket so successfully that at last i lose my temper i foresee that i should spoil the whole business by an unseemly outburst of passion i determine on another course i get up quietly go to the tinder box but could not find it i ask him for it and he give it me delight to have win the victory over me i strike a light light the candle take my young gentleman by the hand and lead him quietly into an adjoining dressingroom with the shutter firmly fasten and nothing he could break i leave him there without a light then lock him in i go back to my bed without a word what a noise there be that be what i expect and take no notice at last the noise cease i listen heard him settle down and i be quite easy about him next morning i enter the room at daybreak and my little rebel be lie on a sofa enjoy a sound and much need sleep after hi exertion the matter do not end there hi mother heard that the child have spend a great part of the night out of bed that spoil the whole thing her child be as good a dead find a good chance for revenge he pretend to be ill not see that he would gain nothing by it they send for the doctor unluckily for the mother the doctor be a practical joker and to amuse himself with her terror he do hi best to increase them however he whisper to me leave it to me i promise to cure the child of want to be ill for some time to come a a matter of fact he prescribe bed and dieting and the child be hand over to the apothecary i sigh to see the mother cheat on every hand except by me whom she hat because i do not deceive her after pretty severe reproach she tell me her son be delicate that he be the sole heir of the family hi life must be preserve at all cost and she would not have him contradict in that i thoroughly agree with her but what she mean by contradict be not obey him in everything i saw i should have to treat the mother a i have treat the son madam i say coldly i do not know how to educate the heir to a fortune and what be more i do not mean to study that art you can take that a settle i be want for some day longer and the father smooth thing over the mother write to the tutor to hasten hi return and the child find he get nothing by disturb my rest nor yet by be ill decide at last to get good and to go to sleep you can form no idea of the number of similar caprice to which the little tyrant have subject hi unlucky tutor for hi education be carry on under hi mother eye and she would not allow her son and heir to be disobey in anything whenever he want to go out you must be ready to take him or rather to follow him and he always take good care to choose the time when he know hi tutor be very busy he wish to exercise the same power over me and to avenge himself by day for have to leave me in peace at night i gladly agree and begin by show plainly how pleased i be to give him pleasure after that when it be a matter of cure him of hi fancy i set about it differently in the first place he must be show that he be in the wrong this be not difficult know that child think only of the present i take the easy advantage which foresight give i take care to provide him with some indoor amusement of which he be very fond just when he be most occupied with it i go and suggest a short walk and he send me away i insist but he pay no attention i have to give in and he take note of this sign of submission the next day it be my turn a i expect he get tire of hi occupation i however pretend to be very busy that be enough to decide him he come to drag me frommy work to take him at once for a walk i refuse he persist no i say when i do what you want you teach me how to get my own way i shall not go out very well he reply eagerly i shall go out by myself a you please and i return to my work he put on hi thing rather uneasily when he saw i do not follow hi example when he be ready he come and make hi bow i bow too he try to frighten me with story of the expedition he be go to make to hear him talk you would think he be go to the world end quite unmoved i wish him a pleasant journey he become more and more perplexed however he put a good face on it and when he be ready to go out he tell hi foot man to follow him the footman who have hi instruction reply that he have no time and that he be busy carry out my order and he must obey me first for the moment the child be take aback how could he think they would really let him go out alone him who in hi own eye be the most important person in the world who think that everything in heaven and earth be wrap up in hi welfare however he be begin to feel hi weakness he perceive that he should find himself alone among people who know nothing of him he saw beforehand the risk he would run obstinacy alone sustain him very slowly and unwillingly he go downstairs at last he go out into the street console himself a little for the harm that might happen to himself in the hope that i should be hold responsible for it this be just what i expect all be arrange beforehand and a it mean some sort of public scene i have get hi father consent he have scarcely go a few step when he hear first on this side then on that all sort of remark about himself what a pretty little gentleman neighbour where be he go all alone he will get lose i will ask him into our house take care you dont dont you see he be a naughty little boy who have be turn out of hi own house because he be good for nothing you must not stop naughty boy let him go where he like well well the good god take care of him i should be sorry if anything happen to him a little further on he meet some young urchin of about hi own age who tease him and make fun of him the further he get the more difficulty he find alone and unprotected he be at the mercy of everybody and he find to hi great surprise that hi shoulder knot and hi gold lace command no respect however i have get a friend of mine who be a stranger to him to keep an eye on him unnoticed by him this friend follow him step by step and in due time he speak to him the role like that of sbrigani in pourceaugnac require an intelligent actor and it be play to perfection without make the child fearful and timid by inspire excessive terror he make him realise so thoroughly the folly of hi exploit that in half an hour time he bring him home to me ashamed and humble and afraid to look me in the face to put the finishing touch to hi discomfiture just a he be come in hi father come down on hi way out and meet him on the stair he have to explain where he have be and why i be not with him footnote in a case like this there be no danger in ask a child to tell the truth for he know very well that it can not be hid and that if he venture to tell a lie he would be find out at once the poor child would gladly have sink into the earth hi father do not take the trouble to scold him at length but say with more severity than i should have expect when you want to go out by yourself you can do so but i will not have a rebel in my house so when you go take good care that you never come back a for me i receive him somewhat gravely but without blame and without mockery and for fear he should find out we have be play with him i decline to take him out walk that day next day i be well pleased to find that he pass in triumph with me through the very same people who have mock him the previous day when they meet him out by himself you may be sure he never threaten to go out without me again by these mean and other like them i succeed during the short time i be with him in get him to do everything i want without bid him or forbid him to do anything without preach or exhortation without weary him with unnecessary lesson so he be pleased when i speak to him but when i be silent he be frighten for he know there be something amiss and he always get hi lesson fromthe thing itself but let u return to our subject the body be strengthen by this constant exercise under the guidance of nature herself and far frombrutalise the mind this exercise develop in it the only kind of reason of which young child be capable the kind of reason most necessary at every age it teach u how to use our strength to perceive the relation between our own and neighbouring body to use the natural tool which be within our reach and adapt to our sens be there anything silly than a child bring up indoors under hi mother eye who in hi ignorance of weight and resistance try to uproot a tall tree or pick up a rock the first time i find myself outside geneva i try to catch a galloping horse and i throw stone at mont saleve two league away i be the laugh stock of the whole village and be suppose to be a regular idiot at eighteen we be teach in our natural philosophy the use of the lever every village boy of twelve know how to use a lever good than the clever mechanician in the academy the lesson the scholar learn fromone another in the playground be worth a hundredfold more than what they learn in the classroom watch a cat when she come into a room for the first time she go fromplace to place she sniff about and examines everything she be never still for a moment she be suspicious of everything till she have examine it and find out what it be it be the same with the child when he begin to walk and enters so to speak the room of the world around him the only difference be that while both use sight the child use hi hand and the cat that subtle sense of smell which nature have bestow upon it it be this instinct rightly or wrongly educate which make child skilful or clumsy quick or slow wise or foolish man primary natural goal be therefore to measure himself against hi environment to discover in every object he see those sensible quality which may concern himself so hi first study be a kind of experimental physic for hi own preservation he be turn away fromthis and send to speculative study before he have find hi proper place in the world while hi delicate and flexible limb can adjust themselves to the body upon which they be intend to act while hi sens be keen and a yet free from
