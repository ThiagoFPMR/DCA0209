upon the shore of barcelona between the plank of a ship which have suffer wreck there appear a if it have be a parcel of cloth cover with weed which be perceive by some fisherman they take it into their bark and carry it along the shore about the space of two mile where under the shade of some tree they clean away the weed and mud and find that it be a man in a trance who be almost past sense and without life these fisher move with compassion kindle a fire with some branch cut from an old oak and he who have be so near the losing of hi life now recover it let them know what countryman he be by hi complaint discover hi admiration by hi look and the feeling he have of the good which they have do him by the fire with which he have to acknowledge it nature do the accustomed office of a pitiful mother send hi blood to restore the more enfeebled part and have bring him almost to hi former strength he be about to have reveal himself but think it do not fit in so strange a fortune he conceal hi birth and name only say that hi ship suffer wreck in the sea and seizing of these plank which the wave have cast upon the shore he be two day float amongst the billow of the sea who

where the violence of the stroke have a it be plough up hi tomb he think himself bury hi return he say be from italy and the occasion of hi voyage the indulgence of the jubilee which be while clement the eighth sit a pope and sigh much amongst the broken speech of hi story he let them understand that he miss a companion of hi travel of whom there be no news to be have a it seldom happen that those who do free u from bodily misfortune can also ease those of the mind so he rest this day within one of their cabin while the cold night descend all crown with star do impart unto mortal creature rest in conformity with the quality of their life give desire unto the poor care unto the rich complaint unto the sad unto the contented sleep and jealousy to the amorous in the midst thereof he hear a lyre play upon and accord with a voice which in sing complain of a shepherdess cruelty the pilgrim although weary lovemusic more than rest and go out of hi cabin into a meadow from whence see about a dozen house and among some osier the author of those plaint call him from a distance the singer reply fearfully but the pale light of the moon reveal the secret of the night make him see that it be a poor man and without arm he then show him a plank lie amongst reed over a little brook give it murmuring unto the solitariness of the place and silence of the night which when he have pass they salute one the other courteously especially he which come for stranger be always courteous out of necessity and they sit down together upon the grass no sooner have the pilgrim inform himself of the name of the village of the lord thereof and how far it be distant from barcelona when they saw two men approach who instead of salute them present two arquebus to their face and instill a thousand fear in their heart the stranger tell them that they could take nothing from them but hi life which he esteem little and six hour ago much less the other say that he be the son of a seaman between a fisherman and a pilot and that all hi good consist of this hi instrument with which he do charm away hi care the soldier do not appear to desire their clothes because one be of ship canvas and the other of coarse cloth and there be no robber who be not liberal of that which be of no worth but they entreat them to conduct them to the village which in regard to the uncertainty of the way they could not find but in a great time the fisherman tell them that in recompense for their courtesy he would advise them not to go forasmuch a the inhabitant be a warlike people and do not willingly lodge men of their fashion and that it would be impossible to escape from their hand if they be discover because upon the sounding of the first alarm all the other village would answer them from whom would come a multitude of labourer who with diver arm would stop the passage and know the way so well that there be neither brook tree nor rock which they have not at their finger end to this counsel the bandoleer reply that they be not alone but there be above fifty in their troupe fight under the colour of a catalonian knight who have be injure by another more mighty than he both in mean and parentage although not in strength reason or courage hardly have they end these word when by the light of the star they saw the arm of the squadron and it captain of whom they have speak and now be join all together they lodge by force in various house of the village the pilgrim curious to learn a be all those who travel in foreign country mingle himself amongst the soldier who in no way dislike hi company but instead invite him to supper after which the floor serve them for bed they entertain one the other with discourse until the slow dawn then at the end of february become daybreak now that they know the pilgrim history and he be desirous to learn from them their own turbulent narrative hi feature and comprehension be please to them one among them name ramond tell it in this manner in this famous city which with a wonderful greatness opposeth italy and astonisheth africa there be bear a lady of noble parentage who have be a firebrand unto her country have no small conformity with greek helen her name be florinda her beauty heavenly and her spirit divine and she have attain unto year fit for marriage two knight equal in youth greatness of mean and nobleness of blood do seek her lovewith like hope but unlike favour lovenatural inclination a sympathy of manner or an influence of the star do constrain florinda to lovedoricles and hate filander who to shorten hi way between hope and possession and to prevent hi rival demand her in marriage of her parent who would willingly have give the respect which they might unto the intercessor and hi merit have they not find that florinda felt differently on gain knowledge of the husband which they propound to her they loveher tenderly and would not constrain her with rigour but speak frankly to filander tell him that she would not agree to it although they have persuade her a master and command a parent filander augment hi loveby her dislike find out that the lovewhich florinda bore for doricles be the cause of the disdain she bore him the idea of revenge come to him and he form a resolution to remove from the world the obstacle of hi design notwithstanding the scandal and evil that so brutal an enterprise might bring he arm himself with such company a he think good a he be not unprovided with friend nor want servant at such time a he think he might find doricles at hi mistress door or in the street by her house but hi rival dubious of hi plan always go well accompany and good arm a one who do not think that he could have a good friend than hi sword having cause a ladder to be bring upon the eve of a feast unto her garden wall by that mean to speak with her it happen that filander come into that street and perform hi usual office of spy heard florinda speak to doricles and saw her give him a nosegay of jasmine which she have in her hand with embracing more insupportable to him than favourable to doricles he charge those which keep the gate and begin with them a cruel combat doricles come down and search philander in the midst of hi enemy wound him and put him to flight for a favoured lover be a a gambler who win and in all hazard be always master of the fortune of hi adversary doricles go away victorious out of the street while filanders lovewhich have turn to disdain become by this encounter a mortal hatred then either side increase their band the fire of their anger kindle all their parent and although they every day speak together a if they have no quarrel they fail not to fight every night when they meet in this scandal doricles lose the enjoying of hi mistress filander her favour she her renown and their parent their honour time increase the loveof the one while the other hatred increase hi desire of revenge and of the small pleasure which the two lover have filander have the least it seem well to him in this business to rely upon hi industry for the effecting of that which hi strength would be want have then learn that florinda be to take her pleasure at sea in a bark he hide two or three day before a brigantine in a creek not far from the shore in which he apparel himself like a turk with some other of hi friend for accomplice in amorous enterprise be seldom want and with necessary rower attend hi mistress the meuxin which be the tower where the watch of barcelona be keep have discover that no enemy sail in all the sea in the meantime the contented florinda with her companion be not go from the shore a league when the counterfeit frigate hoist sail and beat the water with her oar overtook her bark the mariner whereof look for nothing less than such a surprise could not resolve either to fly or to defend themselves but contrariwise a the fearful bird see the proud merlin come fiercely stoop upon her be accustom to attend her with couched wing acknowledge by the turkish sail the power of their enemy which be upon them and quit their oar and fear which with a cold shivering run through all their vein give them no time to discern their deceit finally they board them and two or three of the disguised turk leap into the bark ravish away the new helen who be carry into the brigantine and find herself in the arm of filander the counterfeit word of these pirate who call him murat rais make those who remain free in the bark believe that he be the author of this robbery and see that they take nothing but florinda they return again to barcelona recount the disgrace in every street and place where they come with more cry and tear than word which come to the ear of her parent cause more grief in them then can be tell principally in her sorrowful mother who bewail her loss with a passion more befitting her sex than a generous courage mount scout in vain spur up and down the coast but filander who have bring florinda into a private garden house have take away hi turban and hi turkish disguise declare unto her that the incomparable force of hi lovehave constrain him to have recourse to this deviousness and do enjoy her beauty with assurance although she take heaven the tree and the fountain to witness the violence which be use on her of no less consideration be doricles pain who full of mortal sorrow be a thousand time by the sea side ready to imitate the despair of those nymph which saw europa ravish nevertheless and as well to oblige unto him hi mistress parent and to satisfy himself he buy a ship of an aragonese which have bring in wheat and load it with silk velvet and other merchandise give hi sail to the wind turn hi prow toward argiere sali morat fuchel mami xafer and other pirate haunt doricles enquire amongst them of hi mistress and of as many other a he know do rob upon the coast of spain but when he meet with none who could tell him news of her whom hi rival enjoy with such pleasure he go to constantinople and from thence unto cairo and have run along the coast of the kingdom of fez morocco tarndan and tafilet despairing of ever find her whom he have so long time and so vainly seek change hi merchandise into christian slave and return into spain disembark at ceuta while the deceived doricles do thus run along the coast of africa a servant of filander be it either out of some displeasure which he have take or out of envy of hi happiness reveal all the proceeding unto the justice of barcelona who in the night follow besiege the garden house with main force and take filander then when he least expect it the news and admiration which hi subtility and surprise cause in the city move the citizen confusedly to see him pass through the street through the midst of whom he be bear to prison and the sorrowful maid already make a woman against her will be render unto her parent the sentence be mortal the opinion common the approbation general and the process short the scaffold be ready filander dispose himself to die and make it appear that he have the courage of a knight and the soul of a christian nevertheless the viceroy and the bishop interpose their authority assemble the parent and have mollify the near dissuaded filanders death in respect of the honour which they might gain by hi life so of two evil choose the least they have more care to the reparation of their honour than to the contentment of revenge thus they change the mourning which be already provide for filander into nuptial habit and the scaffold into a bed where florinda be give him in lawful marriage but the same day that they join hand with the contentment and rejoicing of all the world doricles enter into the city and unlooked for appear at the head of two hundred men whom he have draw out of captivity upon whose casque do shine in silver broidery the arm of barcelona and their restorer hi word be i lovethe king the sight and entry of this heroic citizen be exceedingly agreeable and dear unto the barcelonians but the insupportable news of hi rival marriage with hi mistress be no sooner come unto doricles ear but all the city in arm be divide into faction and contrary party this suspend the marriage for some day during which time it be remonstrate unto doricles that he could not marry florinda without infamy he answer that what he could not have ought not to be give to filander it be in no way reasonable that this deceiver should gain by fraud what he have lose by so much travail and there be no other mean to accord him but that florinda should retire into a monastery this distress her parent who be already content with the satisfaction of their honour and the alliance of their son in law whose parent offer unto doricles a beautiful sister of filander in marriage but he unwilling thereunto demand justice against filander for hi crime offering that after he should be behead he would marry florinda a widow unto a knight this last offer be in principle agree unto by filanders and florindas parent but when doricles think that filander have be lead to prison and from thence to death he be give to understand how he be pardon and the marriage consummate if hi sorrow be great it may be know by the effect see it be now twenty year since from these pyrennean mountain which divide france from spain he hath live a an outlaw rob pillage and ruin all that he find neither kingdom be able to take any revenge he be one and twenty year old when he come from africa he be now forty one a strong man vigorous of hi person which be much fortify by hi austere and wild life and that may be believe of him which be say of hercules that without doubt he have three life for if he have have but one it have be a miracle that he have not lose it by so many wound this day about sunrise he come down to see what noise this be which the night before have sound from the sea unto the wood and he with about ten of u which follow him have find some board which the sea have cast up upon one of which be seat a young man in habit of a pilgrim like thyself pale in a trance all drench in water hi hair full of dirt and sand and to conclude evil accommodate with this tempest he command u to carry him to that place where the rest of hi men be and as well to dry him a to get him breath which he have almost lose we endeavour to unclothe him but he refuse to be see or to be touch by u it make our captain suspect that he be not a man for although he enforce himself to appear so yet hi action show the clean contrary when a prevent the desire which the captain have to be clear of hi sex this pilgrim of whom i tell thee take him aside confess that she be a woman who come in this habit from italy with her husband in which voyage they have suffer shipwreck upon this shore and in say this shame and desire to defend herself brought colour into her face and valour into her heart with one she appear perfectly fair and with the other extremely hardy nevertheless her beauty be more powerful to hurt other than her strength to defend herself hath vanquish doricles mind who with sweet and courteous word persuade her to rest this day in hi company during which time her face hath never be without tear in the meantime he command after sunset that hi supper and hi bed should be provide in one of those village but we instantly hear that some charge of money which be to be carry to genoa should come this way and have wait for them until midnight we be without both supper and lodging for this cause we send two of our companion before who be they which find you together with him who conduct u hither doricles be now with this pilgrim i can not tell thee whether he hath gain her or no nor whether the bed have make a peace between two mind so absolutely differ but certain it be that they be now lodge together the soldier easily perceive that the pilgrim hearing this story bath hi face with hi tear and with sad and violent sighings endeavour to pierce heaven they desire the cause he remain a long time silent and they still press him in the end he begin to cry out oh miserable wretch that i be i have lose my honour my glory be destroy my hope be dead by the hand and weakness of a woman oh that ever the sea pardon my life since that with so much pity it reserve thine to the end that my eye might be witness after so many labour and danger of such an offence well do the soldier know that this be the man whom the pilgrim respect and the true north star unto which she turn the needle of her affection but they endeavour to comfort him so much increase hi fury that draw forth hi sword out of hi pilgrims staff the outside whereof serve a a scabbard he run enrage out of the house unto the house where the captain lay and there give such blow upon the door and such loud cry that the captain thinking he have be assail by the justice or by the inhabitant of that place leap out of hi bed in hi shirt hi pistol in hi hand and open the door ask who be there a wretched man answer the pilgrim with an incredible fierceness and one from whom thou hast take hi honour with this vile woman which thou dost posse doricles discharge hi pistol and the pilgrim turn hi body the bullet lit in hi arm all the company run thither at the noise and the valiant catalonian dispose himself to strike quick than the lightning come out of thunder send by jove against the giant when the miserable pilgrim woman embrace him with prayer beg the pilgrims life say unto doricles that this man be he whom she do only acknowledge for her master and on the other side assure her desperate husband that she have not transgress against her honour neither in deed word nor thought because hi prayer have not vanquish her and hi threat could never i do not know if it ought to be believe of a woman the history commendeth her chastity and i do religiously believe the virtue of this sex so much esteem by me and so greatly hold in account all my life doricles would willingly that the pilgrim should have be content with hi life which he would leave him and that he should have go away without the woman but the incensed castilian defy him to a single combat begin to defame him and provoke him in such manner that he command hi soldier to hang him up at the next tree of the mountain hardly be the word out of the captain mouth when the pilgrim find himself carry out of the village by those barbarous fellow and upon hi way towards the wood where he should be branch up find himself then at the place of execution and in the presence of an inevitable death he entreat them with tear that they would let him recommend hi soul to him that be the author thereof which be permit unto him he draw out of hi bosom an image of the bless virgin which hold up with hi eye and hi hand to heaven he begin hi prayer devoutly have the match of one of their piece about hi neck near unto him who tie it to a bough of a great oak only wait for the end of hi devotion nevertheless even a he fasten the last knot the fair morning rejoice the world with new light clearly discover the amiable colour of hi face who will believe that in the space of one night so many fortune should happen to one man if it be not know that thing be write to be mark and that evil do seldom come alone see that the evil which happen in one night to one unfortunate man do surpass all the prosperity which can happen to a fortunate man in all hi life the soldier see the honest and grave countenance of this pilgrim hi youth and hi innocence and be otherwise mollify with hi prayer or have their heart secretly touch by the hand of god for he who harden pharaoh heart can mollify other they resolve to let him live not willing to be more cruel than the sea which the day before have cast him upon land from drown and think it be an infamous cruelty that he who have be spar by thing without sense should be destroy by them who ought to have reason the pilgrim give them thanks for their liberality and refer their reward unto heaven entreat them that if by chance this woman which he have leave do persevere in the firmness of her speech they should tell her that she should find him at barcelona this say he take hi way towards the city and the soldier towards the village but the feigned news of hi death which they be constrain to deliver unto doricles so much deprive the sorrowful pilgrim woman of sense whom he have already thrust out of hi chamber be vexed with her cry that she remain a long time a dead and when a she be come again unto herself she do and say so many pitiful thing that these fierce men most accustom to shed blood do now shed tear so that the captain despairing of ever be able to pacify her and thinking that the beginning of extreme grief do easily pass to a frenzy command that she should be carry upon the great highway where the miserable woman be leave drown herself in tear and murder her face with her hand she make herself look with great deformity from thence follow the way by the seaside she go to valencia the pilgrim in the meantime be at barcelona have stay two day to view the goodly strong wall of the city the third day a he be behold the viceroy palace this fisherman whose voice have so unhappily drawn him from the cabin of the other fisherman and a a deceitful hyena have call him to bring hi life into such danger know him and demand of him if he be not the thief which entertain him the other night with word until hi companion come and enter by force into the house of the village have rob them and pillage them it be true answer the pilgrim that i be he who by the sound of thy voice come out of the cabin of men of thy profession but not he who come with the robber which you speak of upon this they contest one against the other insomuch that the people run to the noise and a to be pursue with hue and cry there need no more cause but to be a stranger so all the world believing in the natural catalonians word the poor pilgrim be impetuously carry away by the people and a a robber put into prison the infamous rabble who for crime great or small be accustom to possess these place which be like so many true representation of hell put him into a dark corner bad than the bad sink of constantinople where it be impossible to recite the blow they give him and the injury they say unto him because have no metal about him but the bullet which doricles shot into him the night of hi misfortune he have not wherewith to pay hi garnish or entrance nor ability to find good mean to appease them night victorious over human care impose rest unto their labour and their thought and reduce their action to a deep silence come amongst these barbarous people yet the miserable stranger only not so much a close hi eye he felt not the grief of hi wound not the infamy of hi imprisonment all that which trouble him and all that which he fear be the pilgrim woman lose of her honour which work so with him that whilst other sleep in this confusion without that the want of bed the importunity of many noisome creature which run up and down in the prison the fear of judgement to come nor the present misfortune could wake them our pilgrim only be awake complain against heaven the sea and hi cruel fortune which have preserve hi life then when he have no feeling of death to make him suffer it now in a state so sensible at the length the sun with a countenance full of shame and a if he have be constrain shone through the thick bar of the prison windows show in the pale colour of hi beam that he fear he should be keep there when the pleasant blow of the jailer and the sweet noise which hi key make in the strong lock awake from their forgetfulness those unto whom the fear of punishment for their fault could work no remembrance but the pilgrim be not wake because he be not asleep he come out amongst the rest nevertheless to give thanks to the day for have pass over so miserable a night there begin this miserable body to move hi part go many league in a little space prayer importune some care weary other necessity call out here hunger sigh there and liberty be wish for everywhere the law call upon execution minister upon punishment and favour importune for delay those who have wherewith go out by the air other not have wherewith could not find the door the confusion of voice the unquiet of the judge the come in of some the go out of other and the noise of fetter make in this discordant instrument a fearful striving in this time a knight who for the nobleness of hi blood and the antiquity of hi imprisonment be generally respect a the master cast hi eye upon the pilgrim and consider hi deep melancholy hi habit and hi person incite by hi good countenance and aspect for there be no letter of favour which worketh great effect in all necessity call him to a little alley which answer to the door of hi chamber and ask hi name hi country and the cause of hi imprisonment the pilgrim recite unto him the success which you have hear begin hi life from the time that the sea give it him by cast him upon the shore not far from the wall of barcelona the knight wonder at it and collect from hi reason and the manner of hi speech hi understanding and hi gentleness take such affection unto him that he place him in hi chamber where have restore hi weak force with conserve which he have he make him reveal hi arm and he himself heal the wound with medicine and word which he have learn be a soldier for if herb and stone have this virtue wherefore should it be want to holy word the contented pilgrim afterwards turn hi eye round about the chamber saw write upon the wall with a coal accord to the ancient manner of prisoner certain hieroglyphic verse at the sight whereof he know that he who have write them be not ignorant over the picture of a young man which have the chief place be write this verse from virgil after that be paint a heart with wing which fly after death with the letter of aeneas send the body of hi friend to the great evander near unto that be figure prometheus or titius who be tie with strong chain to the rock of mount caucasus nourish an eagle with hi entrails the word be from ovid and say thus by a river between two infernal shore forgetfulness be paint be a young man who carry a vessel full of remembrance which he do endeavour to fling into the water with these word of lucretius the head and harp of orpheus be portray upon a gate amongst the wave of the river hebrus into which he have be cast by the bacchant they come unto lesbos the word be these there be also paint a lady lie dead with a sword through her body with these word of scaliger upon the death of polyxena in the distance which might be between the window and the flower be paint the giant argus with hi hundred eye and mercury charm him asleep with this vespasian epigram with such and other curiosity which the knight writ a aptly fit hi adventure do he adorn hi chamber and pass away hi tedious imprisonment whilst that the pilgrim be busy in behold these conceit he be call before the judge to answer the accusation against him and he relate simply the truth by the little art which he bring with him in hi speech he plainly show that there be no guilt in him hi cause be recommend unto the judge by the knight who writ hi innocence unto them he be acquit and bring back again into the knight chamber where they eat together their discourse which at the end of dinner serve for their last dish amongst other thing fell upon their misfortune because that there be nothing which more aptly and readily doth ease the mind than relation of our own misadventures the master of the lodging who could willingly have spar that name be entreat by the pilgrim to relate the cause of hi imprisonment begin to speak in this manner in a little town not far from this great city there be a gentleman name telemachus marry with a fair lady not so chaste a the roman lucretia although she carry her name the report be that this marriage be make against her wish and it be likely to be true a by the effect it be afterwards witness her melancholy increase her beauty and clothes neglect do show a languish a rose when the radical moisture of their bough decrease telemachus do force himself to divert her from this sad kind of neglect least it might seem unto some which should see her that this sadness proceed from hi default for oftentimes innocent husband be accuse for their wife evil condition he apparel her richly allow her to solace and recreate herself at sea and carry her to see the choice garden and this be not sufficient he open hi house to all good company amongst the young knight which do ordinarily frequent and converse with them there be one call mireno so much my friend that if death have not set a difference between u i could not have be persuade he be alive to discern which of u two have be myself this man cast hi eye until this time busy in the consideration of anothers beauty upon telemachus fair wife who look upon him more earnestly than upon any other have it may be incite him for although it be say that lovecan pierce a a spirit into the most close and secret place yet i do think it impossible that any man should loveif he be not at the first oblige thereunto by some little hope he conceal from me the beginning of hi thought for lovebe always bear discreetly and dumb a a child but the same sweetness of it conversation doth so quickly teach it to speak that like a prisoner at the bar he oftentimes cast himself away by hi own tongue so after he saw himself admit in lucretias eye an evident index that he be already in her soul not be able to suffer the glory of that whereof he easily endure the pain he make unto me a great discourse of hi fortune or to say truer of hi folly which could not have be hurtful unto him if he have follow my advice as well a he ask it but it be ordinary especially with those who be in loveto ask counsel then when a for nothing in the world they would forbear to do that which they have in their mind there be no history either divine or human which be within my knowledge and to the purpose that i do not lay before him exaggerate the evil which do proceed from like enterprise but mireno who have already firmly determine to follow hi purpose and thinking that i be not apt for hi design by little and little forbore to visit me quickly do he forbear to accompany me in walk we go no more by day to public conversation nor by night to private a notable error in the condition of men whose loveand friendship be keep by flattery and lose by truth i do bear mirenos absence with great impatience and he have no feeling of hi living without me because lucretia be now hi whole soul could not suffer that he should have another mireno have thus shake me off communicate hi business with a third who be so common a friend unto u both that when i want mireno or mireno want me we do seek one the other at hi house this man be not so considerate a i be contrariwise there be no kind of danger into which he would not precipitate himself to pleasure hi friend such friend be like powder on festival day which to rejoice other spendeth itself this make me disguise myself to follow them in the night and one time above the rest when i have more patience and they less consideration than the ordinary i saw how they set a ladder to a window of a tower which reveal a spacious prospect towards the sea over a garden of telemachus i stay to the end not to discover what they do but to see if i could serve in any stead in the importance of this danger and my heart do not deceive me although mireno who be within it do deceive me for after the first sleep then when a with less force he vanquisheth the care of a master of a family i hear a noise and presently i saw mireno come down the ladder and aurelio for so be he call with whom he be accompany receive him in hi arm and persuade him to fly hardly be they out of the street when a servant loose the ladder let it fall i run to the fall thereof and as well a i could gather it up step behind a corner from whence i espy telemachus in hi shirt have hi sword naked in one hand and a candle in the other and look out from the window of the tower if he could discern anything upon the ground of that which he have hear i creep softly to the gate and hearken what be say in this family where there be this alarm i understand that the disgrace of our two lover be take to be the industry of robber in this they be not deceive for those be no small thief who steal good name and rob away honour i return a little more contented to my house but slept but badly in this care the morning be come i send for mireno with whom have discourse of diver matter i ask what news of lucretia he tell me he do not speak with her for all wicked secret do for the most part conceal themselves from true friend i say then unto him that i wonder he would dissemble a thing so known telemachus her husband be come unto my house to tell me that he have hear him within hi that look out of a window of a tower he have see him go down by a ladder mireno astonish and wonder at my revelation confess unto me what have pass and how lucretia have yield to hi letter message and service have make him master of her liberty yield unto him the treasure which be so fiercely guard by telemachus hundred eye which be the reason why i place this hieroglyphic of argus and mercury with the epigram subtle lovedeceiveth jealousy he proceed to tell me that when telemachus be asleep they talk together in a garden into which he enter by a ladder make of cord which aurelio keep unto whom only he have impart this secret have find me so averse from succour him i ask what he have do with the ladder he tell me that from the leaving of that proceed telemachus advertisement i tell him that telemachus know nothing neither have the ladder serve a an occasion to discover anything unto him and let him see the service which i have do him i do begin to conjure him that he would abandon the perilous success which he ought to expect from the pursuit of this design see that telemachus at the least have notice that hi wife be not by hi side when there be noise in the lodging so that he promise me he would not go any more thither and the more to divert him from go thither he resolve to absent himself from barcelona i confirm him in this resolution because that truly there be nothing which so much eclipseth the desire of lover a an interposed distance of place between them yet it be not needful because by the time mireno dispose himself to depart telemachus have already change hi dwell from this city unto the little place where he be marry and this be a memorable observation mireno lose the repeated view of hi lucretia lose her also out of hi thought and confirm hi lovewell than ever to erisila she be that other lady whom i in the beginning of my discourse i say he have lovewho again lovehim well and with more pleasure than before because that lovewhich succeedeth after jealousy be more violent besides the amiable part which be in mireno who be of a goodly stature of great spirit and an illustrious blood of a free condition amiable both on horseback and on foot and renowned beyond all of hi age for all military exercise a for hi face behold this picture wherein i assure you the painter be no flatterer i keep it here for my comfort although it be always present in my soul a you may judge by the word write before my eye in a dream sad hector do appear because truly hi image do never abandon my sight but either sleep or wake he be represent to my eye in effect we fell into our old inwardness but in the midst of this peace the wife of telemachus have so much power over him that vanquish with her prayer he bring her again to barcelona where she be no sooner see by mireno but the ancient flame of hi loveblow away the ash into the wind reveal themselves more lively and i fear what might happen by this come back of lucretia persuade mireno to marry he himself find that it be the honorable the easy and the safe way to distance himself from these loveentreat me to find out some worthy subject who might set a bound unto hi affection i propound many who i think be of hi quality although not of hi merit but it be with him a with those who buy without pleasure and do not content themselves with any price for some be too high other too low these black those pale one lean the other too fat this be too fine another too sluttish in short seeing that he like none of those and would not marry i leave him for i saw that lucretia have more power with him than all the other together they then begin to see one another again for in these good work mediator be seldom want erisila who be passionately in lovewith mireno begin to discern in him a coldness and a carelessness in see her and that he do divert himself by other pleasure she in this suspicion which may be call a true jealousy begin to observe and follow him so that without spoil much she know if not all that pass at the least what be the subject which ravish away her mireno who will believe so extraordinary a conceit a i shall tell you truly he only who doth know how much the spirit of a woman be dispose especially if she be in loveto any kind of industry and subtility erisila never leave seek occasion that telemachus should see her until in the end telemachus do behold her and in view erisila he saw in her a brave disposition of a woman who look upon him with fair and sweet eye for when they will deceive they make their eye snare and their sweetness bait telemachus yield himself although he lovelucretia force by the eye and beauty of erisila which do so much the more provoke him by how much she desire to deceive him he begin to come to her house and she to feign a great deal of passion mireno give them leisure enough a he do not frequent her house a he be accustom finally their affection come to the point that erisila desire then she say unto him one day a if she have not know him to be marry which he dissemble also that she have see him enter into one lucretias house whereat she have conceive great jealousy telemachus smile begin to appease her say that it be without any design that he have enter into this house whereof indeed he be master and a she begin to witness a more feeling sorrow accompany with false tear he begin to remonstrate that lucretia be virtuous and well bear with a great many other commendation of her chastity and of telemachus her husband care commend himself and some be of the opinion that selfcommending be not unbeseeming when it importeth the good opinion of another man erisila then find a good occasion for her wicked design tell him that lucretias husband might be a gallant man yet nevertheless she know that lucretia do not forbear to make loveunto a knight of the city and she be afraid that she might as well lovehim a the other because whatsoever woman she be she doth easily suffer herself to be win after the first lightness telemachus who begin to wax so pale that it be easily see in hi face what interest he have in this discourse entreat her to discover who be this knight but she feign to be jealous of him whom she do endeavour to make so jealous enforceth her complaint persuade him that she be trouble with that jealousy which indeed she have raise in him in short erisila be unwilling to name who it be telemachus suddenly step to her and draw hi dagger set it to her throat make her utter the name of mireno a person whom he know well then she with this telemachus go away confess it be true that he have lovelucretia not know she have another lover but now from this time forward he would hate her and would settle all hi affection upon her in confirmation of which he give her a chain of gold and a diamond by this mean erisila think that the husband would keep hi house and that mireno by this mean bar from see lucretia would come to visit her a he be accustom but the knight whom it concern to wipe away this spot from hi honour by the blood of he who have offend him see it be now no long time to keep that which be lose feign a few day after to go to montserrat give a beginning to hi revenge and an end unto my life the two lover be not so besotted nor i such a fool that we do not think although we be ignorant of erisilas malice that this absence might be feign have have so many example in the world wherefore we send our faithful friend aurelio secretly after him but the advised telemachus who know well that he be not to deceive fool feign that he go to valencia return when he be halfway and hide himself in barcelona now mireno could not spend the night so assured with lucretia but that i keep the door although he do entreat me not to do it god knoweth how many night i pass without pleasure for my heart do always tell me that their two life do run a dangerous fortune but telemachus the third night after enter by a secret door into the garden a i speak of unto you without be hear or see by any person with only one servant with him who carry a halberd come unto the chamber where hi step be heard and out of which mireno come to meet him very evil provide of arm to defend himself not that i doubt he would not have well defend himself half asleep and naked a he be with hi sword alone which he have in hi hand if hi adversary who be accommodate with more advantageous arm have not overthrow him dead to the ground with an arquebus shoot the report of the piece make me judge that such a salutation at that time of the night be rather a condemnation than anything els wherefore endeavour to break open the door i wake the neighbour some of whom run thither with their arm and have help me to overthrow the door we enter in already have telemachus break into hi cabin where lucretia be hid and drag her from thence not far from the place where mireno lay he thrust hi sword into her so that a we arrive her breath go away with a last jesu and a he have already kill mireno methought scaligers verse which be under this picture be not unapt wa it not enough to kill and vanquish men i have not a yet see mireno and search him with mine eye all about the room i saw him lie dead thou may see in the tear which now flow from my eye what be then my grief i do not know what i do yet seek for telemachus i do excuse him for the care of defend himself and from justify so bloody an execution for have meet face to face i thrust at him with which thrust he accompany their two life which he have extinguish by this time the house be beset by those whom the justice have raise who apprehend as many a they find and me especially for have kill telemachus without cause although accord to the law of the world there be but too much cause and here they put me where thou now see me and where i have live this five year desire death a thou may see by this winged heart of mine fly after this image of dead mireno with these word out of virgil my pallas dead i bide alive by force my travel be figure in those of sisyphus and titius and represent by these word out of ovid o wretched state constraind to live in plaint eternally when death which only help can give affords no power to die the sorrow which this great city felt by the loss of mireno be express in this figure of the head and heart of orpheus with these word there wept the wood the beast and the serpent for i do not think that there be either tree or stone which be not move with this so pitiful an accident and here will i end hi story with these tear which i will offer incessantly to hi memory and these word which i have make for lucretias tomb here lieth lucretia less chaste than the roman but more fair tarquin do not force her but loveand although she die for her infidelity lovewho be the cause have the power to excuse her so the fair lucretia remain in mortal rest and her name in my imagination be not worthy of blame for have be overcome by the excellent part of her lover and by that unchangeable force which loveever useth against great and free courage the pilgrim imprisonment have not pass at so easy a rate of hi patience have not everard so be the knight call that make this discourse favour hi affair for hi innocence could not gain him hi liberty nor good opinion which he do deserve so powerful be hi only habit to work in the judge an evil conceit of hi person yet doricles captain of those robber be pardon and receive again into the city favour the pilgrim be also absolve a be hi confederate hi curiosity to hear the fisherman sing have bring him to receive a hurt in hi arm with a piece into an extreme danger of hang unto three month imprisonment which without the help of everard have be insupportable they take their leaf one of another with a thousand loving embrace and everard have far oblige him with some money he resolve to go to montserrat and i to finish this first book by a straight way between thick tree and shady do the pilgrim go towards montserrat who turn hi head at a noise which he hear behind at hi back he saw two young men with palmer stave whose fair face and blond hair show them to be either german or fleming he salute them and joyful of so good company he impose silence unto a thousand sad thought which solitariness have bring into hi memory travel together they begin to discourse of diverse matter with which they easily and with pleasure pass away the craggy and uneven way of the mountain until they come unto a fountain which bubble into a valley make a gentle harmony so that a it be invite by the sweet noise and the fresh shade they sit down upon the rush which grow by the brook side and admire the sweet complaint of the nightingale one of the german which shew a good nature embellish with learn begin to discourse of filomelas lovesay that now she would recompense with her infinite note for all the time that she have be dumb after terreus have cut out her tongue the spaniard reply that martial have utter the same conceit and the german rejoicing to find in him more capacity than in common person for it be an insupportable labour to travel with an ignorant man rise from the place where he sit and embrace him with a great deal of contentment after many other discourse let u go say he to adore the blessed virgin in this image so much renowned through all the world we can not make a more holy voyage nor i in well company than thine let u go say the spaniard by this path which seemeth to me to be much the shorter although a little steeper for the most part of the way this be say they take their way towards the abbey which they discover shortly after build upon the side of a sharp mountain and under a great rock which do seem to threaten it with ruin when they be enter with devotion and humility cast their eye upon tapestry of france germany and almost all the world they be astonish to see the wall deck with so many excellent painting history and accompany with a thousand several kind of offering which with an admirable correspondence do stir up and astonish the sens altogether there do they pour forth their prayer and their tear and after they have see and be inform of all that be considerable in the monastery the day have lose her beauty by the sun absence they retire altogether until the morning shin through the eastern gate give them knowledge of the new day approach then they resolve to visit the diver habitation of the hermit which live in these mountain and be come unto the seventh hermitage they find a young man of an agreeable countenance and a goodly presence whose long and well combed hair give a reverent majesty unto hi aspect this man stay them dinner and after their repast be entreat by the pilgrim to tell them what devotion have confine him into these solitary mountain he relate the history of hi life in this manner amongst all the thing which in the course of my life i have see and mark i might peradventure tell you some one which might better content you but think that one can not well persuade than by the example of himself i will therefore tell you a story which be draw from my youth and from the twentieth year of my age write by my misfortune and imprint in my memory see that the renewing can do me no damage and may bring you profit this short tyranny the bane of youth the illusion of the sight the prison of the soul and the darken of the sense which be call beauty and which heaven seemeth to give woman for our mischief blind so my eye at the first knowledge which they have in the world that my spirit do not live so much in myself a in her whom i lovenor find more rest out of her sight than thing do out of their centre because that a the fire always sendeth the flame thereof to it proper sphere so my heart address it desire to her beauty now a this lovebe not platonic i will not dispute whether it be honest profitable or delightful let it satisfy that it which be the cause of so much evil seem unto me the great and sovereign good in the world this subject of my misfortune be call aurelia free in her custom of that kind of life which plautus and terence describe in their fable and of whom aulus saith excellently well that a courtesan be a vessel full of hole which can contain nothing she be fair in all perfection of a quick and hardy spirit and of a reasonable good nature a woman to be short unto whom experience in the world have bring a great deal of knowledge it cost me little to possess her because that these kind of woman clean contrary unto other woman who force by the loveof a man do honestly yield unto hi merit trust to their charm and unto the gentleness of usage be passionate with men more when they be enjoy than when they be pretend i be not vex at the first with the conversation of the young men who at any hour howsoever extraordinary be never want in her house because the favour which she do me and the little which they cost me make me live much content especially see myself prefer before other of good mean and merit then myself when i go to see her they give me place and depart courteously leave me alone with her these my visitation be not agreeable unto her servant because they think that thereby this rabble of youth be scatter which bring them profit and that if aurelia should fall in lovewith me my quality be not capable to sustain her expense she must spend out of her own mean from whence would inevitably follow a necessity of live more regularly which they would by no mean hear of and of this be they not much deceive for in a small time aurelia who have ravish so many other be take herself in my loveand make captive to my will which make true one part of this fear by shorten the revenue of her house to lengthen the rein of her pleasure not that all the charge of the house fell upon her for i miserable man torment my parent and importune my friend do run to the preservation of this lovewhich almost always depend on money the life which we lead we loveone another tenderly and have in our power the liberty of enjoy may easily be judge by my youth and by aurelias who be then about twenty year old the house seem too strait for our loveand search solitary field we make the sight of open heaven witness of our folly our life be a blind imitation of the nature of beast we communicate our secret to tree which do not see a if the leaf have not be so many clear eye and a thousand amorous delight to the dumb fountain which might well have trouble the purity of their water i can not think how in so little a way a there be between my house and hers it remain 5 year space before i know that i be arrive there be certain that in 3 year space of that time the famous english drake pass the strait of magellan and compass the world about if in all this time the loyalty which she swear unto me be break or no i be not able to say nor yet forbear to believe because it seem almost a thing impossible for such woman from their custom to keep themselves to an orderly life at the end of these five year i saw myself at the end of my mean and although i be more amorous than in the beginning yet aurelia do suffer herself to be vanquish by the obligation of another who have more power than my service i say obligation because i can not believe that only lovecan bind one unto so strange a change one night aurelia have see me retire myself unto my bed she have receive feliciano into hers so be the knight call i stir with a profound jealousy rise up out of my bed and go to her house where the door be shut against me and the servant answer me from above out at a high window feign that they be go to bed to make me rather to retire unto my own house but my extreme lovewhich would not at that time have rely upon my eye and fear to be betray by my thought make me cry aloud that somebody should open the door so that my voice come unto aurelias ear and feliciano make show of a valiantlover begin to clothe himself promise to chastise my boldness with hi sword and by hi only presence to cure my folly but the cunning circe who know well whatsoever good or bad success come unto me it would rebound unto her shame hinder him with her arm and divert him with her tear although there be no great need for the brave do unwillingly arm themselves when they be once naked and to come out of a house into the street have be a manifest and mad rashness aurelia so prevail in that manner wherein other of her kind be wont to prevail and make feliciano believe that i should be her husband and that if i do perceive him she should lose me persuade him half unclothed and in the midst of january that he would go onto the high roof of the house onto which he be go i be let into the house where i find aurelia in bed make so many complaint of my liberty and of the scandal which i give the neighbour that instead of be angry it behove me to appease her where after some time spend she in complain of me and i in ask pardon for my jealousy and for the desire which i have to surprise her in that infidelity which i do distrust i possess the absent man place which be still warm serving for a proof of my ignorance and blockish morning bring again the sun and the sun the day yet neither of them be sufficient to make me see my folly so evil doth a lover discern of hi own act i rise content and although i enter last yet i go sooner away then feliciano in the meantime menander who have for the space of some year be felicianos mistress grow extremely jealous and hearing of this trick which aurelia have put upon him could not forbear speaking of it mock him with the cold night which he have endure and that he have suffer me who never have any intent to marry her to possess that place by her side which he have lose feliciano assure her that aurelia prefer hi lovebefore the obligation wherein for so many year she be bind unto me do rather abuse me than him and that whensoever she or any other would afford him the like courtesy he would willingly suffer one evil night to have so many good and for proof of what he say he give her a key whereof i be wont to be master which i be make believe be lose menander dissemble her thought but so soon a she meet me again she tell me all the circumstance and with all give me the key have which i need no other witness of the truth nor other instrument to open the door i then resolve to revenge myself of aurelia in leave her and of feliciano in serve menander from whose lovei presume he have not free himself and if he have be free yet i know he must needs be grieve that i should enjoy her whom he lovein everybodys opinion i find menander willingly dispose for our thought be alike and our injury alike and we might well serve to revenge one the other she then feign to loveme and i pay her in the like counterfeiting aurelia be advertise and grow desperate and feliciano no less enraged seek me to kill me behold how jealousy and neglect do reveal the truth which be in the centre of our heart aurelia find me sooner than feliciano do a she who therein hazard least and stay me begin in fury and in threatenings yet end in prayer and in tear but upon so fresh an injury i be rather confirm in my neglect see her yield unto my lovethan any way move with her passion finally have change my first affection into hatred always insupportable to a woman who hath be well beloved aurelia begin to pursue me and although that the city of my birth and abide doth not yield for greatness to above two or three in all spain yet could not i find any lodging wherein she do not clamour me any friend whom she do not revolt from me any secret which she do not publish nor any danger whereinto she do not endeavour to throw me so that oppress with these pursuit and see myself reduce to the contenting of her after a thousand contrary deliberation i resolve to take upon me a religious habit and to prevail by hi protection in whose hand and foot god hath imprint the mark of our reparation but oh the supreme force of a despised lovea from the holy choir of the monastery from the midst of the altar and image of the saint the tear of aurelia draw me again and then i follow her with more liberty and less shame then before leave the habit whereof i be not worthy and neglect the spiritual treasure which i do then enjoy to follow the infamous life which i have formerly lead so much power hath the capital enemy of our souls our lovebegin fresh than ever with the general scandal of those who know u the hatred of our parent and the detestation of all our friend which within a small time bring me to such term that i think sorrow would have kill me the infamy wherein we live and the fear of justice do oblige u to depart the city and selling that small remainder of good which we have leave laden with a number of evil we pass into italy from whence i go for some time to serve the catholic king in flanders and the duke of savoy in piedmont return always to naples where i have leave her the last time i put to sea with her in my company intending after the flanders war to return into spain where in a violent tempest which heaven for the quiet of our soul send u in the gulf of narbonne in the last point of life and when we be past hope of escape we vow ourselves to a religious life with such earnestness of tear that afterwards the storm ceasing and we land she enter into the monastery of the conception and i undergo this habit wherein you now see me where after some year of probation this cell be give me here tirsis the hermit of this happy abode stay hi discourse and our pilgrim judge that it be too late to pass far and it be necessary to descend into the lodging which within this holy house be give freely to stranger they go unto the monastery discourse upon the hermit relation determine the next day to go to the uttermost hermitage which under the title of st jerome crowneth the head of the mountain but the misfortune of our pilgrim which have sleep for some time begin to wake with more violence for in the house where these stranger have lodge there be miss some jewel with a maidservant of the house and the german amongst other be pursue by the justice although innocent because it be affirm by some that this servant enamoured of their beauty have run away with them all nation have their epithet which be once receive by the world can never be lose the scythian be call cruel the italian religious the french noble the dutch industrious the persian faithless the turk lascivious the parthian curious the burgundians fierce the britain hardy the egyptian valiant the lorraine gentle the spaniard arrogant and the german beautiful and this be the cause for which it be think that the maid be seduce by them have run away with them now the german be easily take but the pilgrim desperate through hi late long imprisonment which he have suffer in barcelona and out of the little justice which he a a stranger could expect see them come unto him stand upon hi defence and flourish hi palmer staff with which he be very skilful leave two of them lie upon the ground wound and virtuously free himself from the hand of the other who remain astonish at hi valour between tortosa and castellan there stretcheth forth a great hill wherewith the sea of that coast be bound along the coast of the vale of sego and of the kingdom of valencia where the moor of algiers and sal do land out of their galley when they be not perceive by the watch and hide themselves amongst the hollow place of these hill do rob not only the fisherman but all such a pas that way and sometimes when they be many of them together they do rob away whole village together in this vale they be guide by renegade and those betray again by the moor there one dark night do the pilgrim lie weary with hi journey which he have take out of the way oblige thereunto by the fear which he have of pursuit and be asleep after many long and grievous imagination of hi lost happiness which he do believe to be still in the hand of doricles the roaring of the sea the wave whereof break against the rock make a horrible noise awake him he hear near unto him the voice of some moor who have joyfully sup upon the land be talk of their robbery he who sleep upon the ground in the field at hi wake findeth himself near unto a venomous snake doth not so soon lose hi colour a doth our fearful pilgrim hear the moor so near him whose hand he do think it impossible to escape yet rely upon hi judgement in a matter wherein he think hi strength would not prevail stole from them by gentle slide upon the ground make hi hand perform the office of hi foot until he have attain the top of the hill where finding that the moor have hear him he begin to cry with a loud voice here valiant knight here this be our day behold the moor before you and a prey in your hand whom you have with such pain and diligence endeavour to overtake hardly have he courageously utter these word when a the moor like frog who at the noise of passenger leap from the bank side into the quiet water of the lake run with all the speed they could to the sea to get aboard their boat with which they easily get to their galley full of admiration be the pilgrim to see how happily hi resolution have succeed when from a tree which be near unto him he hear a voice which say ah knight help me for the mother of god sake hi valiant courage which be never astonish with any kind of danger or misfortune guide by the voice unto the tree where he have hear him saw a man tie thereunto of whom have ask hi name he be answer that he be a catalonian knight whom the moor after they have kill two of hi servant have take upon the coast road of valencia the pilgrim have unbound him and both of them depart from the sea take their way to almenara and through the valley beautify with orange tree travel towards faura already have the morning strew pearl upon flower who put their head forth of the bough do seem to salute the day when both the discourse and face of the knight do show unto the pilgrim that this be everard he who when he be prisoner at barcelona have oblige the pilgrim for hi liberty both their joy their embrace and their tear be as admirable a the success which you have hear from whence be recollect how agreeable unto heaven be the good which be do unto stranger signify by the ancient philosopher in deucalion and pyrrha who for have lodge jupiter be make restorer of the world and contrarily diomedes devour hi guest with hi horse he be in the end himself devour by them the pilgrim demand of everard how he have get hi liberty and he tell him that with the help of some friend he have break prison and escape away by the post of barcelona from whence he might well have go for italy but be unwilling to be a runaway from hi own country he be resolve to go to the court to have hi cause judge whither he be go with that intention when he fell into this ambush of the moor he then demand of him if he know doricles and be answer that he be hi kinsman the pilgrim sigh many time without tell the cause although he be much importune by everard unto whom he only say he have a young brother in hi company who have quit him to follow doricles everard who understand something of the secret suspect that this be some woman who have be steal away by the robber upon the shore of barcelona assure him that he know all the servant which doricles

fortune until the sun rise call them from their rest especially everard who carry with a strong desire of finish hi intended journey depart with grief from the company of the pilgrim whom he leave no less sorrowful in this flourishing city there he spend a few day in behold the proud building wherewith it be embellish and in the end he visit the hospital where mad folk be with more care and convenience look unto and keep than in any city in all spain there behold the several humour of these miserable people he i say who lately be likely to have lose hi own wit saw amongst those who be least mad sit down at the table at which they do altogether eat a young fool and very beautiful whose flaxen hair be long than men do ordinarily wear in spain all the blood in this pilgrim body come into hi face and go suddenly back again out of the remembrance which this mad creature bring unto him of hi mistress whom he could not well know as well because he could not comprehend in hi mind by what mean she have be reduce to this distraction and less how to this place a also through her evil usage in that place and her sickness she do differ from the idea which he have of her countenance in hi mind nevertheless a she behold him with her eye full of admiration he be confirm in hi first thought and let fall some tear he say unto her in a low voice least the keeper who have bring them to the table should hear them do ye know me to whom this woman never know to be so in that place who have see him carry unto the oak of the mountain where captain doricles have command hi soldier to hang him for whose death she have shed so many tear and sigh out so many complaint that the violence of her grief have trouble her understanding and yet also doubt of hi life though she do see him tremblingly answer that she be wont to know him already be this pilgrim by the voice by the fearfulness and by the tear assure that this mad body be the master of all her wit and fear l he might make some demonstration of hi inward grief whereunto by the sight of this so great misfortune he be oblige he demand softly of her how and by what mean she be come unto this miserable estate the grief i take answer she think upon your death as soon a the captain have command that you should be hang not without have offend me reply the pilgrim a thing which i never expect from your constancy although far great occasion have be offer the losing of my honour say she must be out of these two respect either of force or for pleasure if out of pleasure i have now no cause to bewail myself nor if it be by force mean to bring remedy and less mean have i in lose of my wit and that it be true that the very thought i have of your death be the cause of my madness let this satisfy you to see that i recover them in have you alive fair nisa answer the pilgrim be not i a miserable man in have be the cause of so much evil by my misfortune there be nothing dear pamphilus reply nisa in weep deserves this name that hath be suffer for your occasion and for so cruel a feeling a the report of your death brought to me and if i be permit to embrace you here accord unto my desire the recompense would be as great a the travel which i do bewail only in regard they be no more since that accord to their multitude they would augment the glory of my suffer it be not in vain answered pamphilus for the history name him from henceforward that my hope make me desire to live only that i might see you for i be assure that in the glory of behold you all jealousy would be wipe away that might any way allay my joy and if the eye of those who look upon u do not well see then their understanding do know you should before this have find that your desire of embrace be most agreeable to me to this say nisa whose name hitherto we have hide a also pamphilus because that travail in this habit amongst so many danger i durst not tell their country nor their name i will make my passion serve a a remedy what passion answer pamphilus every time say she when my grief deprive me of my reason they tell me that i cry aloud those word which i will now say to thee in embrace thee and then she say these word o my spouse be it possible that my eye do behold thee be it not thou who die in the mountain of barcelona by the evil hand of doricles barbarous soldier bless be the hour wherein i see the news be false in speak this nisa fell about pamphilus neck amorously embrace him whose overwhelm delight be only interrupt by the presence of the assistant when the man who have the charge of appease the mad folk fury saw this deportment in nisa he begin to give her rude word and sharp blow let him alone say pamphilus for i be hi countryman and hi wife kinsman and do not wonder that this sight of me doth cause in him this sorrow whatsoever you be answer this barbarous fellow it skills not here be neither complement nor visitation and the token of this man mad fit in come upon him be to call hi husband with such or the like word but if i pacify this hi mad fit say pamphilus to what end doth your chastisement serve and how will you appease it say the other be not this an evident token of hi madness that he call you hi spouse and take you for a woman you be ignorant of hi humour and of the trouble he give u although he do not appear to be above nineteen year of age i know all this well answered pamphilus nevertheless let me speak to him for i do assure you that myself alone can appease him and a it be a good work from anybody who hath a sickness to take away the pain for some time though it return again so in madness it be a good work to bring to pass that he who hath lose hi wit should recover them again though it be but for one hour yet neither this reason nor many other serve him to any purpose for the officer have already put manacle upon nisas hand and the master do rigorously pull her to the cage although she have no need of this remedy nor any other but the sight of pamphilus but a those who be accustom to lie be seldom believe although they say the truth so in him who be mad it be account a token of great madness to seem wise thus nisa be have away to strait imprisonment and pamphilus stand ashamed fear that everyone know what be privy only to himself behold her with abundance of tear a thousand time he be about to let go the rein of hi passion which hi understand hold in and to be mad in reason believing that if he be mad the chastisement of hi madness should be to remain with nisa which be the great good he could hope for and to begin hi design he offer against the law of this house to break the gate of the prison and see her by force but hardly have he make any demonstration thereof when the porter with the mad servitor such a have recover their wit do serve the other fell upon him and beat him cruelly fling him into the street where a the fish whereof aristotle speak which be draw out of the water frame a humane voice and die he fetch a great sigh and fell upon the ground exhaust the sun be decline low toward the west colour with gold and purple that part of the horizon when pamphilus return out of hi misery find himself in the arm of a young man who have compassion of hi grief encourage him to recover life pamphilus look steadfastly upon him with heavy sadness demand where he be the young man tell him that he be at the door of the hospital where the mad folk be keep and how be it reply pamphilus that i be not within because say the other thou appearest to be more diseased in body then in the passion of thy mind thou judgest by the countenance say pamphilus but if thou hadst see my heart thou wouldst rather judge that my evil proceed from my spirit true it be that the body feeleth also the pain of the mind what kind of evil be thine answer the young man be so near the place where evil of wounded mind be cure for if thou art not within the hospital thou desirest a it seemeth to be in see thou dost not deny thy evil and thou confessest that it proceedeth from thy mind the passion whereof be not far from fall into that infirmity which be cure in this place the evil which i have say pamphilus hath a remedy in this house and my misfortune be such that despair to cure me they have fling me out thou canst have no such evil answer the young man but there be an antidote to be find for it incurable lovesay pamphilus groan out a sigh unto which all the medicine and herb of physic be improfitable what be not lovebut to be cure answer the other and be avicenna seven remedy of no force and not true of those say pamphilus and at the tale which pliny writeth my passion worketh i only allow of hi counsel who adviseth chiefly to marry but the disposition of my fortune and the rigorous influence of my star not only do not suffer me but make it to me almost impossible and although hope sometime promiseth it to me yet i find that it be truly a plato calleth it the wake man dream lovethen say the young man be the cause of this habit which thou wearest and of thy pilgrimage it be so say pamphilus and by that thou may know the quality of my evil and the difficulty of my cure oh say the young man pitifully sigh what a grievous story dost thou renew in me a history like unto mine say pamphilus if not say the other yet at the least of loveby thy faith then say pamphilus dost thou lovei not only lovesay the other but be also more unhappy than thou thinkest for a stranger and a pilgrim and no less outrage by fortune tell me then say pamphilus in look earnestly upon him thy name and of what country thou art for in all the year of my banishment i could never find any man so miserably persecute a myself and in this i have more occasion than all men to bewail my destiny a christian say the stranger ought never to bewail the destiny nor think that good or evil fortune depend on them although many ancient philosopher have believe that there be a kind of devil and certain imaginary woman which they call parquae which give the spirit into the creature at the birth an opinion worthy rather of laughter than belief it be most certain that this name destiny be only to be attribute to the decree of god who truly seeth and knoweth all thing before they be and the ordering of them can not depend on anything but of him i know well say pamphilus that the poet have call these parquae destiny and the philosopher especially the stoic have believe that it be an order or disposition of second cause a from the planet under the influence of which we be bear which rule and determine all the inferior good and evil effect which do happen to man so say ptolemy democritus chrysippus and epicurus who also ascribe to destiny all the inclination the vice and the virtue the desire and passion even unto the action and thought which some have endeavour to prove by the authority of boetius who say that the order of destiny move the heaven and the star temper the element and tie human action to their cause by a most indissoluble knot but leave apart a matter of so long a discourse from whence be sprung the error of the priscillianists who believe that the soul and the body be necessarily subject to the star and many other error which succeed this first i desire thou shouldst know that i speak accord to custom which willeth that this name destiny and other christian idiom be take for misfortune believing that nevertheless god in hi divine providence speaks by destiny a men express the conception of their mind by word thy face say the young man promiseth no less than what i have hear come from thy mouth for thy presence and aspect be an index of thy nobleness a thy tongue be of knowledge which worketh in me a great pleasure and desire to tell thee my name my country quality and my misfortune which if thou please to hearken unto with patience i will as briefly a i can relate the city of toledo in the heart of spain strong by situation noble by antiquity famous for the preservation of the christian faith ever since the time of the goth generous both in learning and arm have a temperate heaven and a fertile earth environ with the famous river tagus which be itself also begirt with a high but pleasant hill it be the place where my now live parent be bear a also myself although my ancestor in former time come from those part of the asturias which be call santillana the ancient title of the house of mendoza there be i bring up in my more tender year but when my parent think i be capable of learn they send me to the university of salamanca with such company a be fit for a man of my place to the end that besides the latin tongue which i know already i might study the knowledge of the law here i be constrain to make a long digression because that of the history of another depend the foundation of mine my father have other child lisard hi eldest son who be in flanders with the archduke albert where he get no small reputation principally in the siege of ostend and nisa a daughter and if i be not partial one of most excellent beauty who live in that honour and good name unto which she be bind by the nobleness of her birth and the care of such parent unto these term be the young man proceed in hi discourse whereat pamphilus exceedingly trouble cover hi face with hi hand whereof the other demand a reason pamphilus say to him that hi grief which have bring him unto that estate wherein he find him be return again yet he think it be with less violence than it have formerly do all this pamphilus feign because the story which the toledan tell him be hi own proper story and this nisa whom he call hi sister be the pilgrim whose wit be lose out of the apprehension of pamphilus death so do act dissemble many time meet and sometimes do then reappear most when they be most endeavoured to be hide i will not proceed in my story say he if thou find not thyself so well that thou may hearken unto me for there be no time bad employ than that which one loseth in speak to them which give no ear to the speaker thou may proceed say pamphilus be desirous to understand the estate of hi own affair for i find my grief begin to leave me ease by thy presence and thy word i must tell thee then say the young man that there be in madrid a brave knight and a great friend of my father with whom he have great inwardness of acquaintance ever since the war of granada and i think they be together in that famous battle of lepanto from this friendship it follow that at the end of some year they treat of the marrying of my sister nisa with one of this knight son of whom i now speak and the young man name be pamphilus but while these thing be ado the father of pamphilus die and the proposition of marriage cease pamphilus who by the renown that go of my sister a also by her picture be take in her loveand grow wonderful sad and melancholy and fall from one imagination to another in the end he resolve upon this which i shall tell thee that thereby thou may see how innocent those be who without the light of faith do anciently believe in fortune and destiny which be that make hi mother believe that he would go into flanders and journey some day in the habit and equipage of a man at arm and after have send hi servant to alcal de henares and there disguise himself in other clothes he go to toledo where not be know to any person he find mean to be employ a a servant in my father house which be no hard matter to do because that hi excellent feature and countenance accompany with hi intelligence be pledge sufficient of hi fidelity and give my father not only a desire to be serve by him but also to respect him my father receive him ignorant of hi quality and of hi intent a strange imagination of a man be a knight and so well know almost of all in the country wherein he be bear that he could so hide himself at the door a it be of hi own house that nobody could know either where he be or what he do yet so it be that hi humility hi diligent service and other commendable part which he have gain such credit with my parent that i do believe he might a easily have compass hi design with hi feigned poverty a with hi true riches the chief thing whereunto he apply himself a hi whole study be to appear agreeable to nisa which be easy to be do for who can guard himself from a domestic enemy the simplicity wherewith this knight do begin hi treason and the good word which he use gain him entrance into those place whereinto hardly and with great difficulty could the ancient servant come behold with how little care a noble gentleman keep in hi house another greek horse like unto miserable troy for such of necessity must this young man heart need be full of thought and arm with malice which the hour of execution approach break forth into such flame a have fire our renown when pamphilus think that nisa be dispose to hearken to hi intention be it that hi sickness be true or feign a most likely it be he make himself sick my parent who account of this servant a of their governor and lovehim equal with their dear child there be no key about the house no account in all their expense nor any secret in their affaire wherein he be not trust cause him to be tend with all the care which be possible for loveand respect to bring the physician say that this infirmity proceed from a deep melancholy and the best remedy that be to be give be to rejoice him and principally by music in which they be not deceive for if lovedo participate of the evil spirit and that david drive away the evil spirit from saul by the sweetness of hi harp by the same mean lovemight be drive away thou sayest true say pamphilus who give great attention unto the relation of hi own story to see to what end the discourse of this young man would come who be hi mistress brother for without doubt it holdeth many condition of the evil spirit and leave apart the principal which be to torment with fire behold the sympathy which they have one with the other the devil do delight themselves in thing which be naturally melancholy inhabit in horrible place obscure and solitary and loving darkness and sadness all which quality be common with them which loveand can not attain to that which they pretend they desire solitary place and the den of desert there to entertain in silence their sad thought without anything to trouble them no not the light of heaven but let me entreat thee to proceed in thy story of this knight for i desire with passion to know the end my sister nisa say celio then for so be the young man call could play admirable well of the lute and sang so sweetly that in the like danger the dolphin would more willingly have bring her to the shore then he do arion sometimes to corinth wherefore by the consent of my parent and not against her will she go into pamphilus little chamber consider with thyself the happy glory of a man in hi case and sing a poem which he himself have compose for he have that way a dextrous facility and very natural neither do it want the excellence of art but whilst nisa sang pamphilus wept and never turn hi eye from hers so that one resemble the crocodile and the other a siren excepting that one sang to give him health and the other wept to deceive her of her honour nisa see hi extremity of sadness say unto him that her intent be not that her music should have the same effect in him a it have in other which be to make them sadder but contrarily her desire be to rejoice him there be answer he no other voice nor other harmony unless it may be the harmony of heaven can rejoice me but yours nevertheless my evil be past hope of cure bindeth me to bewail myself and not to think upon anything but upon the beauty which causeth it what evil be that say nisa past cure which proceedeth from a cause commend by thee it be an evil answered pamphilus whereof i do hinder the cure and whereof the only comfort be to know that i suffer it for the fair creature in the world the liberty wherein we live say nisa doth give me leave pamphilus to speak unto the here of a suspicious matter by the token which thou hast deliver unto me of thy evil thou hast give me knowledge of the occasion that make thee sick although i be ignorant of the cause who make the sick thou lovest without a doubt and i take it in good part that thou wouldst confess unto me that which thou wouldest not speak unto the physician assure thee that thou may better trust my lovethen their art but i conjure thee by that goodwill which thou knowest i have bear thee ever since thou hast serve my parent that thou wilt tell me whether i know her whom thou lovest and whether i can be helpful unto thee in thy curing for thy tear doe make me pity thee you may well serve to help me pitiful nisa say then the cunning lover who might well have instruct ovid see i do not hope for it from any other hand than yours and that you know the cause of my pain as well a you know yourself here pamphilus demand of celio wonder that he should tell so particularly that which pass so secretly between him and nisa how he know the same word which they have speak he be at that time far off follow hi study in salamanca to which celio answer that the same pamphilus have leave the story in write with a friend of hi from whom have have the mean since that time to get it he learn all unto the least particular and then proceed on hi discourse he continue in this manner the colour which come into nisas face when she hear pamphilus word can not be compare but unto the red rise with milky leaf although it be a poetical term and borrowed of the same author yet feign not to understand what he say she answer that if it be any of her friend she would endeavour at the least to bring it about that she should know hi evil that thereupon he might lay the foundation of hi remedy i be in that state say pamphilus that i dare not so much a sigh or breath out her name yet i can show you her portrait which be the original cause of my misfortune and for whose sake i be come from my own country into yours where i remain an humble servant of your house and do think myself most happy to be so although i be a knight and equal unto her whom you call your friend and with whom i should have be now married if my father have live until this day for only hi death bar me of this happiness and in say these word pamphilus give her her picture which have be draw by the most excellent painter of our time call philip of lianho whose pencil oftentimes durst compare with nature herself who out of mere envy unto him for that a it seem shorten hi day yet nisa through whose vein run a cold shivering affirm that she do not know the face i do not wonder say pamphilus that the ancient philosopher hath deliver hi opinion that it be a very hard matter to know oneself put this sentence know thyself on the facade of the most famous temple yet see another more natural the knowledge whereof you can not deny say this he reach her a very fair lookingglass nisa see her face within the crystal could no longer suffer hi discourse nor the knight presence but rise up in a fury say unto him in great anger a she go away thy boldness shall cost thee thy life can it be well employ answer pamphilus than for your beauty to be end she answer well say the pilgrim if she have accomplish what she say she accomplish it so ill reply celio that within a few day she lovehim good than she loveherself prove the verse of the famous poet dante to be infallibly true that loveexcuseth no one who be beloved from lovebut how come it say the pilgrim that a maid should lovewho have hearken with so much disdain in the beginning because answered celio that all maid for their first answer consult with shame and for their second consult with weakness although for my own part i think that pamphilus despairing of hi remedy help himself with charm i can not believe so answered pamphilus a man hath liberty to loveand not to lovea it seemeth good unto himself and it seem to be a terrible and cruel thing that a chaste woman should be violently constrain to lovewhether she would or no charm and witchcraft may peradventure move persuade and tempt without suffer to be in rest and with these exterior persuasion make one yield unto the prayer and tear of a lover yet for all this it can not be say that she be constrain but that of her goodwill she giveth consent to her desire suffer herself rather to be vanquish by her own proper nature than by the force of any magic art wherefore it be an evident folly in those which loveto complain that they be violently constrain will he nil he to follow their lovebecause god never suffereth that the power of free will should be take from man and if anyone say he hath be force by diabolical persuasion it may be answer he be not force in hi reason but in hi concupiscence neither be it to be believe that a knight a christian wise young and brave gentleman would help himself with such wicked mean to attain hi end it be not likely answer celio and it may be that he witness hi fidelity by other service oblige her to condescend unto hi will for nisa be not the only woman in this world subject to this weakness nevertheless behold the strange accident which happen unto them both a a beginning of their misfortune for it be rumour at madrid that pamphilus be come from flanders the news thereof come unto my father ear who desirous to make him hi son in law in favour of the ancient acquaintance and lovehe have with hi father and because that it have be formerly agree between them one day tell her that he be resolve to marry her not name unto whom and thereupon writing to madrid to pamphilus mother entreat her to send him to toledo congratulate also with her her son happy return and the prosperous success of hi affair and remember unto her the amity which he have contract with her husband hi father the sad nisa who already desperately lovepamphilus tell him that her father would marry her and the knight who be design for her husband be shortly to come from madrid unto their house but she know nothing in particular more of him but that he be a brave soldier who lately come out of flanders pamphilus ignorant that he be the person who be mean fell into great extremity at the news and after many tear and other folly he say he be resolve to be go for hi heart would never suffer him to see a new servant unto hi mistress in this house a strange and never heard of story that a man should be jealous of himself and fly from hi own presence nisa who now think it a impossible for her to be without pamphilus a the earth without water fire without matter to burn or a the celestial harmony without their first mover say unto him in weep that she would have him take her away with him and that she would follow him over the world yet upon this condition that he should swear solemnly never to lose the respect which be due unto her honour which oath be take by pamphilus without any consideration of the danger which might happen he make choice of a dark night and by a garden which answer upon the river take her from the house and by the same river go from the town carry her in hi bark until he come unto those mountain which be call sisla this be it which he writ afterwards from valencia to a friend of hi of saragossa now follow the beginning of my peregrination which have be too long in this history i will briefly relate at the dolorous letter which be write to me of this success which be discover as soon a pamphilus be go from toledo i come from salamanca to my father house which i find all in mourn for the loss of my sister my father in few word oblige me to revenge it which i swear that i would with many word as free a hi be grave and to execute my intent i go to madrid i seek pamphilus in all the house of hi friend and visit hi mother ask news of him make show how thing have pass hi innocent mother say it be two year since he go into flanders and that from the time of hi departure she never have hear from him from whence she collect he be dead i think that she know what he have do have disguise the truth and while i be in this meditation i cast my eye upon a young gentlewoman who sit sew by this reverend matron i find her in my mind so fair that her only look have power to temper my sorrow and hardly have i fully view her perfection when a i propound in myself to serve her and to steal her away think by this mean to give satisfaction to our honour and begin to my revenge to recount unto you at this time all the passage and the care which i use to speak with her and to bring her to my will would be to trouble you with a long discourse let it satisfy that i draw her from her house with the same thread wherewith pamphilus have pull nisa from ours and in a strange and foolish mind lead her into france where her beauty minister subject unto a knight to serve her and for me to kill him from whence it follow that for safety of my life i be drive to leave her nevertheless i be resolve whatsoever happen unto me to seek her because that besides i do loveher more than myself i owe so much unto her merit and virtue with which she hath faithfully accompany me through many and variable success night have spread hi black veil over the face of the earth and the house be a full of candle a the heaven of star men and creature retire themselves from their common labour when a the miserable pamphilus give over hear the tragedy of hi lovewith the last act of hi honour and to know that he do then but begin to suffer hi evil when he think he be at an end of them he admire the justice of heaven which have suffer that hi sister should so lightly have quit her mother house to run away with a man yet find in himself the example of hi own misleading of nisa and that the injury which he have do unto celio be no less than that which he have receive he do not hold it just in himself once to think of revenge but rather to persuade him that he should not nor ought to leave her which he perform with the best word and the lively reason he could devise remonstrating unto him that amongst gentleman the only condition of nobleness should bind him to seek for her which celio allow for most reasonable give him hi word to employ hi endeavour to that purpose and be lodge this night together they sup and sleep in one house the next morning pamphilus give him a letter to a french gentleman with whom he have great acquaintance that he might favour him in find out finia for so be hi sister call but celio depart not for certain day during which time there be a perfect friendship knit between those two secret enemy so that pamphilus know the offence which celio have do unto him pardon him in hi heart and celio ignorant that this be pamphilus be dispose to the pardoning of him the resolution be with great oath to enquire out one the other and to help each other in all accident a brother assign the rendezvous within six month in the city of pamplona so go celio upon hi enterprise and some few day after hi departure pamphilus sorrow increase out of the opinion that it be impossible for him to recover nisa it happen that go one night from hi lodging in a vain desire he have to see the window of the prison where hi happiness and joy be enclose he hear a knight cry out for help against some who would at advantage have kill him he suddenly step unto him and draw out hi sword out of hi palmer staff with an incredible dexterity accompany with a valiant brave courage make them loose him whom they would have kill and save their own life by a shameful though a safe flight the knight would need know who he be who have deliver him from so great danger and although pamphilus excuse himself from tell hi name yet the knight desire and courtesy prevail more than the humbleness wherewith the pilgrim do endeavour to persuade him that he have do him no service to conclude he lead him to hi house where hi good and gentle behaviour be observe the knight and hi parent bore such affection unto him that they do oblige him to become their guest there remain pamphilus some day at the end of which jacinth so be this knight call tell him the history of hi loveunto fair lucinda and the occasion for which these assassinator wold have murder him who for this only cause be come from seville unto valencia where the subject of the passion and the sorrow wherein he live do remain i do believe that lover have some sympathy one with another and that they join and communicate in such manner a you have see in this discourse see that our pilgrim never come into any house where there be not someone or other taint with this evil even though it be in craggy mountain by this overture of jacinth secret pamphilus be bind to reveal hi and after he have make him swear that he would grant him hi request he say that in recompense of hi life which he have save a he himself confess he conjure him to help him to a place in that prison where the mad folk be shut up jacinth astonish at so strange a request would need know the cause but pamphilus promise to tell him as soon a he have do him that favour and cast himself at hi foot with most earnest and unheard of word affirm the good he should doe him to put him in this place make jacinth suspect that some secret danger do enforce him into that place and willing very generously to satisfy the obligation wherein he be tie after some inconvenience and reason urge to divert him have agree with him of the mean which he should use that very night jacinth take five or six men of the hospital who enter suddenly into pamphilus chamber put him in a chair and carry him away in their arm miserable condition of this man who after so many strange success be wise if those who lovecan be so to make himself to be take and shut up willingly a a madman where all the mad folk would willingly be account wise all jacinth house admire at this novelty and all hi family complain that this stranger unto whom jacinth owe hi life be so unworthily requite by jacinth himself but she who most complain of hi cruelty and have the true feeling of it be tiberia hi sister who be both fair and discreet above all the lady in valencia who affect the gentleness and fair spirit of our unfortunate pilgrim do not see but by hi eye and do not breathe but from him jacinth tell them that pamphilus be mad and that it be necessary he should be cure before the disease increase too far the father of this knight who be very learned blame exceedingly this precipitate course say that in all infirmity there be nothing more dangerous than physic out of season and swore that he should be have out of the hospital to be cure in hi house tiberia confirm this piety say that reward due unto him they be not so poor but that they have mean sufficient to have him cure in their house with great care of hi health and less scandal to hi honour jacinth reply that he be a stranger and that nobody know him but all the household be so much against him blame him for ingratitude especially hi father and hi sister that he be constrain to tell them what he know whereat in imagine the cause all of them be astonish and wonder they think that pamphilus be a spy who go disguise under the habit of a pilgrim and that fear to be know by someone he use this subtility to save hi life for although he speak spanish nevertheless by hi fair face and exceed beauty he seem a stranger and by hi action a gentleman with this confession jacinth remain in their good opinion though the house be much troubled and tiberia be full of pitiful grief and care for pamphilus life who be in prison among the mad folk in the judgement of many the very centre of great misery imagine himself to be in most glorious happiness to this new madman the more ancient give place and pamphilus with diver feigning and counterfeitings of hi face endeavour to express hi madness which fashion of hi seem them a token of rashness they put him into the prison with iron on hi hand where to confirm them the more in their opinion of hi madness he say so many word so far from the matter that hi affliction be believe there he stay some few day before he could see hi beloved nisa suffer most insupportable discommodities difficult to be speak of and almost impossible to be believe in the meantime celio go by saragossa into france to find hi beautiful and beloved finia whom he have lose where be come he hear the news of the peace which be proclaim between the two nation which make him rest that night with more contentment out of the facility which it bring to hi design stay for the light of the morning to clear hi passage over the mountain into france whilst the sad and afflict celio enter into france by the mountain of jaca to see if he could find hi dear finia our pilgrim pamphilus have get out of the prison a a madman whose fury be over be admit to the table where other do eat where also sit hi fair nisa near unto whom he do always endeavour to sit and there and in all other convenient place he tell her hi fortune she blame him for put himself into this place although she do acknowledge how she be tie unto him for this hi great folly pamphilus a a true lover who only aim at the end of hi lovewhich be to marry her and who have swear by a thousand oath to resist the violence of hi desire until a lawful marriage would suffer him to accomplish them say unto her in comfort her that if she have suffer this misery for him and that they ought to be all one there be no reason but he should have hi part of this misery to the end that equal in all thing their marriage might be without advantage of one side or another and that hi loveunto her do prevail so far a not to let pass one day without see her notwithstanding any danger and although hi honour be thereby in hazard the servant of the house do not hinder their speaking together because that nisa be apparel like a man and have a care that her hair should not reveal her sex everybody do believe that she be a she seem to be for although that her beauty be extreme yet the world hath not any so great but it appeareth little be much neglect especially see that if art do not polish the beautifullest and fine diamond and that they be not set in gold with enamelling and other necessary ornament they show not the lustre grace nor beauty which they have be artificially cut and set in a foil by cunning workman the misery of this kind of life seem unto our two lover a nothing in regard of the former travail which they have suffer a i have hear it often say by many and i myself know by experience that if two lover may see and speak together they have no feeling of the misery which do serve them a mean to attain thereunto oh what will not those which loveresolve of what be it which doth not seem possible unto them what travail can weary them and what danger can make them fear o lovestrong a death seeing that a lover living in that which he loveand be dead in himself hath no more feeling of torment then a body deprive of a soul with what tear be these two separate at night by the cruel officer of this prison if it be cruelty to deal rigorously with mad folk with what care and languish do they attend the day that they might see one the other what discreet folly do they utter in public full of equivocation to deceive those who hear them and to divert the evil which they suffer and with what amorous discourse do they in particular warm their desire to marry how much doth he commend nisas virtue and the chaste but lovedefence which she make of her honour for pamphilus be a man have yield often unto hi passion if she have not moderate hi violence with what grace they give madly favours one unto another of the wild thing they could find upon the ground which pamphilus stuck in hi hat instead of jewel or feather which he be wont to wear but fortune envy their contentedness even in this misery would not let them live in this place at rest but arm himself anew against them even at that time when a they think by jacinth help to get out of that prison there come unto this city an italian earl of the house of aguilora call emilio who desire to have a fool with him promise a great alms unto their house if they would give him a madman who have lose hi fury might entertain him with sport those of the hospital fail not to promise him one and withal to bring him to hi lodge some of their most peaceable madman amongst whom be the pilgrim pamphilus and the fair nisa the earl joyful to see them inquire of their keeper their condition one of whom answer thus this man strong and able who you see there be sometimes a brave soldier who have serve upon many occasion like a hector desire the reward of hi valour which he have merit above all other but he find himself denied and that it be give unto the cowardliest fellow in the army fell from this imagination into so profound a melancholy that he lose hi wit he hath lose hi fury in the prison although oftentimes it return hi discourse be always of marshal an army of besiege a fort of lodge a camp or cause it to march all be sluice dykes trench platform ravelins casemates flanker palisadoes counterscarps squadron cannon musket pistols corselet pikes this weak and pale man be of another humour who have give himself too much to the study of philosophy lose hi understanding of this man the earl demand which be the primum mobile either coelum imperium or coelum crystallinum unto whom the madman answer thus after move the sphere by a local motion the divine do teach u that there be another heaven perpetually in rest from all motion create from the beginning and full of an innumerable thousand of intelligence and of happy spirit which be create together in it and with it in such sort a the mingled body be accustom to engender some thing in inferior place a fish in the water bird in the air and the vegetative creature plant and mineral in the earth this heaven for it greatness and for it inestimable light be call imperial a who should say fiery not for the natural property of fire but for the glorious clearness wherewith it shineth be the throne destine before the constitution of the world and a a royal palace ordain from the beginning for all those who be to reign before the face of god the light whereof be so lustrous and clear that the corporal eye can not behold or look upon it no more than the bird of the night can the sun all the assistant remain astonish at this discourse another one of the madman begin to cry call hi dog and lure hi hawk like the great falconer and huntsman a he have be of whom a the earl begin to laugh pamphilus say thus unto him you ought not mock at this exercise but at those who exercise it unorderly and untimely without respect either season or place for accord to xenophon and athenaeus hunting be famous amongst the persian homer say it be practise amongst the greek that thereby their young men might become hardy for a horace write the hunter often lie abroad in the cold night without remember hi wife philon the hebrew tell notable thing of hunt in hi preface unto hi warfare cicero say no less in hi book of the nature of the god and peter gregory say that the original thereof be in the beginning of the world to the end that men should be able to free themselves from the persecution of beast if hunt reply the earl who be a man of great knowledge have not pass from the honest exercise the imitation of war unto that of pleasure who would doubt of the excellence thereof but in regard of the hurt it doth in the field and the expense which it bring unto him who follow it louis the twelfth king of france justly forbid it for what els be the meaning of the fable of actaeon devour by hi dog but that overmuch hunting waste both good and life and passing by many other thing which might be gather from this verse of virgil where he say aeneas and sad dido go ahunting together in a wood join also the danger of life which can not be tell neither be it to be wonder at that this man become mad see that a dion assureth the same exercise make the emperor adrian a fool then answer the mad hunter that with more reason should he be lay in this place for a madman because he would persuade madman and reason with them who have no reason the discourse of this madman say the earl savour nothing of madness obliges me to answer for a man must fight with those who give occasion play with such a have money and answer unto everyone in the same manner he speak but if all the madman in spain be a you and that my child should remain there i should rather desire to have them ignorant than learn know say the fool that if it be possible a man should desire to be bear in france to live in italy and to die in spain to be bear for the nobleness of the french who always have have their king of their own nation and never mingle with any other to live for the liberty and felicity of italy and to die for the catholic faith which be so certain in all spain and a concern your child whatsoever happens of it suffer them not to live in ignorance for there be less danger in be mad than in be ignorant whilst this man speak another singing near to him let the earl know that music have bring him to that estate for it be say that it be a kinswoman to poetry the ancient say the madman have comprise music amongst the liberal science aristotle in hi politics budeus in hi commentary upon the greek tongue and caelius the rhodian do say that music be a mixture compound of sound sweet flat and sharp plutarch in the life of homer put one voice flat and the other sharp the flat voice proceeds from within and the sharp from the area of the mouth and from their diver temper make the harmony the object of the hearing be the sound and the reflection of the air a galen teach and the sound be make from the act of some one thing into another by the mean of the stroke which cause it two body be require to make a sound because that one can not do it the echo be an air strike into hollow place which resist the stroke of the voice return the same word which be speak so say themiserus pliny ovid and macrobius in hi saturnales the voice and the word be not one thing the word hold the ground from the tongue help by the nostril the lip and the teeth and the instrument of the voice be the throat the muscle which move and the nerve which come down from the brain who be the first inventor of music ask the earl the madman answer josephus say that it be tubal adam nephew although that other give the invention to mercury a gregory gerand and philostratus say that mercury learn it from orpheus and amphion but eusebius attribute it to dionysus then ask the earl into how many part music be divide the madman answer accord to boetius into the theoretical and the practical be it either natural artificial celestial or human the natural and celestial be that which be consider in the harmony of all the part of the world the human be that which treat of the proportion of the body and of the soul and their part for plato pythagoras and architas have think that the motion and conversion of the star can not be without music and vitruvius be of the opinion that building be not frame without music leave celestial and human there follow artificial divide into musical organ and instrument thereupon the other madman begin to put in practice that whereof he only show the theory and begin to make such a noise with confused and discording voice that it be impossible to understand them but be appease he who keep the madman make great account unto the earl of a mad astrologer who by the contemplation of such high thing be fall into this abasement hardly have the earl look upon him when he begin to tell him that the composition and figure of the world in it form be call a sphere which be solid and that pass through the middle the pole be place in the extreme or vertical point immovable one make the north on this side of the bear and from the star of that part of heaven call aquila boreal or arctic the other which be opposite by diameter be call antarctic and meridional there be he interrupt by other who would not let him proceed and after it be not possible to appease them although there be a great many more painter poet and mathematician but above all there be an alchemist a famous disciple of raymundus lullius at this time emilio have fix hi eye upon nisa and behold the sadness with which she be silent he demand of the master the humour of this mad creature who answer him that lovehave bring him to hi folly her delicate face and the occasion of her evil give him at the same time desire and compassion with such affection that agree with the master at the price of a hundred crown he make choice of her from amongst all the other to lead her into italy but hardly have pamphilus see the effect of this election when a hi fury increase truly which be before but feign he strike he bit and take on a if he have be enrage against those who take hi dear nisa away but they be a great many against him alone the earl take her from the house and shortly after from valencia and pamphilus tie up a a madman be have back again with many grievous blow bewail bitterly the loss of hi dear nisa and by how much he endeavour to make the officer believe that he be not mad by so much the more he persuade them that he be not well in hi wit because be oppress with grief he tell them plainly that he have cause himself to be bring thither only to see this young mad creature whom they have account to be a man but indeed be a woman and hi wife whom he have conceal under this habit for fear of her father from whom he have steal her away but they be so confirm in their opinion of hi madness that by those reason whereby he do think they be tie to give him hi liberty he make them more obstinate to refuse him until they might have more evident token of the tranquillity of hi mind whilst he do complain to see that it serve him to no purpose to tell the truth which of all thing in the world doth most enrage a man and that in regard of jacinth absence he could not tell unto whom to have recourse the unfortunate nisa be meanwhile come to barcelona with so much sorrow and tear that emilio already repent that he have buy her inasmuch a there be nothing more unprofitable than a sad fool the earl embark not know that she whom he lead with him have the fortune of scianus horse which cost hi master their life he endeavour to rejoice nisa cause her to sit at hi table to make her eat meat because it be tell him that she would famish herself to death where earnestly behold her face and consider her action he do suspect that she be neither mad nor a man he let this day pas over and the next day he be assure of both inasmuch a so great a sadness could not be feign and that nisas reserve speech and the modesty of her look declare openly that which upon other occasion she have hide with so much care emilio be then persuade that this mad creature be a woman or at the least have evident token thereof inquire with great care of her sadness use her a a gentlewoman and with respect due unto her sex nisa who have now neither care to disguise herself nor to live confessed she be a woman and would not be comfort by emilios word but emilio who the more he converse with her the more be engage in her lovein the end suffer himself to be vanquish in her beauty for nisa now cease to appear a a man captivate all those who behold her with her marvellous grace lovethen begin to make himself master over emilio through pity which be the cloak under which it enter into our mind a the pill under gold that the bitterness may not offend and hi passion increase so far a to desire to know her evil and to procure her remedy but neither for any effect of lovenor hope of remedy that he could give her would nisa witness any feeling of pleasure or obligation to him all which serve to sharpen emilios desire which he do make appear with great demonstration whereat nisa be grieve endeavour to divert him from her loveconjure him with tear that he would not lead her in this indecent habit the earl be courteous offer her other clothes but she assure him that she have make a vow never to wear any but pilgrim habit until she have see the patron of spain in galicia emilio nevertheless do make her one of serge and the pilgrim be new clothe appear more beautiful there be no new apparel which doth not embellish nor so poor a habit new which doth not enrich a wellproportioned body but by this time a great fog with a tempestuous wind arising in the gulf the mariner know by the sign which be wont to forerun such storm that they be likely to undergo a great hazard of drown their presage be not vain for the wind rise with such extremity and violence and the sea wrought with such huge billow that the master could no more command nor the rower obey the captain be astonish the pilot pale some cried other silent and without stir remain a men in a trance with fear and in this confusion which continue six hour the miserable galley split against the rock emilio who now no more remember hi loveand who know not that the unfortunateness of nisa bring forth this effect clean contrary unto caesar fortune which appease storm endeavour to save hi life with much travail and the heaven reserve nisas life to run great fortune cast her a formerly she have be upon the shore of

nisa dissemble that part which she have in the story blame the cruelty of her brother celio and with the contentment which she receive in see pamphilus portrait in finia her beauty she temper her grief for hi absence and her sorrow which she have that both their parent should lose their child for one cause then do she tell her that she know pamphilus and that it be not long since she saw him assure her a one verily believe that he be in spain finia demand of nisa how she know him and where it be that she have see him and nisa because she would not reveal herself tell her that she have

pamphilus himself have heretofore in hi captivity tell it to her and that she would willingly recount it to her but first she deceive finia in tell her that her name be felix and that go from toledo with a captain who embark in cartagena they have be make captive in pass to oran and afterwards have to algiers where a turk of constantinople have buy her and so follow the story of pamphilus which be also hers from the beginning a you have hear relate by celio until their departure from toledo she begin to say a follow after that pamphilus go away from toledo with nisa think that her father would marry her with another and be jealous of himself he tell me that suffer some of those discommodities which do offer themselves unto such men a travail without their lawful wife they come to seville a beautiful city if the sun shine upon any for rich greatness magnificence policy haven and staple of the indie where it may be say that twice every year there enter the substance of all spain there would pamphilus enjoy the beauty of nisa but on a sudden he lose the respect which he be accustom to bear to her chastity against the oath which he have solemnly swear and hide himself for some day out of her sight during which time he be ready to grow mad yet find her again and crave pardon with new oath to keep the first inviolably they be friend again but pamphilus be one day at the market place he be recognise by a merchant of toledo a great friend to nisa her father who go about to lay hand on him and apprehend him pamphilus be enforce to lay hand upon hi sword to defend himself from the justice it happen well for pamphilus whose courage and address in arm be incredible and accompany with an admirable force he be nevertheless constrain to depart speedily from seville and he think it discommodious for him to lead nisa with him in her woman apparel he clothe her in a suit of hi and cut off her hair of which he after make great relic he gird a sword to her side and so they go to lisbon together but they be hardly accommodate in their lodging when a a captain and a great friend to lisard nisas elder brother who be now in flanders have advertisement of their coming although nisa be sufficiently disguise yet her countenance to those who have formerly see her be sufficiently know would easily reveal that which they do so carefully endeavour to hide but their good fortune which deliver them from these danger it may be to reserve them for great would at that time wherein the captain and hi friend come to search for pamphilus that nisa be alone in the lodging of whom have enquire her name and her master she say she be a boy who serve pamphilus de luxan a knight of madrid not think that it do import to tell hi name in a strange country the captain never inform himself farther for what he seek but hi ensign inquire news of nisa whereat she be troubled and repent that she have say anything of pamphilus answer that she be go by sea with pamphilus to refresh themselves as far a belen a famous monastery and the ancient sepulchre of the king of portugal this sudden lie of nisa save pamphilus life or at the least the honour of both those lover for the soldier go presently to the haven attend there for their return and the captain account them already take and like nisa her fashion behaviour and countenance exceed well entreat her to become hi page assure her that he would use her good than any that ever have wear hi casque nisa seem to yield with great willingness if he please to accept of hi service and dissemble the care and fear which she have of pamphilus life say to the captain that have speak with her master and give him an account of such jewel and other thing a be in hi custody he would not fail to come to him with this answer the captain and the soldier be hardly go out of the door when pamphilus come out of the town to hi lodge little think hi enemy be so near to him what help do strange country bring to those unto whom misfortune be ever domestic nisa tell him the danger which threaten him and pamphilus have recourse to the remedy take a speedy resolution to leave spain nisa promise to follow him through sea and land howsoever unknown and a portuguese knight who have a company in ceuta offer to conduct him ceuta be a frontier tower of the moor in africa not far from tetouan and a it be place to confront gibraltar a the uttermost bound of europe by which place it be say the moor enter who under the leading of julian conquer spain there remain our two lover for some time in great peace although pamphilus discontent to see hi desire deny by nisa her chaste resolution have no great quietness in hi own mind he would have marry her but it be not possible to persuade nisa unto it she think it would be a great disparagement unto her honour for her to be marry in this manner and then when he seem with reason to persuade her she contradict him with tear remonstrate that she be hi and that true lovehave a respect unto an honest end whereas he who propound unto himself only delight differ little from a beast pamphilus curse these reason of nisa and sometimes out of grief would go a whole day and not speak to her until in the end overcome with her sweet patience he be constrain to send a thousand sigh a ambassador for a peace to her who have the empire over him now the noble courage of this young knight see himself amongst so many brave soldier who go every day to the war against the moor do believe that it be a dishonour to hi birth to carry a sword idle by hi side whilst other bath theirs in their enemy blood wherefore one morning from the watchtower the bell and trumpet give the alarm incite by hi own generosity and with the disdain wherewith nisa in hi opinion have disgrace him three or four day before he go forth arm at all point have a red scarf upon hi left arm a white feather upon hi helm and a mountain of snow upon hi shield from the top of which a from mount etna in sicily come a mouth of fire so go pamphilus out upon hi bay horse which have a black mane and a black tail and a white star on the forehead fill the portuguese with admiration to see with what address he manage him and how gracefully he bore hi lance but nisa her evil fortune or hi own desperate resolution who pray at hi departure that she might not see him return alive suffer the battle to be order in such manner that day that the christian have the bad and pamphilus search death break into a squadron of moor where be wound and overthrown he be take and lead prisoner unto fez the news of this accident come speedily to nisas ear for the report of evil success come sooner to the ear of lover than that of happy event what her grief be it be not necessary to express otherwise than in represent nisa far from her parent out of her own country and from any friend and which be most from the dear presence of him for whose sake she have quit all these and for whose loss she be almost out of her wit but a the great encounter of fortune do sometime bring forth the great strength and courage of the mind so nisas grief raise in her mind such valiant virtue that she boldly thrust herself into the acquaintance and friendship of a moor who with a safe conduct traffic in ceuta him she so far gained with her affability and presence that he lead her with him to fez under the habit of an arab he teach her in a few day the great part of the language of which she be not altogether ignorant before nisa thus live in fez in the habit of a moor and under the name of nephew to this barbarian who charm with her understand gentleness of spirit and graceful behaviour endeavour to persuade her to leave our religion promise to give him hi daughter with the best part of hi estate which be exceed much nisa do not refuse him nevertheless she entreat him that he would first suffer her to be instruct in the law that she might receive it with more assurance and more quietness of mind with these word and with her beauty nisa grow absolute master of this moor of hi woman wherein they abound of leila acha hi daughter of hi good hi slave and hi horse upon which a she ride up and down the town for her pleasure she be almost adore by these barbarian she call herself hassan rubin amongst them a name which ali japha have give her in memory of hi son in whose place he account of her say that she be hi portraiture amongst ali japhas slave there be one spaniard with whom nisa have many time speech she entreat him that he would inquire secretly with whom a slave of the kingdom of toledo live and whose name be pamphilus this man find out the same day and follow her when she be alone he tell her that sali murat have take him in a battle which be fight in ceuta and have him still in hi power with other slave who serve the mason about the house which he be build nisa glad of this news in the evening get on horseback clothe in a scarlet casque lay about with gold lace have a hat upon her head embroider with pearl and a great feather and a rich sword of tunis hang in a scarf by her side in this manner she go into the street where sali murat dwelt and saw in a new house which be there be build her miserable but beloved pamphilus not yet fully heal of hi wound have a poor doublet of course canvas and breech of the same without shoe upon hi foot and carry with another christian the material wherewith that house be to be build she stay not a she have think because that see him in this state the tear which she shed would have reveal her but feign to turn her horse in the street and the beam of her face properly resemble them of the sun have scatter the cloud of this water she stay look upon these slave and say unto pamphilus in the language of fez why doth murat build this fair house have another in this street so fair pamphilus answer accord to hi knowledge that they be for the keep of slave because that since hi good success in the former war he be grow proud and do presage that he should have many thou art then hi slave say she in the castilian tongue pamphilus answer that by hi misfortune he be bring to that estate and earnestly behold her face let fall to the ground that which he hold in hi hand wonder to see a moor which should so perfectly resemble hi beloved nisa for that this should be she he could not persuade himself by reason of her language her habit and the small time since that he leave her in ceuta so he remain without speak endeavour to cover hi astonishment and confusion by hi silence when a she speak to him in the arabian tongue ask of him if he be a knight pamphilus more assure that it be nisa by the resemblance of her face and distrust it be not she by her language hearing her speak the language of fez so naturally answer her i tell sali murat that i be a poor man but because you resemble so much a master which heretofore i have unto whom i never lie in my life i will not deceive you i be a castilian knight and of the kingdom of toledo and of a place whereof it be not possible but you should have hear because that the name of prince court be notorious to all nation a paris in france rome in italy constantinople in greece and madrid in spain there be i bear subject unto this misfortune wherein you see me but gentle moor i pray tell me who you be and why you ask of me my country and my quality i be say nisa nephew to the governor ali japha and son to muley nuzan hi brother by a christian slave who be bear in toledo my name be hassan rubin although that heretofore i call myself by my mother name mendoza my uncle son be dead he send for me to morocco the place of my birth from whence he bring me hither and to comfort himself call me by the name of hi son promise me to marry me unto leila acha hi daughter who be the fair in all africa and this be the reason which inciteth me to lovechristian who be well born because my mother be one especially spaniard and of her own country and it grieve me extremely that thou art belong to this governor who be repute to use hi slave hardly a it may be see by experience in thyself who be such that thy nobility doth manifestly appear notwithstanding the misery and poverty of thy clothes yet doth put thee to such vile labour wherefore as well because thou pleasest me well a for the reason which i have tell thee i will bring it to pass if thou think good of it that ali japha shall buy thee and in hi house there shall be nothing want unto thee but thy liberty a for all other thing i will use thee a myself pamphilus at these word cast himself at her foot and by force do many time kiss them thank her for the favour which she do him so be depart nisa tell ali japha the desire which she have unto a spanish slave who be evil entreat of sali murat the moor who desire to oblige him absolutely and to satisfy hi pleasure in all thing go the next morning to sali murat to treat with him about the sale of this slave which be not refuse unto him they talk of the price sali demand a thousand ducat because sayeth he he have be take in good equipage both for arm and horse and a red scarf upon hi left arm a thing which he say in the time of hi be in spain he have see in king portraiture nisa who be most interested at the bargain say to him that in spain clothes be common and the pride of soldier equal to the majesty of their prince in the end they agree upon five hundred ducat and nisa go to the chamber where pamphilus lay take him along with her he fill with tear and imagination attribute this kindness to the resemblance which be between the moor and nisa and oftentimes he resolve to believe that it be she for although the habit and tongue disguise her yet the voice and countenance reveal her she lodge him in a place differing and good than that of the slave she cause him incontinently to be clothe and go to see him the first night she bring him one of her smock entreat him to wear it under hi pamphilus cast himself at her foot and nisa turn herself away he humbly kiss the ground which she have tread upon but they have not long talk together when pamphilus grow so certain that if she be not nisa he be mad that thereby he could not sleep he could not eat nor do any other thing but show her hi thought in the violence of sigh nisa fear that in this perplexity he might lose hi wit to assure him and thereby to know the secret of hi heart utter these word one day to him pamphilus the lovewhich i bear thee constrain me to procure thy good and to solicit thy rest i tell ali japha that i stand much affect unto thee and he answer me that if i wish he would send thee into thy country that thou shouldst go upon thy word and that from thence thou shouldst upon thy honour send him that which thou owest him but i who lose my life in lose thee have entreat him to give thee my sister fatima to wife and that thereby i doubt not but i should persuade thee to alter thy religion and become a moor if thou canst bee content to do this for me i shall know thy gentleness and thou shalt enjoy the most beautiful gentlewoman in all morocco and shalt be one of the rich men of all africa because that besides what my father leave her my uncle will give her a great part of hi estate also and i will give thee mine and my wife and i will sojourn under thy government pamphilus whose intent be to make her reveal herself unto him or els to nettle nisa so far a that she should declare herself coldly answer that to obey her and to requite the duty which he owe her he would willingly become a moor as well for that reason a also that he have see fatima sometimes in the bath of whom he be grow so amorous that the little pleasure and less health which he have proceed from thence hardly have nisa heard pamphilus resolution when in an extreme fury she say unto him ah perfidious traitor and barbarous enemy without god without faith without lovewithout loyalty be this that which thou owest unto heaven to thy parent to thy country and to the unfortunate and miserable nisa who to deliver thee hath put herself into such great danger i know well my most beloved nisa answer pamphilus embrace her that this subtlety be necessary for to make thee reveal thine for thou governest thyself in such manner that before thou wouldst have otherwise plainly declare thyself to me i should have lose my wit if not my life let go my arm ungrateful wretch say nisa use no more these subtlety have discover so much perfidious weakness but wretch that i be why do i complain see that he who forsaketh god doth not injure me in forsake me but in the end after many sorrowful complaint hi satisfaction have such virtue that her anger be overcome by her lovethey remain friend with more pleasure and firmness than ever a it always happen between true lover this day pass away follow with many other during which time they enter into deliberation of the mean whereby they might recover their liberty which seem to them impossible in respect of the lovewhich ali japha bore unto nisa a also in respect of the lovewhich fatima bore unto pamphilus for she have heard that he would be a moor and that hi uncle would marry her to him favour him to nisas great grief who upon this jealousy be for the space of three month without any lovecorrespondence with him behold an unheard of story wherein be to be see what a woman who loveth can effect see she deceive the distrust of an old moor and bring all hi house to that point that all thing be govern by the only will of pamphilus who take good counsel whilst ali japha be go to taroudant where the king lay at that time work so handsomely with acha and fatima that they would go into spain with him upon the remonstrance which he make to them that hi lovebe certain and assured and theirs deceitful false and not to be believe they be not hard to be persuade because they be woman moor and lover three thing of a less resistance so one fair night have pack up all the best jewel they could find they get all four to horseback and pamphilus be clothe in the like apparel unto nisa that thereby they might pass more surely they come unto ceuta where be joyfully receive by the general he accommodate them with ship for lisbon there he let acha and fatima understand that it be necessary for them to go to rome that the chief and holy pope might receive them into the church and pardon them himself all which they do the sooner to get out of spain they be content to follow them wheresoever they would go embarked themselves all together in a ship of aragon which have bring in wheat and have a fair wind they arrive in sicily from whence because it be the year of jubilee they go all four in the habit of pilgrim to rome there acha and fatima be baptize acha be call clementina of hi holiness name and fatima be call hippolyta from her godmother the marriage be rest still to be perform accord to promise but pamphilus and nisa entertain them always with hope remonstrate unto them that it be not fit nor just that they should be marry before they come unto their father house so after they have see the great part of italy and france from thence they pass into spain where they think that nisas parent anger be by this time over for when theft in lovebe not chastise upon the act in warm blood they be always remit with time but have run a dangerous fortune in a miserable tartana into which they have embark themselves at villa franca and have be long beaten with a sore tempest they finish their shipwreck within the sight of the wall of barcelona neither be know whether nisa and the moor be alive or dead but pamphilus swimming attain unto a plank of the ship and within a day after be take up by some moor of bizerta they carry him to constantinople where i saw him a captive and where he tell me what i have relate thus nisa add to the truth to hide herself from finia know already by that which be relate in the first book how she and pamphilus be both take up half drown one by the fisher and the other by captain doricles with their several success in their peregrination in spain until they meet together amongst the madman in the hospital of valencia finia thank her much for the news which she have tell her of her brother show some grief for the death of nisa afterwards have conclude their return into spain they retire themselves together to marseille where they rest for some day finia believing always that nisa be this felix whose name she have borrow in the meantime miserable pamphilus suffer in prison with more rigorous pain than he do before because that hi fury increase with hi grief he be keep so much the more straitly by how much he be think to be the more mad in the end jacinth come to valencia and be advertise by pamphilus of hi misfortune he draw him out of the cage and have him to hi house say that hi parent have send him five hundred crown of castile to defray the charge of hi cure at home all those who remain in the hospital be sorry because until that time there be never see a madman so wise nor a wise man which do imagine so many folly there do pamphilus take again hi ancient habit and be depart from jacinth and hi sister in whom the wonderfulness of hi story raise no less lovethan pity take again the second time hi way to barcelona where he be no sooner come but he be meet and know by one of those whom he have wound in montserrat he be then the second time lay in prison in the same place where the two german hi companion have remain until that time a thing worthy of admiration in any understanding that a man should not be able to find the clue whereby he might get out of so many labyrinth from barcelona to valencia and from valencia to barcelona in journey in a small part of hi country with more variable success then aeneas do in hi voyage of italy or ulysses in that of greece pamphilus saw there hi friend with great grief and be receive by them with great joy and finia and nisa come from marseille little by little over the craggy mountains which divide france from spain come unto perpignan where i leave them to their rest attend the fourth book great be loveamongst the god and amongst men marvellous say phaedrus in plato hesiod say that the two first thing which be see after the chaos be loveand the earth parmenides say that it be engender before the god prefer it in knowledge to the father of the mus and in war before the god of battle make this argument that that which detain be great than that which be detain and that he be truly strong who vanquish the strong he call it the light of the understanding and assure that he live only in darkness who be not lighten with it fire and among other attribute he call it the god of peace the father of desire and the appetite of good in the presence of which the soul desire to be eternally from whence it follow that lovebe a desire of immortality which reconcile affection give goodwill take away hatred of the nature of this lovebe that of our pilgrim at the least nisas who be with finia depart from perpignan come with her into barcelona about that time when the sun have pass the middle of the day descend towards the west indie but fortune not yet weary with trouble and cross them show her that the first travail be only to be fear in regard of those which be necessarily to follow for a she enter with finia into the city a confused throng of people constrain them to stand in the middle of the street nisa be desirous to know upon what occasion such a world of people be assemble and see an old man who relate it unto other with pity she entreat him out of courtesy to tell her it be pilgrims my friend say the old man because there be a knight a castilian go to have hi head cut off for kill an officer of justice who would have apprehend him upon suspicion of theft which he have not do near unto montserrat whether he be go in pilgrimage a you peradventure may do but besides the greatness of hi crime which be no less then rebellion he be find to have in the hollow of hi staff a sword long then be permit to be wear by the ordinance of this kingdom i be much grieve at it answer nisa for many reason and principally because he be a castilian for a you may perceive by my tongue this pilgrim and i be both castilian it would more grieve you say the old man if you saw hi face and hi proportion accompany with such youth that he doth not seem to be two and twenty year complete can you tell this knight name say finia one of my son say the old man have be hi proctor and he tell me that he be call pamphilus de luxan bear at madrid which be a city sufficiently know throughout all the world with a pale and deadly countenance do the two pilgrim behold one another and burst into tear a from two fountain they embrace and fell down together the good old man wonder to see them thus suddenly oppress know that this knight name have pierce to their soul and encourage them as much a possibly he could he retire them to the door of the next house the good to avoid the throng of people which stay at the rareness of the accident nisa and finia have some time bewail the miserable pamphilus tell the old man that he be their kinsman then come a man enter into the street break through the press of the people with hi horse which move nisa to entreat the old man to enquire what he be and upon what occasion he make such haste through the company who be inform and come again demand a reward for the good news which he bring hath pamphilus hi pardon say finia he whom you saw pas by answer the old man be a knight of valencia call jacinth centellas who come the other day into this town upon some occasion know pamphilus and withal understanding he be condemn to die tell the viceroy that this criminal person be a madman and but newly get out of the hospital of valencia a he offer to verify whereupon the viceroy and the judge willing to save this young man suspend the execution of hi judgement and give commission to this knight to bring proof of hi affection so much the rather believe hi word by how much pamphilus confess hi crime and desire to die with an extreme grief but the time expire which be give to jacinth for the verifying of pamphilus madness he be go towards the place of hi execution and by the way be meet by jacinth a you have see who hath bring with him sufficient proof and an express command from the viceroy that he shall be take back again to valencia this news revive nisa and finia who have rest themselves there all that day go the next day to see him in the prison at the entrance whereof they find that for a madman he be take out and set upon a mule to be carry to valencia and even upon the instant that pamphilus lift up hi eye behold hi dear nisa and that she advance herself to speak to him come one of the servant and apprehend nisa and hi companion seize upon finia put them both in prison although pamphilus cry out that she be hi brother for be account for a madman he be not hearken to but contrariwise because he passionately cast himself from hi mule upon the ground he be with much cruelty tie upon hi mule back and with shrewd blow set forward in hi way their opinion of hi madness be the more confirmed i can not forbear wonder every time i think of this man misfortunes he come first to barcelona to suffer at valencia all those misery which you have formerly hear and now it seem he return that way again anew to begin the same pain the cause of finias and nisas apprehension be that nisa in regard of hi apparel and of hi short hair be think to be a man and be always in finias company the justice take hold of them out of a strong suspicion that they do live lewdly and incontinently together a thing which be often cover under the cloak of pilgrimage which make it more odious and frequent in that country whatsoever might happen of it nisa would not reveal herself notwithstanding any fear of chastisement but defend her cause a a man deny that ever she have so much a spoken otherwise than with great honesty and modesty to finia who account nisa for a man and believe certainly that she be the same felix whom she feign to be

or four time at jacinth house loveto work the great confusion have augment hi sister tiberias desire who a you have hear cast her eye upon pamphilus beauty he overcome with the good turn and pitiful

in prison he may confess hi own crime and whether he kill him for to rob him or whether some enemy of my brother godfreys do not hire him to murder him the traitor answer to tirsus and to the other who do accompany him that blood yet warm of hi friend would not suffer him to delay hi revenge so long yet all their opinion prevail against hi the innocent pamphilus be bind hand and foot on a horse and dead godfrey laid on another it be a just judgment say pamphilus by the way for my leaving of nisa wound and jacinth almost dead do you not hear say tirsus without doubt this nisa be the woman for whose sake he hath commit this murder and jacinth some friend who lead my brother to the place all of them believe what tirsus say and the traitor tansiles interpret pamphilus despair in such sort

me it i be a knight and of a family from which ungrateful man nor traitor ever spring thou shalt do a heroic deed worthy of an illustrious lady and though i should never merit it yet heaven will not fail to acknowledge it flerida have not need of so many reason who be virtuous and so well disposed to free him that she would hazard a thousand live to give it to him and a aptly it serve those which be go to accompany her brother body to the grave not be able to return speedily as well in regard of the distance of the place a in respect of the pomp of the funeral which last nine day give her opportune mean to open the plank on the top of the prison thereby let him down some vittles all her other sister her mother and the servant only enter to torment him they see him live not know wherewith he do sustain himself anger indignation and cruelty increase so far in them that they resolve to kill him before tirsus return from the obsequies of hi brother but flerida the same night give him such strong file that the fetter staple and lock be cut asunder and he be fasten to a cord she draw him up by that hole which she have make by remove the plank all the household be in their dead sleep she open the gate afterwards with honest embrace shed some tear and with many jewel which she do constrain him to take she be depart from him when he cast himself at her foot with the humblest word he could speak promise to repay her this good turn with an immortal remembrance and if that ever she have occasion to come into castile she should enquire for a knight of madrid call pamphilus of luxan that she might be assure she should not return without due thanks and acknowledgement for so perfect an obligation pamphilus know that to proceed far in the quest of nisa be to resist the will of heaven which have oppose him in it with so many rigorous success go to saragossa resolve from thence to travel into castile if thou didst not possess o nisa say he to himself a he go along all my thought and if thou didst not hold a much place in my body a my soul do which be all in every part who would doubt but flerida should be now mistress of my will o how powerful be good turn in apt occasion see that the firmness of lovewhich could not be move with such painful travail such fearful shipwreck and with such cruel captivity and imprisonment with one good turn alone in an opportune time be shake if not master at least the roof if not the wall and although the foundation be firm yet the window and other ornament do shake let not those which shall hear this be displease with him for this be not so much a change from the loveof nisa a a feeling of fleridas goodwill and a there be nobody so solid which the sun sometime doth not pierce so there be no loveso firm but that the first motion thereof may shake pamphilus so by long travail come to saragossa and would not enter into it before it be dark night for fear he might be follow or meet by someone whom he know and very early in the morning depart from thence and by unused path from pasture to pasture and from mountain to mountain he endeavour to shun the great highway fear that fleridas brother might make pursuit after him in the end weary with the sharpness of the mountain and the austerity of the life which he be constrain to lead he resolve one night to lie in some place where he might be well accommodate than in these desert and enter into a city which divide the two kingdom he enquire for a lodging but nobody be willing to entertain him see him so evilly apparel hi foot bloody hi face tan hi hair knot and shag he go to the hospital the last refuge of misery pamphilus find the gate open at that time but without light and ask the cause he be tell that in regard of a strange noise which every night be there heard which have happen ever since the death of a stranger who come thither to lodge nobody have dwell there yet he might a they say enter in if he would for he should find there a man of holy life in a little chapel who endure for the honour of god all those illusion and who would show him a place where he might lie without danger pamphilus then enter into a dark obscure place and after some few step saw a great way off a dim light of a lamp to which place he address himself and call the holy man what wouldst thou have thou wicked spirit answer the holy man thou dost mistake me say pamphilus i be a pilgrim who endeavour to seek a lodging for this night then he open the door where pamphilus saw a man of a middle stature and age with a long beard and hair a gown of coarse cloth down to hi ankle the chapel be little with an old altar the base whereof do serve him for hi bed he have a stone for hi pillow hi staff for hi companion and a death head for hi lookingglass how durst thou come into this place say he to the pilgrim do no man advertise thee of the disquiet lodge which be here i have be tell it answer the pilgrim but i have suffer so much labour in my travel so much cruelty in imprisonment so many heavy misfortune and cold entertainment that no disquiet can be new to me the poor man then light a candle at the lamp which burn before the altar and without say anything command the pilgrim to follow him he go through a garden which lay wild a a forest or wilderness where have show him a part of the house amongst some cypress tree he unlock the door of a chamber and say to him see thou art young and accustomed to travail enter here make the sign of the cross and be not dismay nor astonish but sleep pamphilus take the candle and set it on a stone which lay there bid hi host good night and shut the door there be a bed in the chamber good enough to rest on especially for a man who hath lie so many night on the ground this invite him to unclothe himself and take one of the shirt which flerida at hi departure have give him he put it on and get into the bed hardly have he revolve in hi imagination the confusion of hi life a thing which often the body be at rest be represent to the mind when a sleep which be truly call the image and brother of death possess hi sens with that force which it be accustom to use on weary pilgrim all that part which the sun abandon when it go down to the indie be in a deep silence when the noise of some horse awake pamphilus he think he be stir as many time happen to traveller and that hi bed do move a if a ship or a horse be to carry him nevertheless remember that he be in the hospital and the cause for which it be uninhabitable he open hi eye he saw horseman enter by two and two into the chamber who light torch which they have in their hand at the candle which he have leave burning by him they cast them against the ceiling of the chamber where they stick fast with their bottom upward and their top downwards which drop down burn flame on hi bed and on hi clothes he cover himself as well a possibly he could leave a little hole to look out that he might see whether hi bed do burn or no when as instantly he saw the flame go out and that on a table which be in the corner of the chamber four of them be play at primero they pass discard and set up money a if they have truly play so long till at length they debate upon a difference they fell into quarrel in the chamber which make such a noise with clashing of sword that the miserable pamphilus call on for help our lady of guadalupe which be only left of all the shrine in spain unvisited although it be in hi own country of toledo because holy place near to one be many time leave unvisited out of a hope which be have that they might be visit at any time nevertheless the clattering of the sword and all other noise for the space of half an hour cease and he be all of a sweat out of the very fear he have yet no sooner be he well satisfy to see himself in their absence at some rest not think that they would come again when instantly he felt that the bed and the clothes be pull away from him by the outermost corner and he saw at the same time a man come in with a torch in hi hand light follow by two other the one with a great brazen basin and the other sharpen a little knife then begin he to tremble and all hi hair stand on end he would have speak but he be not able when they be near him he who hold the torch put it out and pamphilus think that they would kill him and that the basin be to receive hi blood put hi hand forth against the knife and felt that they lay hold of him he give a great cry and the torch instantly kindle again and he saw himself between two great mastiff dog who hold him fast in their teeth jesus cry out pamphilus at which name all these fantastic illusion vanish away leave him so weary and so affrighted with their company that he would not stay there any long but go out into the garden by which he be enter he go to the chamber of the good hermit who see him so pale weak and naked open him the door and say to him have your host here give you an evil night lodge so ill say pamphilus that i have not rest all night and yet i have leave them my clothes to pay for it the good man receive him as well a he could tell him how many other with like success have be so used and many other discourse wherewith he pass away the night until morning those who do not know the nature quality and condition of spirit will account this history a fable wherefore i do not think it unfit to advertise them that there be some fall from the low choir of angel who despite the essential pain which be the eternal privation from the sight of god suffer less pain than the other a not have so much sin and those be of such nature that they can not much hurt men but do take pleasure to displease them with frightings noise rumour subtlety and such like other thing which they do in the night in house which thereby they make altogether uninhabitable not be able otherwise to hurt but by these foolish and ridiculous effect limit and bind by the almighty power of god these the italian call fairies the spaniard elf and the french hobgoblin of whose mockery and sport william totan speak in hi book war of the devil call them devil of the least noble hierarchy cassian write that in norway they possess highway play with passenger and do hire themselves out for wage a servant jerome manchy report of a spirit which be in lovewith a young man serve him solicit him in diver form and steal money buy him many thing wherein he delight michel pselho make six kind of these spirit fiery airy earthy watery subterranean and fire fly spirit in all which author one may see their property their illusion and their remedy the light of day which be the amiable and illustrious daughter of heaven and the only guide of mortal do sufficiently assure pamphilus that now he need not any more to fear the evil infestation of the spirit then wake this good man they both rise and go together to the chamber where pamphilus lay but enter in to see the stir that be make the last night they find the bed pamphilus clothes and all other thing in the same place where they have lay without any appearance that they have be stir whereat pamphilus be ashamed with haste make himself ready without speak a word and thinking that this good hermit would account him for a great liar and a man of weak courage depart from him and thence take hi way towards guadalupe without once dare to turn hi head towards the city vow to himself never to come into it again upon any occasion whatsoever should happen if he be not assure to find hi nisa there there be two hill in the confines of the mountain of morena which a two strong wall environ the town and monastery of guadalupe with so many fountain which run from the rock into the bottom of the valley so much fruit and so much grain of all sort that it seem nature know that which should happen have destine this place from the beginning of the world to build this palace to the princess of heaven the pilgrim be come thither and have adore the virgin visit the temple and pay hi vow a he go back again down the stair at that time of the year when the sun be equally distant between the two pole he meet a passenger go towards the temple who earnestly behold him ask him if he have not know either there or in any other place a pilgrim of madrid call pamphilus who lately be in aragon pamphilus trouble with this demand and fearing that he be seek after with some warrant from the justice for godfreys death turn back and flee towards the temple but the aragonese by some token which be give him and by hi sudden flight presuming that it be he follow him and courteously call him say stay knight i be not come to apprehend you neither doth the privilege of this place permit any man to be arrest prisoner here it be only a letter from a young lady call

continue hi lovefriendship by letter not only with her but with her brother also until that she be marry with a knight of andalucia be carry into the indie ten time have the sun circle heaven in the time of the year when a astrea doth equal the balance of the equinoctial when pamphilus journey night and day through desert and unknown way find himself one morning when the day begin to smile on him at the side of craggy mountain oppress both with weariness and hunger and much more with the remembrance of nisa where sit at the foot of an oak behold the solitariness of the field and the murmuring of the little brook which fell precipitately from the mountain he hear a flute play upon to the sound whereof turn hi eye he saw a man sit between two rock amidst a flock of sheep which seem to leave their feeding to hearken to hi music but pamphilus have other discourse in hi head go to him and wish health to him which he could not obtain for himself and courteously again salute by the shepherd who have nothing that savour of rustic but hi apparel make him know in a few reason hi understanding and the other quickly discern in the pilgrim that he have more need of meat than discourse wherefore get fire out of two laurel stick which for that purpose he carry with him they poorly fed of that which fabio for so be this shepherd call have willingly dress the ground serve them for a table the grass for napkin and bubble brook for their drink and music they pass away the best part of the day in tell their adventure and when it grow night they retire themselves into a little village whether fabio lead pamphilus to keep hi master oxen who be a farmer of a grange which nisas father have in the mountain pamphilus be glad of this condition hop that by this mean he might with time have news of hi mistress by the way pamphilus entreat fabio to relate the cause of hi retire into this place who although that this request bring to hi mind a great deal of grief and passion yet after some sigh he shortly tell him that he be bear in biscay and descend of most noble parent who be careful to fit him in hi youth with quality answerable to hi birth wherein he profit so well that he neither raise discontentment in hi parent nor shame to hi tutor but after grow more ripe in year and incite with the courageous heat of youth in those time when the english with their warlike ship ravage along our coast as well of spain a the island and oftentimes with their desperate resolution make themselves master of our indian gold i put myself to sea in one of the king armada as well with an intent to gain honour by my valour a experience in those service thereby to be the abler to serve my country wherein i be so fortunate because i will not say too much that i get command myself and by take and execute two or three of those pirate be in a fair way both of grace with the king and renown in the world when my eye be the instrument whereby the most excellent and admirable beauty of albiana captivate my heart so powerfully that all other course set apart i be enforce to give myself wholly to her service wherein after some small time i have so happy a progression that she do confess she be oblige by my perseverance and by the opinion which the world held of me to esteem of me and of my service thus happily in her favour i spend some time until it fortuned some english slave which i have endeavour to make an escape but by my soldier and mariner prevent i inflict a cruel punishment on them bound thereunto by that common policy which exact from master a severe hand over their mutinous slave especially i use it towards one who more eminent then the rest as well in regard of hi person a that he be a chief author of their attempt which albiana with most earnest prayer to me seek to divert be it out of a pitiful compassion ordinary in most woman or that she take any special liking to him but i have more care at that time to execute my rage then mindful of her importunity which i do not think would have turn to that consequence for example sake which a it be powerful so be it most necessary especially amongst men of our profession who serve ourselves with multitude of them persevere in have him soundly punish whereat she discontent though with little show thereof underhand wrought such mean by her friend at court before i imagine any such thing that the slave be by messenger from the duke of lerma and by warrant under the king hand fetch from me and the next day she do let me know that any denial to a woman effect her hatred for she send me a letter wherein she say i be a cruel monster and that she be so far from loveand esteem me that she would ever hate my barbarous nature and she wonder that any valour could be lodge where cruelty have such a habitation to conclude she tell me that i should never come in her sight nor be where she might hear of my name how grievous this be to me gentle sir may easily be guess if you know the extremity of my lovewhich be so much that i presently without the knowledge of any of my friend take such order a i could with my command and retire myself into these desert place where i be resolve under this disguised habit to end my day see that albiana will have it so who whether her complaint be just or no or whether they but serve to colour her inconstancy shall be always loveand truly obey by me to whom only this comfort be leave that though life hath leave me death will take me before fabio have finish this short discourse they have discover the village where alfesibus do keep nisas father cattle in the best house of the village which for a country house be a fair one alfesibus receive pamphilus and inform by fabio of hi intent he agree with him for wage and after an evil supper and a bad lodging he pass the night miserably and when morning appear pamphilus go after hi ox to the solitary field where he live some time free from the confused noise of the city with a good leisure to meditate on hi adventure in the meantime nisa heal of her wound and know that she have receive them from her own brother out of jealousy which he have conceive against her for finia and entreat her good host that he would have pity on her blood by both their mean hi pardon and liberty be obtain the one soliciting and the other forbear the prosecution one of the wound which nisa have receive be in her left side and a in the dressing it could not be avoid but that she be know to be a woman although she have conjure her host to keep it secret from hi family yet it be impossible because that hi son thesander unhappily one day be at her dressing and transport so into hi mind the wound which she have in her body that within a few day he fell sick by force of this continual thought not be able to receive into hi imagination any thought but the desire of this beauty for all the heaven of lovemove between these two pole imagination and desire and then hi body be a full of imaginary and fantastic figure a the astrologer globe thesander do all that he could to divert himself from this thought and a evil be heal by their contrary he propose to hi eye other object and other care to hi imagination but a art be make out of many experience which be want to thesander he rather find the evil than the remedy for it be impossible that young men should know much because that to be wise require experience and that be get with time nisa be much grieve at thesanders passion although he have never speak to her about it but a he which be amorous so often speak a he look on that which he loveshe easily read in hi look the depth of hi thought and willing to disabuse him so that not be understand by other she might let him understand the vanity of hi loveone night after she be heal be entreat by all the company she sing these verse follow but they rather increase the fire which be too much kindle in thesanders soul who take the lute from nisa answer her with these verse which he have conceive in hi mind the night before very aptly might nisa at that time have revenge the motion which pamphilus have to agree to fleridas will if lovehave be a spirit a some have believe which might have tell them to her but it be not just that so rare a faith should be spot with any infamy thesanders lovein the meantime spring from this first spark and increase by nisas resistance like a fire which a little water make more violent or like palm tree grow most when a weight be lay on them nisa wax strong and walk abroad when desperate thesander reveal himself to a physician who encourage him either to manifest hi evil or els a the best remedy against hi loveto work from hi imagination this deep melancholy and to divert it by some honest exercise and that the courage of the practiser be the first matter on which the heaven imprint the form of their succour for as much a their favour be not obtain by womanish prayer and vow but by the vigorous action of men agree to which the greek adage say that the god do sell their blessing unto men in exchange of their labour thesander be animate by these counsel but find that division be weak remedy against the splendour of nisas beauty fell into a relapse and grow so weak that he be constrain to reveal the cause of hi sickness the pitiful father who be already inform of nisas quality conjure her with tear to be mistress of hi wealth and marry hi son of whose sickness there be no other remedy nisa admiring at the several way whereby fortune seek to separate her from pamphilus reveal then to the good old man the whole history of her life and lay before him all the impossibility which do excuse her from satisfy so many courtesy the chief whereof be in hi willingness to admit her to the high degree of honour and affection that be possible for him to do she be a stranger and in such an indecent habit for a woman fit to be hi son wife by this mean she satisfy the father but poor thesander be so desperate that fall into great extremity he be at the last point of hi life like unto tree whose bough do not lose their greenness until that their humour which doth quicken them do absolutely fail because that hope be the radical moisture which doth keep u alive and be to u a oil to our fire nisa see that thesander be for her sake upon the point of lose hi life and she herself have not now live but out of hi father pity be exceedingly perplexed that she could not satisfy so just an obligation and not be able to rest in these confuse thought the representation of pamphilus labour do always appear in her mind who she think to be prisoner still at valencia thesanders evil increase nisa defer the remedy and the father accuse this poor amorous man in my opinion innocent because that in thing natural we do neither merit nor demerit in brief all the whole family entreat nisa that she would have pity of thesanders young year and that at the least she would assuage hi passion with one amorous word amongst all the variable fortune a well by land a sea which our pilgrim have suffer there be none so difficult for her a this nevertheless she resolve to entertain thesander until he have recover some strength that thereby he might the good be able to bear the subtlety which she intend and in this she do not deceive herself for our spirit have some resemblance with the nature of young horse which be easy manage with gentle bit than with hard the sweet word the feigned hope and embrace of nisa within few day restore thesanders weaken spirit during which time celio be deliver out of prison with an exceed desire to see her as well because he have hear news of her health a because he imagine that if finia be not in her company yet at the least he might hear some news of her nevertheless the sorrowful nisa believing that celio desire to kill her not know what pamphilus have tell him of her disguise herself in the habit of a pilgrim so soon a she hear of hi freedom flee secretly from barcelona in the meantime lisard the eldest brother to celio and nisa who a you hear be a soldier in flanders disembark in the same town of barcelona far from think that person so near him be there have meet with finia on the way on the first day of her travel although almost in the last of the tragical comedy of her fortune sorry to see so fair a pilgrim go afoot understand which way she be bound offer to accompany her into castile finia willing to be go from celio whom she think never to be able to appease and not know that this be hi brother accept hi offer and go with him to toledo where be receive of hi parent with all kind of joy hi desire be that finia might also be well entertain and kindly use tell them in what manner he have find her hi parent receive her with a great deal of honour and embrace yet not without some suspicion that she be some spoil of the flanders war lisard then ask for hi brother celio and for hi sister nisa they tell him the cause of their absence finia thereby know that the house wherein she be come be her husbands father and that he who have bring her thither be hi brother whereat not sufficiently wonder she then think that fortune begin to look on her misfortune with a more clear countenance the day follow lisard resolve to seek for hi sister nisa and to kill pamphilus tell hi parent that he have some pretension at the court on which he build the necessity of a new voyage show them some attestation in writing of that which he have do in flanders for which he hop of good recompense hi father perspicuously know hi mind through hi reason wherewith he endeavour to colour hi journey and fear to lose him with the other propound a thousand objection tell him that he should now rest after hi voyage and from the travail of war content himself with the honour which he have get because that in this age the reward do fly from the merit lisard thus persuade by hi father remain in the house although it grieve him that after he have buy so much renown with the loss of hi blood so far from hi own country he should now lie still and rust with infamy finally be discontent that he be behold a he think with this mark he go into the country to shun the first encounter of the people sight into the same village where amongst the other servant of hi father farmer pamphilus live who be never before know of lisard and a one day he behold him more curiously then he do all the other for hardly could the baseness and indignity of hi habit disguise hi person and beauty he call him to him and inquire of the cause why he live in this base office the excuse which he make do not seem current indeed be feign by pamphilus who already know that lisard be nisas eldest brother wherefore lisard say to him that he should do good if leave this rustic life he would abide in hi service and take the charge of two horse which he have for which he would give him wage and convenient clothes pamphilus refuse this offer not that he be not willing to return into the happy house in which he have first know nisa but fear that be know in her absence he should run a dangerous fortune of hi life nevertheless be weary of the austere life which he lead amongst these mountain for there be nothing more true a the philosopher say than that those which be solitary be either god or devil he resolve in the end to accept this condition wish rather that he might die by nisas parent hand then live any longer in these solitary desert now you see how forward we be in bring back our pilgrim from hi long travel see that from be a courtier he become a soldier from a soldier a captive from a captive a pilgrim from a pilgrim a prisoner from a prisoner a madman from a madman a herdsman from a herdsman a miserable lackey in the same house where all hi misfortune begin to the end that you see this circle of fortune from one pole to another without one moment of rest or any of good in the beginning middle or end of hi adventure you may learn to know how travelling abroad bring honour profit and many time the contrary all consist in the disposition of heaven whose influence guide the passage of our life a it please them because that although the empire of freewill be above yet few person be find who resist their motion it be therefore a weakness unworthy of a gentle heart not to dare hazardously to enterprise anything see it be evident that if those who have effect great thing have not begin them they have never achieve them a also hazardous enterprise belong only to brave courage although heaven disposes of the success above all thing the election import much a propertius say all thing be not equal unto all seneca tell of an old man who be ask how he could live to those year in follow the court answer that it be in do good turn and not except against injury but this patience doth not seem honourable to me nor that it be any virtue to serve to live and if posterity doth render unto everybody hi honour a tacitus say what renown can he leave behind him who die a it be in the cradle and from hi swaddle clout to hi hearse hath hardly shift a shirt like the plant which hath the form of a living lamb the stock whereof grow out of the ground to the stomach and not be able to eat more grass than that which grow round about it die for want of nourishment glorious be darius when be come to the river tearus which take hi begin from two fountain whereof the one be hot and the other cold he cause the famous inscription whereof herodotus speak to be make to this place against the scythian come the most famous of all men darius the son of hystaspes who hath ever obtain anything without run for it who hath ever run for it if he have not see it and what rest can he know who hath never prove any storm or adversity by sea or land for there be no day so sweet and comfortable a those which we spend in the arm of our friend after long travel and great danger nor any night so sweet a those which be spend about the fire with an attentive family unto the discourse of one former danger and adventure a ulysses within zacinth to hi dear penelope and hi son telemachus so after many diver adventure pamphilus come to the happy day of hi rest and though he be not at the siege of troy nor at the conquest of the new world with cortes yet it be no small valour in him to defend himself from so many different and perilous assault of fortune and in the end to have merit by so many labour the rest which shortly he shall enjoy in hi own country whilst these thing thus pass in the mountain of toledo thesander be be recover by nisas loveembrace and she dispose to leave him as well because hi life be assure a because that she desire to assure hers and deliver herself from the care wherewith she be search after by her brother celio one night when sleep master her lover sens and hold a silence over the whole family she go out of the city and take the way towards lerida but night have hardly all hide her black head crown both with sleep and fear when the deceive thesander wake out of the most sorrowful dream that could possess hi fantasy represent to hi imagination the absence of fugitive nisa together with her deceitful word her sweet disdain and her fair face a thing which sometime happen principally to him which loveor fear inasmuch a those thing which threaten u do represent to u in sleep the same care which we have in the day awake thesander rise in this imagination begin to search nisa guide by the light of hi soul and not find her it little want that he do not die with grief for her departure neither hi father nor the rest of hi parent have power enough to keep him from run after and so he come to toledo a long time before nisa for a lover who follow that which he lovedoth go faster than he who fly from that which he doth not lovebecause he which doth not lovegrows sorrowful in go and he which loveby go put off hi grief in the meantime lisard much please with pamphilus understand and person have take him to wait in hi chamber not suffer him to live in the baseness of hi first office which he have give him and in this quality he live at toledo with hi master always take great care that hi master parent might not see him because that if they have view him with any consideration they must need have know him but lisard who with frequent conversation with finia whom hi parent do use as lovingly a they could have do nisa be fall in lovewith her reveal this to pamphilus and make him the minister of hi passion give him charge to speak to her and to dispose her with all hi power to be favourable to hi desire pamphilus obey hi master and take occasion one festival day when everybody be abroad go to find finia from lisard but when in come to her he know her to be hi sister and she know him to be her brother they both remain astonished dumb and as immovable a stone but shortly after this first confusion pamphilus begin to speak in this manner sister tell me by what mean thou come hither since celio abandon thee leave thee in barcelona for i know already the whole progress of thy misfortune a conformable unto mine a we be equal in birth by hi mean whom the destiny please say finia to whose dispose my will can not resist lisard brother of my husband celio have find me on the way from saragossa bring me hither where i think i may abide hi return with more honour the same man say pamphilus send me to thee to speak to thee about hi loveand he have find me in a grange which he hath in the mountain of toledo where i have shelter myself from the stroke of fortune under the base condition of the world hath bring me now into this place where thou now see me in the quality of a groom and because that heretofore in the beginning of my fortune i have be in this house i keep myself from be see until this time a thou may well know have not be see until this day by thee suffer and abide the end of thy fortune a i have do and do not say thou know me for i will entertain lisard with some lie from thee until such time that we may see whereunto the revolution of this conjunction of our misfortune will tend and when will end the effect of this our honour eclipse thus do pamphilus and finia meet and instead of reprehend one the other they remain there both good friend for it be ordinary with those who be culpable to dissemble the fault of other l they be reprehend for their own in the meantime thesander go from place to place in toledo inquire for nisa and when this news come to lisards ears that there be a young man which enquire for hi sister he verily think that it be pamphilus who by some sinister accident have lose her be come thither to find her and tell pamphilus the story of nisas ravish which he know much well tell him that he be now in toledo in her quest and that have no man in whose hand he could better commit the satisfaction of hi revenge than hi nor of whose courage and fidelity he could be good assure of he entreat him and conjure him to kill him a notable winding in a success so strange and so embroiled which be so much the more admirable to me who know it good then they who read it how true it be pamphilus astonished to see that he be engage to kill pamphilus or at the least a man who either in search for nisa or els one who for the only disaster of hi name deserve to die endeavour to find him rather to know what he would with nisa than with any mind to execute lisards intent on the other innocence hi master do not accompany him in this action for a tacitus say of nero although he command murder yet he always turn hi sight away from them pamphilus have find thesander privately inquire of the cause why he search for nisa thesander recount the story from nisas be wound by celio and heal by hi father and that she have leave them one night without bid them adieu pay with ingratitude all the good office which be do her in that house neither do he forget to relate how she for the dressing of her wound be constrain to expose her breast she be discover to be a woman from whence proceed hi desire and the cause why he seek her in this place which she say be the place of her birth joyful be pamphilus to hear of the healing of nisas wound and instead of kill thesander he lead him into hi chamber where have use him with all the courtesy that be possible he tell him that in this house where he remain be nisas parent and brother lisard have a great opinion of pamphilus courage pamphilus whom he call maurice do verily believe that he would infallibly kill nisas ravisher which he believe to be thesander wherefore he demand leave of hi father to go fear that if maurice should perhaps be take prisoner he might confess the author of pamphilus death the father afflict at hi departure fear that in this hi age death might take him in the absence of all hi child would know the cause of hi journey and lisard tell him that he have send to kill him who have run away with hi sister who be come to toledo and that he do believe that hi servant unto whom he have give this commission have already execute it put the old man into a great care then he be in before much fear the damage which might come from so violent a revenge pamphilus have persuade thesander to call himself pamphilus to all those who should ask hi name in toledo assure him that he should the sooner hear news of nisa in this time lisard and hi father come into pamphilus chamber to know how he have succeed in the execution of hi command find pamphilus and thesander together they demand of thesander what he be who answer that he be pamphilus lisard draw out hi sword instantly to kill him but he be withhold by hi father who have already know pamphilus tell hi son that the other be pamphilus lisard believe that hi father tell him so to appease him wherefore he fiercely strive to break away from hi father that he might kill thesander say that the other be hi man maurice the whole family drawn thither by the noise and see this rage to prevent great mischief run to the magistrate who hear the stir raise the neighbour lay pamphilus and thesander in two several prison until it be verify which be pamphilus for although that thesander apprehend the danger begin now to say that it be not he be not believe for all believe that fear make him deny hi name in the meantime jacinth be whole of hi
