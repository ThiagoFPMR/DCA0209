enormity of the crime the consequence of a discovery and the probability after what have pass of elviras suspect him to be her daughter ravisher on the other hand it be suggest that she could do no more than suspect that no proof of hi guilt could be produce that it would seem impossible for the rape to have be commit without antonias know when where or by whom and finally he believe that hi fame be too firmly establish to be shake by the unsupported accusation of two unknown woman this latter argument be perfectly false he know not how uncertain be the air of popular applause and that a moment suffice to make him today the detestation of the world who yesterday be it idol the result of the monk deliberation be that he should proceed in hi enterprize he ascend the step lead to the house no sooner do he touch the door with the silver myrtle than it fly open and present him with a free passage he enter and the door close after him of it own accord guide by the moonbeam he proceed

object before him the heat of the weather have oblige her to throw off part of the bedcloathes those which still cover her ambrosios insolent hand hasten to remove she lay with her cheek recline upon one ivory arm the other rest on the side of the bed with graceful indolence a few tress of her hair have escape from beneath the muslin which confine the rest and fell carelessly over her bosom a it heave with slow and regular suspiration the warm air have spread her cheek with high colour than usual a smile inexpressibly sweet played round her ripe and coral lip from which every now and then escape a gentle sigh or an halfpronounced sentence an air of enchant innocence and candour pervade her whole form and there be a sort of modesty in her very nakedness which add fresh sting to the desire of the lustful monk he remain for some moment devour those charm with hi eye which soon be to be subject to hi illregulated passion her mouth halfopened seem to solicit a kiss he bend over her he join hi lip to hers and drew in the fragrance of her breath with rapture this momentary pleasure increase hi longing for still great hi desire be raise to that frantic height by which brute be
