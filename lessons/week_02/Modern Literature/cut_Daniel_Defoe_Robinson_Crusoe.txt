the life and adventure of robinson crusoe i be bear in the year in the city of york of a good family though not of that country my father be a foreigner of bremen who settle first at hull he get a good estate by merchandise and leave off hi trade live afterwards at york from whence he have marry my mother whose relation be name robinson a very good family in that country and from whom i be call robinson kreutznaer but by the usual corruption of word in england we be now call nay we call ourselves and write our name crusoe and so my companion always call me i have two elder brother one of which be lieutenantcolonel to an english regiment of foot in flanders formerly command by the famous colonel lockhart and be kill at the battle near dunkirk against the spaniard what become of my second brother i never know any more than my father or mother do know what be become of me be the third son of the family and not breed to any trade my head begin to be fill very early with ramble thought my father who be very ancient have give me a competent share of learn as far a house education and a country freeschool generally go and design me for the law but i would be satisfy with nothing but go to sea and my inclination to this lead me so strongly against the will nay the command of my father and against all the entreaty and persuasion of my mother and other friend that there seem to be something fatal in that propension of nature tend directly to the life of misery which be to befal me my father a wise and grave man give me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresee be my design he call me one morning into hi chamber where he be confine by the gout and expostulate very warmly with me upon this subject he ask me what reason more than a mere wander inclination i have for leave my father house and my native country where i might be well introduce and have a prospect of raise my fortune by application and industry with a life of ease and pleasure he tell me it be for men of desperate fortune on one hand or of aspire superior fortune on the other who go abroad upon adventure to rise by enterprise and make themselves famous in undertaking of a nature out of the common road that these thing be all either too far above me or too far below me that mine be the middle state or what might be call the upper station of low life which he have find by long experience be the best state in the world the most suited to human happiness not expose to the misery and hardships the labour and suffering of the mechanic part of mankind and not embarrass with the pride luxury ambition and envy of the upper part of mankind he tell me i might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing viz that this be the state of life which all other people envy that king have frequently lament the miserable consequence of be bear to great thing and wish they have be place in the middle of the two extreme between the mean and the great that the wise man give hi testimony to this a the just standard of true felicity when he pray to have neither poverty nor rich he bid me observe it and i should always find that the calamity of life be share among the upper and low part of mankind but that the middle station have the few disaster and be not expose to so many vicissitude a the high or low part of mankind nay they be not subject to so many distemper and uneasinesses either of body or mind a those be who by vicious live luxury and extravagance on one hand or by hard labour want of necessary and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequence of their way of living that the middle station of life be calculate for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyment that peace and plenty be the handmaid of a middle fortune that temperance moderation quietness health society all agreeable diversion and all desirable pleasure be the blessing attend the middle station of life that this way men go silently and smoothly through the world and comfortably out of it not embarrass with the labour of the hand or of the head not sell to the life of slavery for daily bread or harass with perplexed circumstance which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest not enrage with the passion of envy or secret burning lust of ambition for great thing but in easy circumstance slide gently through the world and sensibly taste the sweet of living without the bitter feeling that they be happy and learning by every day experience to know it more sensibly after this he press me earnestly and in the most affectionate manner not to play the young man not to precipitate myself into misery which nature and the station of life i be bear in seem to have provide against that i be under no necessity of seek my bread that he would do well for me and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he have be just recommend to me and that if i be not very easy and happy in the world it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it and that he should have nothing to answer for have thus discharge hi duty in warn me against measure which he know would be to my hurt in a word that a he would do very kind thing for me if i would stay and settle at home a he direct so he would not have so much hand in my misfortune a to give me any encouragement to go away and to close all he tell me i have my elder brother for an example to whom he have use the same earnest persuasion to keep him from go into the low country war but could not prevail hi young desire prompt him to run into the army where he be kill and though he say he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i do take this foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observe in this last part of hi discourse which be truly prophetic though i suppose my father do not know it to be so himself i say i observe the tear run down hi face very plentifully and especially when he speak of my brother who be kill and that when he speak of my have leisure to repent and none to assist me he be so moved that he break off the discourse and tell me hi heart be so full he could say no more to me i be sincerely affect with this discourse a indeed who could be otherwise and i resolve not to think of go abroad any more but to settle at home accord to my father desire but alas a few day wear it all off and in short to prevent any of my father farther importunity in a few week after i resolve to run quite away from him however i do not act so hastily neither a my first heat of resolution prompt but i take my mother at a time when i think her a little pleasanter than ordinary and tell her that my thought be so entirely bent upon see the world that i should never settle to any thing with resolution enough to go through with it and my father have well give me hi consent than force me to go without it that i be now eighteen year old which be too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i be sure if i do i should never serve out my time and i should certainly run away from my master before my time be out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i come home again and do not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover that time i have lose this put my mother into a great passion she tell me she know it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he know too well what be my interest to give hi consent to any such thing so much for my hurt and that she wonder how i could think of any such thing after such a discourse a i have have with my father and such kind and tender expression a she know my father have use to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there be no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother be willing when my father be not though my mother refuse to move it to my father yet a i have hear afterwards she report all the discourse to him and that my father after shew a great concern at it say to her with a sigh that boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he go abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that be ever bear i can give no consent to it it be not till almost a year after this that i break loose though in the meantime i continue obstinately deaf to all proposal of settle to business and frequently expostulate with my father and mother about their be so positively determine against what they know my inclination prompt me to but be one day at hull where i go casually and without any purpose of make an elopement that time but i say be there and one of my companion be go by sea to london in hi father ship and prompt me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men viz that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consult neither father or mother any more not so much a sent them word of it but leave them to hear of it a they might without ask god blessing or my father without any consideration of circumstance or consequence and in an ill hour god know on the first of september i go on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer misfortune i believe begin sooner or continue long than mine the ship be no sooner get out of the humber but the wind begin to blow and the wave to rise in a most frightful manner and a i have never be at sea before i be most inexpressibly sick in body and terrify in mind i begin now seriously to reflect upon what i have do and how justly i be overtake by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leave my father house and abandon my duty all the good counsel of my parent my father tear and my mother entreaty come now fresh into my mind and my conscience which be not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it have be since reproach me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increase and the sea which i have never be upon before go very high though nothing like what i have see many time since no nor like what i saw a few day after but it be enough to affect me then who be but a young sailor and have never know any thing of the matter i expect every wave would have swallow u up and that every time the ship fell down a i think in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more and in this agony of mind i make many vow and resolution that if it would please god here to spare my life this one voyage if ever i get once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set it into a ship again while i live that i would take hi advice and never run myself into such misery a these any more now i saw plainly the goodness of hi observation about the middle station of life how easy how comfortably he have live all hi day and never have be expose to tempest at sea or trouble on shore and i resolve that i would like a true repenting prodigal go home to my father these wise and sober thought continue all the while the storm continue and indeed some time after but the next day the wind be abate and the sea calmer and i begin to be a little inured to it however i be very grave for all that day be also a little seasick still but towards night the weather clear up the wind be quite over and a charming fine evening follow the sun go down perfectly clear and rise so the next morning and have little or no wind and a smooth sea the sun shin upon it the sight be a i think the most delightful that ever i saw i have sleep well in the night and be now no more seasick but very cheerful look with wonder upon the sea that be so rough and terrible the day before and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time after and now l my good resolution should continue my companion who have indeed entice me away come to me well bob say he clap me upon the shoulder how do you do after it i warrant you be fright want you last night when it blow but a capful of winda capful do you call it say i it be a terrible storma storm you fool you reply he do you call that a storm why it be nothing at all give u but a good ship and searoom and we think nothing of such a squall of wind a that but youre but a freshwater sailor bob come let u make a bowl of punch and well forget all that do you see what charm weather it be now to make short this sad part of my story we go the old way of all sailor the punch be make and i be make drunk with it and in that one night wickedness i drown all my repentance all my reflection upon my past conduct and all my resolution for my future in a word a the sea be return to it smoothness of surface and settle calmness by the abatement of that storm so the hurry of my thought be over my fear and apprehension of be swallow up by the sea be forget and the current of my former desire return i entirely forget the vow and promise that i make in my distress i find indeed some interval of reflection and the serious thought do a it be endeavour to return again sometimes but i shake them off and rouse myself from them a it be from a distemper and apply myself to drink and company soon master the return of those fit for so i call them and i have in five or six day get a complete a victory over conscience a any young fellow that resolve not to be trouble with it could desire but i be to have another trial for it still and providence a in such case generally it do resolve to leave me entirely without excuse for if i would not take this for a deliverance the next be to be such a one a the bad and most hardened wretch among u would confess both the danger and the mercy the sixth day of our be at sea we come into yarmouth road the wind have be contrary and the weather calm we have make but little way since the storm here we be oblige to come to anchor and here we lay the wind continue contrary viz at southwest for seven or eight day during which time a great many ship from newcastle come into the same road a the common harbour where the ship might wait for a wind for the river we have not however rid here so long but should have tide it up the river but that the wind blow too fresh and after we have lie four or five day blow very hard however the road be reckon as good a a harbour the anchorage good and our ground tackle very strong our men be unconcerned and not in the least apprehensive of danger but spend the time in rest and mirth after the manner of the sea but the eighth day in the morning the wind increase and we have all hand at work to strike our topmast and make every thing snug and close that the ship might ride as easy a possible by noon the sea go very high indeed and our ship rid forecastle in shipped several sea and we think once or twice our anchor have come home upon which our master order out the sheet anchor so that we ride with two anchor ahead and the cable veer out to the good end by this time it blow a terrible storm indeed and now i begin to see terror and amazement in the face even of the seaman themselves the master though vigilant in the business of preserve the ship yet a he go in and out of hi cabin by me i could hear him softly to himself say several time lord be merciful to u we shall be all lose we shall be all undone and the like during these first hurry i be stupid lying still in my cabin which be in the steerage and can not describe my temper i could ill reassume the first penitence which i have so apparently trample upon and harden myself against i think the bitterness of death have be past and that this would be nothing like the first but when the master himself come by me a i say just now and say we should be all lose i be dreadfully fright i get up out of my cabin and look out but such a dismal sight i never saw the sea go mountain high and break upon u every three or four minute when i could look about i could see nothing but distress round u two ship that rid near u we find have cut their mast by the board be deep loaden and our men cry out that a ship which rid about a mile ahead of u be founder two more ship be drive from their anchor be run out of the road to sea at all adventure and that with not a mast stand the light ship fare the best a not so much labouring in the sea but two or three of them drive and come close by u run away with only their spritsail out before the wind towards even the mate and boatswain beg the master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast which he be very unwilling to do but the boatswain protest to him that if he do not the ship would founder he consent and when they have cut away the foremast the mainmast stand so loose and shake the ship so much they be oblige to cut her away also and make a clear deck any one may judge what a condition i must be in at all this who be but a young sailor and who have be in such a fright before at but a little but if i can express at this distance the thought i have about me at that time i be in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former conviction and the have return from them to the resolution i have wickedly take at first than i be at death itself and these add to the terror of the storm put me in such a condition that i can by no word describe it but the bad be not come yet the storm continue with such fury that the seaman themselves acknowledge they have never know a worse we have a good ship but she be deep loaden and wallow in the sea that the seaman every now and then cry out she would founder it be my advantage in one respect that i do not know what they mean by founder till i inquire however the storm be so violent that i saw what be not often see the master the boatswain and some other more sensible than the rest at their prayer and expect every moment when the ship would go to the bottom in the middle of the night and under all the rest of our distress one of the men that have be down on purpose to see cry out we have spring a leak another say there be four foot water in the hold then all hand be call to the pump at that very word my heart a i think die within me and i fell backwards upon the side of my bed where i sit into the cabin however the men rouse me and tell me that i that be able to do nothing before be as well able to pump a another at which i stir up and go to the pump and work very heartily while this be do the master see some light collier who not able to ride out the storm be oblige to slip and run away to sea and would come near u order to fire a gun a a signal of distress i who know nothing what that meant be so surprised that i think the ship have break or some dreadful thing happen in a word i be so surprised that i fell down in a swoon a this be a time when every body have hi own life to think of nobody mind me or what be become of me but another man stept up to the pump and thrust me aside with hi foot let me lie think i have be dead and it be a great while before i come to myself we work on but the water increase in the hold it be apparent that the ship would founder and though the storm begin to abate a little yet a it be not possible she could swim till we might run into a port so the master continue firing gun for help and a light ship who have rid it out just ahead of u venture a boat out to help u it be with the utmost hazard the boat come near u but it be impossible for a to get on board or for the boat to lie near the ship side till at last the men row very heartily and venture their life to save ours our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it and then veer it out a great length which they after great labour and hazard take hold of and we haul them close under our stern and get all into their boat it be to no purpose for them or u after we be in the boat to think of reach to their own ship so all agree to let her drive and only to pull her in towards shore as much a we could and our master promise them that if the boat be stave upon shore he would make it good to their master so partly row and partly drive our boat go away to the northward sloping towards the shore almost as far a wintertonness we be not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we saw her sink and then i understand for the first time what be mean by a ship foundering in the sea i must acknowledge i have hardly eye to look up when the seaman tell me she be sink for from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that i might be say to go in my heart be a it be dead within me partly with fright partly with horror of mind and the thought of what be yet before me while we be in this condition the men yet labour at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see when our boat mount the wave we be able to see the shore a great many people run along the shore to assist u when we should come near but we make but slow way towards the shore nor be we able to reach the shore till be past the lighthouse at winterton the shore fall off to the westward towards cromer and so the land break off a little the violence of the wind here we get in and though not without much difficulty get all safe on shore and walk afterwards on foot to yarmouth where a unfortunate men we be use with great humanity as well by the magistrate of the town who assign u good quarter a by particular merchant and owner of ship and have money give u sufficient to carry u either to london or back to hull a we think fit have i now have the sense to have go back to hull and have go home i have be happy and my father an emblem of our blessed saviour parable have even kill the fatted calf for me for hear the ship i go away in be cast away in yarmouth road it be a great while before he have any assurance that i be not drown but my ill fate push me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist and though i have several time loud call from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home yet i have no power to do it i know not what to call this nor will i urge that it be a secret overruling decree that hurry u on to be the instrument of our own destruction even though it be before u and that we push upon it with our eye open certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending and which it be impossible for me to escape could have push me forward against the calm reasoning and persuasion of my most retired thought and against two such visible instruction a i have meet with in my first attempt my comrade who have help to harden me before and who be the master son be now less forward than i the first time he speak to me after we be at yarmouth which be not till two or three day for we be separate in the town to several quarter i say the first time he saw me it appear hi tone be alter and look very melancholy and shake hi head ask me how i do and tell hi father who i be and how i have come this voyage only for a trial in order to go far abroad hi father turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone young man say he you ought never to go to sea any more you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you be not to be a seafaring manwhy sir say i will you go to sea no more that be another case say he it be my call and therefore my duty but a you make this voyage for a trial you see what a taste heaven have give you of what you be to expect if you persist perhaps this be all befallen u on your account like jonah in the ship of tarshish pray continue he what be you and on what account do you go to sea upon that i tell him some of my story at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion what have i do say he that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pound this indeed be a i say an excursion of hi spirit which be yet agitate by the sense of hi loss and be far than he could have authority to go however he afterwards talked very gravely to me exhort me to go back to my father and not tempt providence to my ruin tell me i might see a visible hand of heaven against me and young man say he depend upon it if you do not go back wherever you go you will meet with nothing but disaster and disappointment till your father word be fulfil upon you we part soon after for i make him little answer and i saw him no more which way he go i know not a for me have some money in my pocket i travel to london by land and there as well a on the road have many struggle with myself what course of life i should take and whether i should go home or go to sea a to go home shame oppose the best motion that offer to my thought and it immediately occur to me how i should be laugh at among the neighbour and should be ashamed to see not my father and mother only but even every body els from whence i have since often observe how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind be especially of youth to that reason which ought to guide them in such case viz that they be not ashamed to sin and yet be ashamed to repent nor ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteem fool but be ashamed of the return which only can make them be esteem wise men in this state of life however i remain some time uncertain what measure to take and what course of life to lead an irresistible reluctance continue to go home and a i stay a while the remembrance of the distress i have be in wore off and a that abate the little motion i have in my desire to a return wear off with it till at last i quite lay aside the thought of it and look out for a voyage that evil influence which carry me first away from my father house that hurry me into the wild and indigested notion of raise my fortune and that impress those conceit so forcibly upon me a to make me deaf to all good advice and to the entreaty and even the command of my father i say the same influence whatever it be present the most unfortunate of all enterprise to my view and i go on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa or a our sailor vulgarly call it a voyage to guinea it be my great misfortune that in all these adventure i do not ship myself a a sailor whereby though i might indeed have work a little hard than ordinary yet at the same time i have learn the duty and office of a foremastman and in time might have qualify myself for a mate or lieutenant if not for a master but a it be always my fate to choose for the bad so i do here for have money in my pocket and good clothes upon my back i would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman and so i neither have any business in the ship or learnt to do any it be my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in london which do not always happen to such loose and unguided young fellow a i then be the devil generally not omit to lay some snare for them very early but it be not so with me i first fell acquaint with the master of a ship who have be on the coast of guinea and who have have very good success there be resolve to go again and who take a fancy to my conversation which be not at all disagreeable at that time hear me say i have a mind to see the world tell me if i would go the voyage with him i should be at no expense i should be hi messmate and hi companion and if i could carry any thing with me i should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit and perhaps i might meet with some encouragement i embrace the offer and enter into a strict friendship with this captain who be an honest and plaindealing man i go the voyage with him and carry a small adventure with me which by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain i increase very considerably for i carry about l in such toy and trifle a the captain direct me to buy this l i have muster together by the assistance of some of my relation whom i correspond with and who i believe get my father or at least my mother to contribute so much a that to my first adventure this be the only voyage which i may say be successful in all my adventure and which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain under whom also i get a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rule of navigation learn how to keep an account of the ship course take an observation and in short to understand some thing that be needful to be understand by a sailor for a he take delight to instruct me i take delight to learn and in a word this voyage make me both a sailor and a merchant for i bring home five pound nine ounce of golddust for my adventure which yield me in london at my return almost l and this fill me with those aspire thought which have so complete my ruin yet even in this voyage i have my misfortune too particularly that i be continually sick be throw into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate our principal trading be upon the coast from the latitude of degree north even to the line itself i be now set up for a guinea trader and my friend to my great misfortune die soon after hi arrival i resolve to go the same voyage again and i embark in the same vessel with one who be hi mate in the former voyage and have now get the command of the ship this be the unhappy voyage that ever man make for though i do not carry quite l of my newgained wealth so that i have l left and which i lodge with my friend widow who be very just to me yet i fell into terrible misfortune in this voyage and the first be this viz our ship make her course towards the canary island or rather between those island and the african shore be surprise in the grey of the morning by a turkish rover of sallee who give chase to u with all the sail she could make we crowd also as much canvas a our yard would spread or our mast carry to have get clear but find the pirate gain upon u and would certainly come up with u in a few hour we prepare to fight our ship have twelve gun and the rogue eighteen about three in the afternoon he come up with u and bring to by mistake just athwart our quarter instead of athwart our stern a he intend we bring eight of our gun to bear on that side and pour in a broadside upon him which make him sheer off again after return our fire and pouring in also hi smallshot from near men which he have on board however we have not a man touch all our men keep close he prepare to attack u again and we to defend ourselves but lay u on board the next time upon our other quarter he enter sixty men upon our deck who immediately fell to cut and hack the deck and rig we ply them with smallshot halfpikes powdercheats and such like and clear our deck of them twice however to cut short this melancholy part of our story our ship be disable and three of our men kill and eight wound we be oblige to yield and be carry all prisoner into sallee a port belong to the moor the usage i have there be not so dreadful a at first i apprehend nor be i carry up the country to the emperor court a the rest of our men be but be keep by the captain of the rover a hi proper prize and make hi slave be young and nimble and fit for hi business at this surprising change of my circumstance from a merchant to a miserable slave i be perfectly overwhelm and now i look back upon my father prophetic discourse to me that i should be miserable and have none to relieve me which i think be now so effectually bring to pass that i could not be bad that now the hand of heaven have overtake me and i be undone without redemption but ala this be but a taste of the misery i be to go through as will appear in the sequel of this story a my new patron or master have take me home to hi house so i be in hope that he would take me with him when he go to sea again believe that it would sometime or other be hi fate to be take by a spanish or portugal man of war and that then i should be set at liberty but this hope of mine be soon take away for when he go to sea he leave me on shore to look after hi little garden and do the common drudgery of slave about hi house and when he come home again from hi cruise he order me to be in the cabin to look after the ship here i meditate nothing but my escape and what method i might take to effect it but find no way that have the least probability in it nothing present to make the supposition of it rational for i have nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me no fellow slave no englishman irishman or scotsman there but myself so that for two year though i often please myself with the imagination yet i never have the least encouraging prospect of put it in practice after about two year an odd circumstance present itself which put the old thought of make some attempt for my liberty again in my head my patron lie at home long than usual without fit out hi ship which a i hear be for want of money he use constantly once or twice a week sometimes oftener if the weather be fair to take the ship pinnace and go out into the road afishing and a he always take me and a young maresco with him to row the boat we make him very merry and i prove very dexterous in catch fish insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor one of hi kinsman and the youth the maresco a they call him to catch a dish of fish for him it happen one time that go afishing in a stark calm morning a fog rise so thick that though we be not half a league from the shore we lose sight of it and row we know not whither or which way we labour all day and all the next night and when the morning come we find we have pull off to sea instead of pull in for the shore and that we be at least two league from the shore however we get well in again though with a great deal of labour and some danger for the wind begin to blow pretty fresh in the morning but particularly we be all very hungry but our patron warn by this disaster resolve to take more care of himself for the future and have lie by him the longboat of our english ship he have take he resolve he would not go afishing any more without a compass and some provision so he order the carpenter of hi ship who also be an english slave to build a little stateroom or cabin in the middle of the longboat like that of a barge with a place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the mainsheet and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sail she sail with that we call a shoulder of mutton sail and the boom gibe over the top of the cabin which lay very snug and low and have in it room for him to lie with a slave or two and a table to eat on with some small locker to put in some bottle of such liquor a he think fit to drink particularly hi bread rice and coffee we go frequently out with this boat afishing and a i be most dexterous to catch fish for him he never go without me it happen that he have appoint to go out in this boat either for pleasure or for fish with two or three moor of some distinction in that place and for whom he have provide extraordinarily and have therefore send on board the boat overnight a large store of provision than ordinary and have order me to get ready three fuzee with powder and shot which be on board hi ship for that they design some sport of fowling as well a fishing i get all thing ready a he have direct and wait the next morning with the boat wash clean her ancient and pendant out and every thing to accommodate hi guest when by and by my patron come on board alone and tell me hi guest have put off go upon some business that fell out and order me with the man and boy as usual to go out with the boat and catch them some fish for that hi friend be to sup at hi house and command that as soon a i get some fish i should bring it home to hi house all which i prepare to do this moment my former notion of deliverance dart into my thought for now i find i be like to have a little ship at my command and my master be go i prepare to furnish myself not for fish business but for a voyage though i know not neither do i so much a consider whither i should steer for any where to get out of that place be my way my first contrivance be to make a pretence to speak to this moor to get something for our subsistence on board for i tell him we must not presume to eat of our patron bread he say that be true so he bring a large basket of rusk or bisket of their kind and three jar with fresh water into the boat i know where my patron case of bottle stand which it be evident by the make be take out of some english prize and i convey them into the boat while the moor be on shore a if they have be there before for our master i convey also a great lump of beeswax into the boat which weigh above half a hundred weight with a parcel of twine or thread a hatchet a saw and a hammer all which be of great use to u afterwards especially the wax to make candle another trick i try upon him which he innocently come into also hi name be ismael whom they call muly or moley so i call to him moley say i our patron gun be on board the boat can you not get a little powder and shot it may be we may kill some alcamies a fowl like our curlew for ourselves for i know he keep the gunner store in the shipyes say he ill bring some and accordingly he bring a great leather pouch which hold about a pound and a half of powder or rather more and another with shot that have five or six pound with some bullet and put all into the boat at the same time i have find some powder of my master in the great cabin with which i fill one of the large bottle in the case which be almost empty pour what be in it into another and thus furnish with every thing needful we sail out of the port to fish the castle which be at the entrance of the port know who we be and take no notice of u and we be not above a mile out of the port before we hale in our sail and set u down to fish the wind blew from the nne which be contrary to my desire for have it blown southerly i have be sure to have make the coast of spain and at last reach to the bay of cadiz but my resolution be blow which way it would i would be go from that horrid place where i be and leave the rest to fate after we have fish some time and catch nothing for when i have fish on my hook i would not pull them up that he might not see them i say to the moor this will not do our master will not be thus serve we must stand far off he think no harm agree and be in the head of the boat set the sail and a i have the helm i run the boat out near a league farther and then bring her to a if i would fish when give the boy the helm i step forward to where the moor be and make a if i stoop for something behind him i take him by surprise with my arm under hi twist and toss him clear overboard into the sea he rise immediately for he swim like a cork and call to me beg to be take in told me he would go all over the world with me he swim so strong after the boat that he would have reach me very quickly there be but little wind upon which i step into the cabin and fetch one of the fowlingpieces i present it at him and tell him i have do him no hurt and if he would be quiet i would do him none but say i you swim well enough to reach to the shore and the sea be calm make the best of your way to shore and i will do you no harm but if you come near the boat ill shoot you through the head for i be resolve to have my liberty so he turn himself about and swim for the shore and i make no doubt but he reach it with ease for he be an excellent swimmer i could have be content to have take this moor with me and have drown the boy but there be no venturing to trust him when he be go i turn to the boy whom they call xury and say to him xury if you will be faithful to me ill make you a great man but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that be swear by mahomet and hi father beard i must throw you into the sea too the boy smile in my face and speak so innocently that i could not mistrust him and swear to be faithful to me and go all over the world with me while i be in view of the moor that be swim i stand out directly to sea with the boat rather stretch to windward that they might think me go towards the strait mouth a indeed any one that have be in their wit must have be suppose to do for who would have suppose we be sail on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast where whole nation of negro be sure to surround u with the canoe and destroy u where we could never once go on shore but we should be devour by savage beast or more merciless savage of human kind but as soon a it grow dusk in the evening i change my course and steer directly south and by east bending my course a little toward the east that i might keep in with the shore and have a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth quiet sea i make such sail that i believe by the next day at three oclock in the afternoon when i first make the land i could not be less than mile south of sallee quite beyond the emperor of morocco dominion or indeed of any other king thereabouts for we saw no people yet such be the fright i have take at the moor and the dreadful apprehension i have of fall into their hand that i would not stop or go on shore or come to an anchor the wind continue fair till i have sail in that manner five day and then the wind shift to the southward i conclude also that if any of our vessel be in chase of me they also would now give over so i venture to make to the coast and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river i know not what or where neither what latitude what country what nation or what river i neither saw or desire to see any people the principal thing i want be fresh water we come into this creek in the evening resolve to swim on shore as soon a it be dark and discover the country but as soon a it be quite dark we hear such dreadful noise of the barking roaring and howling of wild creature of we know not what kinds that the poor boy be ready to die with fear and begged of me not to go on shore till day well xury say i then i wont but it may be we may see men by day who will be a bad to u a those lionsthen we give them the shoot gun say xury laugh make them run wey such english xury spoke by converse among u slave however i be glad to see the boy so cheerful and i give him a dram out of our patron case of bottle to cheer him up after all xurys advice be good and i take it we drop our little anchor and lay still all night i say still for we sleep none for in two or three hour we saw vast great creature we know not what to call them of many sort come down to the seashore and run into the water wallowing and wash themselves for the pleasure of cool themselves and they make such hideous howling and yelling that i never indeed hear the like xury be dreadfully fright and indeed so be i too but we be both more frighted when we hear one of these mighty creature come swimming towards our boat we could not see him but we might hear him by hi blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast xury say it be a lion and it might be so for aught i know but poor xury cry to me to weigh the anchor and row away no say i xury we can slip our cable with the buoy to it and go off to sea they can not follow u far i have no sooner say so but i perceive the creature whatever it be within two oar length which something surprise me however i immediately step to the cabindoor and take up my gun fire at him upon which he immediately turn about and swim towards the shore again but it be impossible to describe the horrible noise and hideous cry and howling that be raise as well upon the edge of the shore a high within the country upon the noise or report of the gun a thing i have some reason to believe those creature have never hear before this convince me that there be no go on shore for u in the night upon that coast and how to venture on shore in the day be another question too for to have fall into the hand of any of the savage have be as bad a to have fall into the hand of lion and tiger at least we be equally apprehensive of the danger of it be that a it would we be oblige to go on shore somewhere or other for water for we have not a pint left in the boat when or where to get it be the point xury say if i would let him go on shore with one of the jar he would find if there be any water and bring some to me i ask him why he would go why i should not go and he stay in the boat the boy answer with so much affection that make me love him ever after say he if wild man come they eat me you go weywell xury say i we will both go and if the wild man come we will kill them they shall eat neither of u so i give xury a piece of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our patron case of bottle which i mention before and we hale the boat in a near the shore a we think be proper and wad on shore carry nothing but our arm and two jar for water i do not care to go out of sight of the boat fear the come of canoe with savage down the river but the boy see a low place about a mile up the country ramble to it and by and by i saw him come running towards me i think he be pursue by some savage or fright with some wild beast and i run forward towards him to help him but when i come nearer to him i saw something hanging over hi shoulder which be a creature that he have shoot like a hare but different in colour and long leg however we be very glad of it and it be very good meat but the great joy that poor xury come with be to tell me that he have find good water and see no wild man but we find afterwards that we need not take such pain for water for a little high up the creek where we be we find the water fresh when the tide be out which flow but a little way up so we fill our jar and feast on the hare we have kill and prepare to go on our way have see no footstep of any human creature in that part of the country a i have be one voyage to this coast before i know very well that the island of the canary and the cape de verd island also lay not far off from the coast but a i have no instrument to take an observation to know what latitude we be in and not exactly know or at least remember what latitude they be in and know not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea towards them otherwise i might now easily have find some of these island but my hope be that if i stand along this coast till i come to that part where the english trade i should find some of their vessel upon their usual design of trade that would relieve and take u in by the best of my calculation that place where i now be must be that country which lie between the emperor of morocco dominion and the negro lie waste and uninhabited except by wild beast the negro have abandon it and go far south for fear of the moor and the moor not think it worth inhabit by reason of it barrenness and indeed both forsake it because of the prodigious number of tiger lion leopard and other furious creature which harbour there so that the moor use it for their hunting only where they go like an army two or three thousand men at a time and indeed for near an hundred mile together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day and heard nothing but howling and roaring of wild beast by night once or twice in the daytime i think i saw the pico of teneriffe be the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canary and have a great mind to venture out in hope of reach thither but have tried twice i be force in again by contrary wind the sea also go too high for my little vessel so i resolve to pursue my first design and keep along the shore several time i be oblige to land for fresh water after we have leave this place and once in particular be early in the morning we come to an anchor under a little point of land which be pretty high and the tide beginning to flow we lay still to go far in xury whose eye be more about him than it seem mine be call softly to me and tell me that we have best go far off the shore for say he look yonder lie a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep i look where he point and saw a dreadful monster indeed for it be a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore under the shade of a piece of the hill that hang a it be a little over him xury say i you shall go on shore and kill him xury look fright and say me kill he eat me at one mouth one mouthful he mean however i say no more to the boy but have him lie still and i take our big gun which be almost musketbore and load it with a good charge of powder and with two slug and lay it down then i load another gun with two bullet and the third for we have three piece i load with five small bullet i take the best aim i could with the first piece to have shoot him into the head but he lay so with hi leg raise a little above hi nose that the slug hit hi leg about the knee and break the bone he start up growl at first but find hi leg break fell down again and then get up upon three leg and give the most hideous roar that ever i hear i be a little surprised that i have not hit him on the head however i look up the second piece immediately and though he begin to move off fire again and shoot him into the head and have the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise but he struggle for life then xury take heart and would have me let him go on shore well go say i so the boy jump into the water and take a little gun in one hand swam to shore with the other hand and come close to the creature put the muzzle of the piece to hi ear and shot him into the head again which dispatch him quite this be game indeed to u but this be no food and i be very sorry to lose three charge of powder and shot upon a creature that be good for nothing to u however xury say he would have some of him so he come on board and ask me to give him the hatchet for what xury say i me cut off hi head say he however xury could not cut off hi head but he cut off a foot and bring it with him and it be a monstrous great one i bethink myself however that perhaps the skin of him might one way or other be of some value to u and i resolve to take off hi skin if i could so xury and i go to work with him but xury be much the good workman at it for i know very ill how to do it indeed it take u up both the whole day but at last we get off the hide of him and spread it on the top of our cabin the sun effectually dry it in two day time and it afterwards serve me to lie upon after this stop we make on to the southward continually for ten or twelve day live very spar on our provision which begin to abate very much and go no oftener into the shore than we be oblige to for fresh water my design in this be to make the river gambia or senegal that be to say any where about the cape de verd where i be in hope to meet with some european ship and if i do not i know not what course i have to take but to seek for the island or perish there among the negro i know that all the ship from europe which sail either to the coast of guinea or brasil or to the east indie make this cape or those island and in a word i put the whole of my fortune upon this single point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i have pass this resolution about ten day longer a i have say i begin to see that the land be inhabit and in two or three place a we sail by we saw people stand upon the shore to look at u we could also perceive that they be quite black and stark naked i be once incline to have go on shore to them but xury be my good counsellor and say to me no go no go however i haul in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i find they run along the shore by me a good way i observe they have no weapon in their hand except one who have a long slender stick which xury say be a lance and that they would throw them a great way with good aim so i keep at a distance but talk with them by sign as well a i could and particularly make sign for something to eat they beckon to me to stop my boat and they would fetch me some meat upon this i lower the top of my sail and lay by and two of them run up into the country and in less than half an hour come back and bring with them two piece of dry flesh and some corn such a be the produce of their country but we neither know what the one nor the other be however we be willing to accept it but how to come at it be our next dispute for i be not for venture on shore to them and they be as much afraid of u but they take a safe way for u all for they bring it to the shore and lay it down and go and stand a great way off till we fetch it on board and then come close to u again we make sign of thanks to them for we have nothing to make them amends but an opportunity offer that very instant to oblige them wonderfully for while we be lie by the shore come two mighty creature one pursue the other a we take it with great fury from the mountain towards the sea whether it be the male pursue the female or whether they be in sport or in rage we could not tell any more than we could tell whether it be usual or strange but i believe it be the latter because in the first place those ravenous creature seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we find the people terribly fright especially the woman the man that have the lance or dart do not fly from them but the rest do however a the two creature run directly into the water they do not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negro but plunge themselves into the sea and swam about a if they have come for their diversion at last one of them begin to come nearer our boat than at first i expect but i lay ready for him for i have load my gun with all possible expedition and have xury load both the other as soon a he come fairly within my reach i fire and shoot him directly into the head immediately he sink down into the water but rise instantly and plunge up and down as if he be struggle for life and so indeed he be he immediately make to the shore but between the wound which be hi mortal hurt and the strangling of the water he die just before he reach the shore it be impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creature at the noise and the fire of my gun some of them be even ready to die for fear and fell down as dead with the very terror but when they saw the creature dead and sunk in the water and that i make sign to them to come to the shore they take heart and come to the shore and begin to search for the creature i find him by hi blood stain the water and by the help of a rope which i sling round him and give the negro to hale they drag him on shore and find that it be a most curious leopard spot and fine to an admirable degree and the negro hold up their hand with admiration to think what it be i have kill him with the other creature fright with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun swam on shore and run up directly to the mountain from whence they come nor could i at that distance know what it be i find quickly the negro be for eat the flesh of this creature so i be willing to have them take it a a favour from me which when i make sign to them that they might take him they be very thankful for immediately they fell to work with him and though they have no knife yet with a sharpened piece of wood they take off hi skin a readily and much more readily than we could have do with a knife they offer me some of the flesh which i decline make a if i would give it them but make sign for the skin which they give me very freely and bring me a great deal more of their provision which though i do not understand yet i accept then i make sign to them for some water and hold out one of my jar to them turn it bottom upward to shew that it be empty and that i want to have it fill they call immediately to some of their friend and there come two woman and bring a great vessel make of earth and burnt a i suppose in the sun this they set down for me a before and i send xury on shore with my jar and fill them all three the woman be a stark naked a the men i be now furnish with root and corn such a it be and water and leave my friendly negro i make forward for about eleven day more without offer to go near the shore till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea at about the distance of four or five league before me and the sea be very calm i keep a large offing to make this point at length double the point at about two league from the land i saw plainly land on the other side to seaward then i conclude a it be most certain indeed that this be the cape de verd and those the island call from thence cape de verd island however they be at a great distance and i could not well tell what i have best to do for if i should be take with a fresh of wind i might neither reach one nor the other in this dilemma a i be very pensive i step into the cabin and sit me down xury have the helm when on a sudden the boy cry out master master a ship with a sail and the foolish boy be fright out of hi wit think it must need be some of hi master ship send to pursue u when i know we be get far enough out of their reach i jump out of the cabin and immediately saw not only the ship but what she be viz that it be a portuguese ship and a i think be bind to the coast of guinea for negro but when i observe the course she steer i be soon convinced they be bind some other way and do not design to come any nearer to the shore upon which i stretch out to sea as much a i could resolve to speak with them if possible with all the sail i could muster i find i should not be able to come in their way but that they would be go by before i could make any signal to them but after i have crowd to the utmost and begin to despair they it seem saw me by the help of their perspectiveglasses and that it be some european boat which a they suppose must belong to some ship that be lose so they shorten sail to let me come up i be encourage with this and a i have my patron ancient on board i make a waft of it to them for a signal of distress and fire a gun both which they saw for they tell me they saw the smoke though they do not hear the gun upon these signal they very kindly bring to and lay by for me and in about three hour time i come up with them they ask me what i be in portuguese and in spanish and in french but i understand none of them but at last a scot sailor who be on board call to me and i answer him and tell him i be an englishman that i have make my escape out of slavery from the moor at sallee then they have me come on board and very kindly take me in and all my good it be an inexpressible joy to me that any one would believe that i be thus deliver a i esteem it from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition a i be in and immediately offer all i have to the captain of the ship a a return for my deliverance but he generously tell me he would take nothing from me but that all i have should be deliver safe to me when i come to the brasil for say he i have save your life on no other term than i would be glad to be save myself and it may one time or other be my lot to be take up in the same condition besides say he when i carry you to the brasil so great a way from your own country if i should take from you what you have you will be starve there and then i only take away that life i have give no no seignor inglese say he mr englishman i will carry you thither in charity and those thing will help you to buy your subsistence there and your passage home again a he be charitable in hi proposal so he be just in the performance to a tittle for he order the seaman that none should offer to touch any thing i have then he take every thing into hi own possession and give me back an exact inventory of them that i might have them even so much a my three earthen jar a to my boat it be a very good one and that he saw and tell me he would buy it of me for the ship use and ask me what i would have for it i tell him he have be so generous to me in everything that i could not offer to make any price of the boat but leave it entirely to him upon which he tell me he would give me a note of hi hand to pay me eighty piece of eight for it at brasil and when it come there if any one offer to give more he would make it up he offer me also sixty piece of eight more for my boy xury which i be loath to lake not that i be not willing to let the captain have him but i be very loath to sell the poor boy liberty who have assist me so faithfully in procure my own however when i let him know my reason he own it to be just and offer me this medium that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten year if he turn christian upon this and xury say he be willing to go to him i let the captain have him we have a very good voyage to the brasil and arrive in the bay de todos los santos or all saint bay in about twentytwo day after and now i be once more deliver from the most miserable of all condition of life and what to do next with myself i be now to consider the generous treatment the captain give me i can never enough remember he would take nothing of me for my passage give me twenty ducat for the leopard skin and forty for the lion skin which i have in my boat and cause every thing i have in the ship to be punctually deliver me and what i be willing to sell he buy such a the case of bottle two of my gun and a piece of the lump of beeswax for i have make candle of the rest in a word i make about two hundred and twenty piece of eight of all my cargo and with this stock i go on shore in the brasil i have not be long here but be recommend to the house of a good honest man like himself who have an ingeino a they call it that be a plantation and a sugarhouse i live with him some time and acquaint myself by that mean with the manner of their planting and making of sugar and see how well the planter live and how they grow rich suddenly i resolve if i could get license to settle there i would turn planter among them resolve in the mean time to find out some way to get my money which i have leave in london remit to me to this purpose get a kind of a letter of naturalization i purchase as much land that be uncured a my money would reach and form a plan for my plantation and settlement and such a one a might be suitable to the stock which i propose to myself to receive from england i have a neighbour a portuguese of lisbon but bear of english parent whose name be well and in much such circumstance a i be i call him neighbour because hi plantation lay next to mine and we go on very sociable together my stock be but low as well a hi and we rather plant for food than any thing els for about two year however we begin to increase and our land begin to come into order so that the third year we plant some tobacco and make each of u a large piece of ground ready for plant cane in the year to come but we both want help and now i find more than before i have do wrong in part with my boy xury but ala for me to do wrong that never do right be no great wonder i have no remedy but to go on i be get into an employment quite remote to my genius and directly contrary to the life i delight in and for which i forsake my father house and break through all hi good advice nay i be come into the very middle station or upper degree of low life which my father advise me to before and which if i resolve to go on with i might as well have staid at home and never have fatigue myself in the world a i have do and i use often to say to myself i could have do this as well in england among my friend a have go five thousand mile off to do it among stranger and savage in a wilderness and at such distance a never to hear from any part of the world that have the least knowledge of me in this manner i use to look upon my condition with the utmost regret i have nobody to converse with but now and then this neighbour no work to be do but by the labour of my hand and i use to say i live just like a man cast away upon some desolate island that have nobody there but himself but how just have it be and how should all men reflect that when they compare their present condition with other that be bad heaven may oblige them to make the exchange and be convince of their former felicity by their experience i say how just have it be that the truly solitary life i reflect on in an island of mere desolation should be my lot who have so often unjustly compare it with the life which i then lead in which have i continue i have in all probability be exceed prosperous and rich i be in some degree settle in my measure for carry on the plantation before my kind friend the captain of the ship that take me up at sea go back for the ship remain there in provide hi loading and prepare for hi voyage near three month when tell him what little stock i have leave behind me in london he give me this friendly and sincere advice seignor inglese say he for so he always call me if you will give me letter and a procuration here in form to me with order to the person who have your money in london to send your effect to lisbon to such person a i shall direct and in such good a be proper for this country i will bring you the produce of them god willing at my return but since human affair be all subject to change and disaster i would have you give order but for one hundred pound sterling which you say be half your stock and let the hazard be run for the first so that if it come safe you may order the rest the same way and if it miscarry you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply this be so wholesome advice and look so friendly that i could not but be convince it be the best course i could take so i accordingly prepare letter to the gentlewoman with whom i have leave my money and a procuration to the portuguese captain a he desire i write the english captain widow a full account of all my adventure my slavery escape and how i have meet with the portugal captain at sea the humanity of hi behaviour and what condition i be now in with all other necessary direction for my supply and when this honest captain come to lisbon he find mean by some of the english merchant there to send over not the order only but a full account of my story to a merchant at london who represent it effectually to her whereupon she not only deliver the money but out of her own pocket send the portugal captain a very handsome present for hi humanity and charity to me the merchant in london vest this hundred pound in english good such a the captain have writ for send them directly to him at lisbon and he bring them all safe to me to the brasil among which without my direction for i be too young in my business to think of them he have take care to have all sort of tool iron work and utensils necessary for my plantation and which be of great use to me when this cargo arrive i think my fortune make for i be surprise with joy of it and my good steward the captain have lay out the five pound which my friend have send him for a present for himself to purchase and bring me over a servant under bond for six year service and would not accept of any consideration except a little tobacco which i would have him accept be of my own produce neither be this all but my good be all english manufacture such a cloth stuff baize and thing particularly valuable and desirable in the country i find mean to sell them to a very great advantage so that i may say i have more than four time the value of my first cargo and be now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour i mean in the advancement of my plantation for the first thing i do i buy me a negro slave and an european servant also i mean another besides that which the captain bring me from lisbon but a abused prosperity be oftentimes make the very mean of our great adversity so be it with me i go on the next year with great success in my plantation i raise fifty great roll of tobacco on my own ground more than i have dispose of for necessary among my neighbour and these fifty roll be each of above a hundred weight be well cure and lay by against the return of the fleet from lisbon and now increase in business and in wealth my head begin to be full of project and undertaking beyond my reach such a be indeed often the ruin of the best head in business have i continue in the station i be now in i have room for all the happy thing to have yet befall me for which my father so earnestly recommend a quiet retired life and of which he have so sensibly describe the middle station of life to be full but other thing attend me and i be still to be the wilful agent of all my own misery and particularly to increase my fault and double the reflection upon myself which in my future sorrow i should have leisure to make all these miscarriage be procure by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander abroad and pursue that inclination in contradiction to the clear view of do myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospect and those measure of life which nature and providence concur to present me with and to make my duty a i have do thus in my break away from my parent so i could not be content now but i must go and leave the happy view i have of be a rich and thrive man in my new plantation only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rise faster than the nature of the thing admit and thus i cast myself down again into the deep gulf of human misery that ever man fell into or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world to come then by just degree to the particular of this part of my story you may suppose that have now live almost four year in the brasil and begin to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation i have not only learn the language but have contract acquaintance and friendship among my fellowplanters as well a among the merchant at st salvador which be our port and that in my discourse among them i have frequently give them an account of my two voyage to the coast of guinea the manner of trading with the negro there and how easy it be to purchase upon the coast for trifle such a bead toy knife scissars hatchets bit of glass and the like not only golddust guinea grain elephant teeth c but negro for the service of the brasil in great number they listen always very attentively to my discourse on these head but especially to that part which relate to the buying negro which be a trade at that time not only not far enter into but as far a it be have be carry on by the assientos for permission of the king of spain and portugal and engross in the public so that few negro be bring and those excessive dear it happen be in company with some merchant and planter of my acquaintance and talk of those thing very earnestly three of them come to me the next morning and tell me they have be muse very much upon what i have discourse with them of the last night and they come to make a secret proposal to me and after enjoin me secrecy they tell me that they have a mind to fit out a ship to to guinea that they have all plantation as well a i and be straiten for nothing so much a servant that a it be a trade could not be carry on because they could not publicly sell the negro when they come home so they desire to make but one voyage to bring the negro on shore privately and divide them among their own plantation and in a word the question be whether i would go their supercargo in the ship to manage the trading part upon the coast of guinea and they offer me that i should have my equal share of the negro without provide any part of the stock this be a fair proposal it must be confess have it be make to any one that have not have a settlement and plantation of hi own to look after which be in a fair way of come to be very considerable and with a good stock upon it but for me that be thus enter and establish and have nothing to do but go on a i have begin for three or four year more and to have send for the other hundred pound from england and who in that time and with that little addition could scarce have fail of be worth three or four thousand pound sterling and that increase too for me to think of such a voyage be the most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstance could be guilty of but i that be bear to be my own destroyer could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambling design when my father good counsel be lose upon me in a word i tell them i would go with all my heart if they would undertake to look alter my plantation in my absence and would dispose of it to such a i should direct if i miscarry this they all engage to do and enter into writing or covenant to do so and i make a formal will dispose of my plantation and effect in case of my death make the captain of the ship that have save my life a before my universal heir but oblige him to dispose of my effect a i have direct in my will one half of the produce be to himself and the other to be ship to england in short i take all possible caution to preserve my effect and keep up my plantation have i use half a much prudence to have look into my own interest and have make a judgment of what i ought to have do and not to have do i have certainly never go away from so prosperous an undertaking leave all the probable view of a thriving circumstance and go upon a voyage to sea attend with all it common hazard to say nothing of the reason i have to expect particular misfortune to myself but i be hurry on and obey blindly the dictate of my fancy rather than my reason and accordingly the ship be fit out and the cargo furnish and all thing do a by agreement by my partner in the voyage i go on board in an evil hour the st of september be the same day eight year that i go from my father and mother at hull in order to act the rebel to their authority and the fool to my own interest our ship be about one hundred and twenty ton burden carry six gun and fourteen men besides the master hi boy and myself we have on board no large cargo of good except of such toy a be fit for our trade with the negro such a bead bit of glass shell and odd trifle especially little lookingglasses knife scissars hatchet and the like the same day i go on board we set sail stand away to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretch over for the african coast when they come about or degree of northern latitude which it seem be the manner of their course in those day we have very good weather only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast till we make the height of cape st augustino from whence keep farther off at sea we lose sight of land and steer a if we be bind for the isle fernand de noronha hold our course ne by n and leave those isle on the east in this course we pass the line in about twelve day time and be by our last observation in degree min northern latitude when a violent tornado or hurricane take u quite out of our knowledge it begin from the southeast come about to the northwest and then settle into the northeast from whence it blow in such a terrible manner that for twelve day together we could do nothing but drive and scud away before it let it carry u whither ever fate and the fury of the wind direct and during these twelve day i need not say that i expect every day to be swallow up nor indeed do any in the ship expect to save their life in this distress we have besides the terror of the storm one of our men die of the calenture and one man and the boy wash overboard about the twelfth day the weather abate a little the master make an observation as well a he could and find that he be in about degree north latitude but that he be degree of longitude difference west from cape st augustino so that he find he be get upon the coast of guinea or the north part of brasil beyond the river amazon toward that of the river oronoque commonly call the great river and begin to consult with me what course he should take for the ship be leaky and very much disabled and he be go directly back to the coast of brasil i be positively against that and look over the chart of the sea coast of america with him we conclude there be no inhabited country for u to have recourse to till we come within the circle of the caribbee island and therefore resolve to stand away for barbadoes which by keep off at sea to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico we might easily perform a we hop in about fifteen day sail whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves with this design we change our course and steer away nw by w in order to reach some of our english island where i hop for relief but our voyage be otherwise determine for be in the latitude of deg min a second storm come upon u which carry u away with the same impetuosity westward and drive u so out of the very way of all human commerce that have all our life be save a to the sea we be rather in danger of be devour by savage than ever return to our own country in this distress the wind still blow very hard one of our men early in the morning cry out land and we have no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hope of see whereabouts in the world we be but the ship struck upon a sand and in a moment her motion be so stop the sea break over her in such a manner that we expect we should all have perish immediately and we be immediately drive into our close quarter to shelter u from the very foam and spray of the sea it be not easy for any one who have not be in the like condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstance we know nothing where we be or upon what land it be we be drive whether an island or the main whether inhabited or not inhabited and a the rage of the wind be still great though rather less than at first we could not so much a hope to have the ship hold many minute without break in piece unless the wind by a kind of miracle should turn immediately about in a word we sit look one upon another and expect death every moment and every man act accordingly a prepare for another world for there be little or nothing more for u to do in this that which be our present comfort and all the comfort we have be that contrary to our expectation the ship do not break yet and that the master say the wind begin to abate now though we think that the wind do a little abate yet the ship have thus strike upon the sand and stick too fast for u to expect her get off we be in a dreadful condition indeed and have nothing to do but to think of save our life as well a we could we have a boat at our stern just before the storm but she be first stave by dash against the ship rudder and in the next place she break away and either sunk or be drive off to sea so there be no hope from her we have another boat on board but how to get her off into the sea be a doubtful thing however there be no room to debate for we fancy the ship would break in piece every minute and some tell u she be actually break already in this distress the mate of our vessel lay hold of the boat and with the help of the rest of the men they get her slung over the ship side and get all into her let go and committed ourselves be eleven in number to god mercy and the wild sea for though the storm be abate considerably yet the sea go dreadful high upon the shore and might well be call den wild zee a the dutch call the sea in a storm and now our case be very dismal indeed for we all saw plainly that the sea go so high that the boat could not live and that we should be inevitably drown a to make sail we have none nor if we have could we have do any thing with it so we work at the oar towards the land though with heavy heart like men go to execution for we all know that when the boat come nearer the shore she would be dash into a thousand piece by the breach of the sea however we commit our soul to god in the most earnest manner and the wind drive u towards the shore we hasten our destruction with our own hand pull as well a we could towards land what the shore be whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we know not the only hope that could rationally give u the least shadow of expectation be if we might happen into some bay or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chance we might have run our boat in or get under the lee of the land and perhaps make smooth water but there be nothing of this appeared but a we make nearer and nearer the shore the land look more frightful than the sea after we have row or rather drive about a league and a half a we reckon it a rag wave mountainlike come roll astern of u and plainly have u expect the coupdegrace in a word it take u with such a fury that it overset the boat at once and separate u as well from the boat a from one another give u not time hardly to say o god for we be all swallow up in a moment nothing can describe the confusion of thought which i felt when i sink into the water for though i swim very well yet i could not deliver myself from the wave so a to draw breath till that wave have drive me or rather carry me a vast way on towards the shore and have spend itself go back and leave me upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i take in i have so much presence of mind as well a breath leave that see myself nearer the main land than i expect i get upon my foot and endeavour to make on towards the land as fast a i could before another wave should return and take me up again but i soon find it be impossible to avoid it for i saw the sea come after me as high a a great hill and as furious a an enemy which i have no mean or strength to contend with my business be to hold my breath and raise myself upon the water if i could and so by swim to preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards the shore if possible my great concern now be that the sea a it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it come on might not carry me back again with it when it give back towards the sea the wave that come upon me again bury me at once twenty or thirty foot deep in it own body and i could feel myself carry with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way but i hold my breath and assist myself to swim still forward with all my might i be ready to burst with hold my breath when a i felt myself rise up so to my immediate relief i find my head and hand shoot out above the surface of the water and though it be not two second of time that i could keep myself so yet it relieve me greatly give me breath and new courage i be cover again with water a good while but not so long but i hold it out and find the water have spend itself and begin to return i strike forward against the return of the wave and felt ground again with my foot i stand still a few moment to recover breath and till the water go from me and then take to my heel and ran with what strength i have far towards the shore but neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea which come pour in after me again and twice more i be lift up by the wave and carry forward a before the shore be very flat the last time of these two have well near be fatal to me for the sea have hurry me along a before landed me or rather dash me against a piece of a rock and that with such force a it leave me senseless and indeed helpless a to my own deliverance for the blow take my side and breast beat the breath a it be quite out of my body and have it return again immediately i must have be strangle in the water but i recover a little before the return of the wave and see i should be cover again with the water i resolve to hold fast by a piece of the rock and so to hold my breath if possible till the wave go back now a the wave be not so high a at first be near land i hold my hold till the wave abate and then fetch another run which bring me so near the shore that the next wave though it go over me yet do not so swallow me up a to carry me away and the next run i take i get to the main land where to my great comfort i clamber up the clifts of the shore and sit me down upon the grass free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water i be now land and safe on shore and begin to look up and thank god that my life be save in a case wherein there be some minute before scarce any room to hope i believe it be impossible to express to the life what the ecstasy and transport of the soul be when it be so saved a i may say out of the very grave and i do not wonder now at that custom viz that when a malefactor who have the halter about hi neck be tie up and just go to be turn off and have a reprieve bring to him i say i do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it that the surprise may not drive the animal spirit from the heart and overwhelm him for sudden joy like grief confound at first i walk about on the shore lift up my hand and my whole be a i may say wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance make a thousand gesture and motion which i can not describe reflect upon all my comrade that be drown and that there should not be one soul save but myself for a for them i never saw them afterwards or any sign of them except three of their hat one cap and two shoe that be not fellows i cast my eye to the strand vessel when the breach and troth of the sea be so big i could hardly see it it lay so far off and consider lord how be it possible i could get on shore after i have solace my mind with the comfortable part of my condition i begin to look round me to see what kind of place i be in and what be next to be do and i soon find my comfort abate and that in a word i have a dreadful deliverance for i be wet have no clothes to shift me nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me neither do i see any prospect before me but that of perish with hunger or be devour by wild beast and that which be particularly afflict to me be that i have no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs in a word i have nothing about me but a knife a tobacco pipe and a little tobacco in a box this be all my provision and this throw me into terrible agony of mind that for a while i run about like a madman night come upon me i begin with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there be any ravenous beast in that country see at night they always come abroad for their prey all the remedy that offer to my thought at that time be to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir but thorny which grow near me and where i resolve to sit all night and consider the next day what death i should die for a yet i saw no prospect of life i walk about a furlong from the shore to see if i could find any fresh water to drink which i do to my great joy and have drank and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger i go to the tree and get up into it endeavour to place myself so a that if i should sleep i might not fall and have cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my defence i take up my lodging and have be excessively fatigue i fell fast asleep and sleep as comfortably a i believe few could have do in my condition and find myself the most refreshed with it that i think i ever be on such an occasion when i wake it be broad day the weather clear and the storm abate so that the sea do not rage and swell a before but that which surprise me most be that the ship be lift off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide and be drive up almost as far a the rock which i first mention where i have be so bruise by the dash me against it this be within about a mile from the shore where i be and the ship seem to stand upright still i wish myself on board that at least i might save some necessary thing for my use when i come down from my apartment in the tree i look about me again and the first thing i find be the boat which lay a the wind and the sea have toss her up upon the land about two mile on my right hand i walk as far a i could upon the shore to have get to her but find a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which be about half a mile broad so i come back for the present be more intent upon get at the ship where i hop to find something for my present subsistence a little after noon i find the sea very calm and the tide ebb so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship and here i find a fresh renewing of my grief for i saw evidently that if we have keep on board we have be all safe that be to say we have all get safe on shore and i have not be so miserable a to be leave entirely destitute of all comfort and company a i now be this forced tear from my eye again but a there be little relief in that i resolve if possible to get to the ship so i pull off my clothes for the weather be hot to extremity and take the water but when i come to the ship my difficulty be still great to know how to get on board for a she lay aground and high out of the water there be nothing within my reach to lay hold of i swim round her twice and the second time i spy a small piece of a rope which i wonder i do not see at first hang down by the forechains so low a that with great difficulty i get hold of it and by the help of that rope get up into the forecastle of the ship here i find that the ship be bulge and have a great deal of water in her hold but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand or rather earth and her stern lay lift up upon the bank and her head low almost to the water by this mean all her quarter be free and all that be in that part be dry for you may be sure my first work be to search and to see what be spoil and what be free and first i find that all the ship provision be dry and untouched by the water and be very well dispose to eat i go to the breadroom and fill my pocket with bisket and eat it a i go about other thing for i have no time to lose i also find some rum in the great cabin of which i take a large drain and which i have indeed need enough of to spirit me for what be before me now i want nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many thing which i foresee would be very necessary to me it be in vain to sit still and wish for what be not to be have and this extremity rouse my application we have several spare yard and two or three large spar of wood and a spare topmast or two in the ship i resolve to fall to work with these and fling a many of them overboard a i could manage of their weight tie every one with a rope that they might not drive away when this be do i go down the ships side and pull them to me i tie four of them fast together at both end as well a i could in the form of a raft and lay two or three short piece of plank upon them crossways i find i could walk upon it very well but that it be not able to bear any great weight the piece be too light so i go to work and with the carpenter saw i cut a spare topmast into three length and add them to my raft with a great deal of labour and pain but hope of furnish myself with necessary encourage me to go beyond what i should have be able to have do upon another occasion my raft be now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight my next care be what to load it with and how to preserve what i lay upon it from the surf of the sea but i be not long consider this i first lay all the plank or board upon it that i could get and have consider well what i most want i first get three of the seaman chest which i have break open and emptied and lower them down upon my raft the first of these i fill with provision viz bread rice three dutch cheese five piece of dried goat flesh which we live much upon and a little remainder of european corn which have be lay by for some fowl which we bring to sea with u but the fowl be kill there have be some barley and wheat together but to my great disappointment i find afterwards that the rat have eat or spoil it all a for liquor i find several case of bottle belong to our skipper in which be some cordial water and in all above five or six gallon of rack these i stow by themselves there be no need to put them into the chest nor no room for them while i be do this i find the tide begin to flow though very calm and i have the mortification to see my coat shirt and waistcoat which i have leave on shore upon the sand swim away a for my breech which be only linen and openkneed i swim on board in them and my stocking however this put me upon rummage for clothes of which i find enough but take no more than i want for present use for i have other thing which my eye be more upon a first tool to work with on shore and it be after long search that i find out the carpenter chest which be indeed a very useful prize to me and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have be at that time i get it down to my raft even whole a it be without lose time to look into it for i know in general what it contain my next care be for some ammunition and arm there be two very good fowlingpieces in the great cabin and two pistol these i secure first with some powder horn and a small bag of shot and two old rusty sword i know there be three barrel of powder in the ship but know not where our gunner have stow them but with much search i find them two of them dry and good the third have take water those two i get to my raft with the arm and now i think myself pretty well freight and begin to think how i should get to shore with them have neither sail oar or rudder and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation i have three encouragement a smooth calm sea the tide rising and set in to the shore what little wind there be blew me towards the land and thus have find two or three broken oar belong to the boat and besides the tool which be in the chest i find two saw an axe and a hammer and with this cargo i put to sea for a mile or thereabouts my raft go very well only that i find it drive a little distant from the place where i have land before by which i perceive that there be some indraft of the water and consequently i hop to find some creek or river there which i might make use of a a port to get to land with my cargo a i imagine so it be there appear before me a little opening of the land and i find a strong current of the tide set into it so i guide my raft as well a i could to keep in the middle of the stream but here i have like to have suffer a second shipwreck which if i have i think verily would have break my heart for know nothing of the coast my raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal and not be aground at the other end it want but a little that all my cargo have slip off towards that end that be afloat and so fall into the water i do my utmost by set my back against the chest to keep them in their place but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength neither durst i stir from the posture i be in but hold up the chest with all my might stand in that manner near half an hour in which time the rising of the water bring me a little more upon a level and a little after the water still rise my raft float again and i thrust her off with the oar i have into the channel and then drive up high i at length find myself in the mouth of a little river with land on both side and a strong current or tide run up i look on both side for a proper place to get to shore for i be not willing to be drive too high up the river hop in time to see some ship at sea and therefore resolve to place myself a near the coast a i could at length i spy a little cove on the right shore of the creek to which with great pain and difficulty i guide my raft and at last get so near a that reach ground with my oar i could thrust her directly in but here i have like to have dip all my cargo in the sea again for that shore lie pretty steep that be to say slop there be no place to land but where one end of the float if it run on shore would lie so high and the other sink lower a before that it would endanger my cargo again all that i could do be to wait till the tide be at the high keep the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore near a flat piece of ground which i expect the water would flow over and so it do as soon a i find water enough for my raft draw about a foot of water i thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground and there fasten or moor her by stick my two broken oar into the ground one on one side near one end and one on the other side near the other end and thus i lay till the water ebb away and leave my raft and all my cargo safe on shore my next work be to view the country and seek a proper place for my habitation and where to stow my good to secure them from whatever might happen where i be i yet know not whether on the continent or on an island whether inhabit or not inhabited whether in danger of wild beast or not there be a hill not above a mile from me which rise up very steep and high and which seem to overtop some other hill which lay a in a ridge from it northward i take out one of the fowlingpieces and one of the pistol and an horn of powder and thus arm i travel for discovery up to the top of that hill where after i have with great labour and difficulty get to the top i saw my fate to my great affliction viz that i be in an island environ every way with the sea no land to be see except some rock which lay a great way off and two small island less than this which lay about three league to the west i find also that the island i be in be barren and a i saw good reason to believe uninhabited except by wild beast of whom however i saw none yet i saw abundance of fowl but know not their kind neither when i kill them could i tell what be fit for food and what not at my come back i shoot at a great bird which i saw sit upon a tree on the side of a great woodi believe it be the first gun that have be fire there since the creation of the world i have no sooner fire but from all part of the wood there arise an innumerable number of fowl of many sort make a confused screaming and cry every one accord to hi usual note but not one of them of any kind that i know a for the creature i kill i take it to be a kind of a hawk it colour and beak resemble it but have no talon or claw more than common it flesh be carrion and fit for nothing content with this discovery i come back to my raft and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore which take me up the rest of that day and what to do with myself at night i know not nor indeed where to rest for i be afraid to lie down on the ground not know but some wild beast might devour me though a i afterwards find there be really no need for those fear however as well a i could i barricado myself round with the chest and board that i have bring on shore and make a kind of a hut for that night lodging a for food i yet saw not which way to supply myself except that i have see two or three creature like hare run out of the wood where i shoot the fowl i now begin to consider that i might yet get a great many thing out of the ship which would be useful to me and particularly some of the rigging and sail and such other thing a might come to land and i resolve to make another voyage on board the vessel if possible and a i know that the first storm that blow must necessarily break her all in piece i resolve to set all other thing apart till i get every thing out of the ship that i could get then i call a council that be to say in my thought whether i should take back the raft but this appear impracticable so i resolve to go a before when the tide be down and i do so only that i strip before i go from my hut have nothing on but a checked shirt and a pair of linen trowsers and a pair of pump on my foot i get on board the ship a before and prepare a second raft and have have experience of the first i neither make this so unwieldy nor load it so hard but yet i bring away several thing very useful to me a first in the carpenter store i find two or three bag full of nail and spike a great screwjack a dozen or two of hatchet and above all that most useful thing call a grindstone all these i secure together with several thing belong to the gunner particularly two or three iron crow and two barrel of musketbullets seven musket and another fowlingpiece with some small quantity of powder more a large bag full of small shot and a great roll of sheet lead but this last be so heavy i could not hoist it up to get it over the ship side besides these thing i take all the men clothes that i could find and a spare foretopsail hammock and some bedding and with this i load my second raft and bring them all safe on shore to my very great comfort i be under some apprehension during my absence from the land that at least my provision might be devour on shore but when i come back i find no sign of any visitor only there sit a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chest which when i come towards it run away a little distance and then stand still she sit very composed and unconcerned and look full in my face a if she have a mind to be acquaint with me i present my gun at her but a she do not understand it she be perfectly unconcerned at it nor do she offer to stir away upon which i toss her a bit of biscuit though by the way i be not very free of it for my store be not great however i spar her a bit i say and she go to it smell of it and eat it and look a pleased for more but i thank her and could spare no more so she march off have get my second cargo on shore though i be fain to open the barrel of powder and bring them by parcel for they be too heavy be large cask i go to work to make me a little tent with the sail and some pole which i cut for that purpose and into this tent i bring every thing that i know would spoil either with rain or sun and i pile all the empty chest and casks up in a circle round the tent to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man or beast when i have do this i block up the door of the tent with some board within and an empty chest set up an end without and spread one of the bed upon the ground lay my two pistol just at my head and my gun at length by me i go to bed for the first time and sleep very quietly all night for i be very weary and heavy a the night before i have sleep little and have labour very hard all day as well to fetch all those thing from the ship a to get them on shore i have the big magazine of all kind now that ever be lay up i believe for one man but i be not satisfy still for while the ship sit upright in that posture i think i ought to get every thing out of her that i could so every day at low water i go on board and bring away something or other but particularly the third time i go i bring away a much of the rigging a i could a also all the small rope and ropetwine i could get with a piece of spare canvas which be to mend the sail upon occasion and the barrel of wet gunpowder in a word i bring away all the sail first and last only that i be fain to cut them in piece and bring as much at a time a i could for they be no more useful to be sail but a mere canvas only but that which comfort me more still be that at last of all after i have make five or six such voyage a these and think i have nothing more to expect from the ship that be worth my meddle with i say after all this i find a great hogshead of bread and three large runlets of rum or spirit and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine flower this be surprise to me because i have give over expect any more provision except what be spoil by the water i soon empty the hogshead of that bread and wrap it up parcel by parcel in piece of the sail which i cut out and in a word i get all this safe on shore also the next day i make another voyage and now have plunder the ship of what be portable and fit to hand out i begin with the cable and cut the great cable into piece such a i could move i get two cable and a hawser on shore with all the ironwork i could get and have cut down the spritsailyard and the mizenyard and every thing i could to make a large raft i load it with all those heavy good and come away but my good luck begin now to leave me for this raft be so unwieldy and so overladen that after i have enter the little cove where i have land the rest of my good not be able to guide it so handily a i do the other it overset and throw me and all my cargo into the water a for myself it be no great harm for i be near the shore but a to my cargo it be great part of it lose especially the iron which i expect would have be of great use to me however when the tide be out i get most of the piece of cable ashore and some of the iron though with infinitelabour for i be fain to dip for it into the water a work which fatigue me very much after this i go every day on board and bring away what i could get i have be now thirteen day on shore and have be eleven time on board the ship in which time i have bring away all that one pair of hand could well be suppose capable to bring though i believe verily have the calm weather hold i should have bring away the whole ship piece by piece but prepare the twelfth time to go on board i find the wind begin to rise however at low water i go on board and though i think i have rummage the cabin so effectually a that nothing more could be find yet i discover a locker with drawer in it in one of which i find two or three razor and one pair of large scissars with some ten or a dozen of good knife and fork in another i find about thirtysix pound value in money some european coin some brasil some piece of eight some gold some silver i smile to myself at the sight of this money o drug say i aloud what art thou good for thou art not worth to me no not the take off of the ground one of those knife be worth all this heap i have no manner of use for thee even remain where thou art and go to the bottom a a creature whose life be not worth save however upon second thought i take it away and wrap all this in a piece of canvas i begin to think of make another raft but while i be prepare this i find the sky overcast and the wind begin to rise and in a quarter of an hour it blow a fresh gale from the shore it presently occur to me that it be in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore and that it be my business to be go before the tide of flood begin otherwise i might not be able to reach the shore at all accordingly i let myself down into the water and swam cross the channel which lay between the ship and the sand and even that with difficulty enough partly with the weight of thing i have about me and partly the roughness of the water for the wind rise very hastily and before it be quite high water it blow a storm but i be get home to my little tent where i lay with all my wealth about me very secure it blew very hard all that night and in the morning when i look out behold no more ship be to be see i be a little surprised but recover myself with this satisfactory reflection viz that i have lose no time nor abated no diligence to get every thing out of her that could be useful to me and that indeed there be little left in her that i be able to bring away if i have have more time i now give over any more thought of the ship or of any thing out of her except what might drive on shore from her wreck a indeed diver piece of her afterwards do but those thing be of small use to me my thought be now wholly employ about secure myself against either savage if any should appear or wild beast if any be in the island and i have many thought of the method how to do this and what kind of dwell to make whether i should make me a cave in the earth or a tent upon the earth and in short i resolve upon both the manner and description of which it may not be improper to give an account of i soon find the place i be in be not for my settlement particularly because it be upon a low moorish ground near the sea and i believe would not be wholesome and more particularly because there be no fresh water near it so i resolve to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground i consult several thing in my situation which i find would be proper for me st health and fresh water i just now mention dly shelter from the heat of the sun dly security from ravenous creature whether man or beast thly a view to the sea that if god send any ship in sight i might not lose any advantage for my deliverance of which i be not willing to banish all my expectation yet in search of a place proper for this i find a little plain on the side of a rise hill whose front towards this little plain be steep a a houseside so that nothing could come down upon me from the top on the side of this rock there be a hollow place wear a little way in like the entrance or door of a cave but there be not really any cave or way into the rock at all on the flat of the green just before this hollow place i resolve to pitch my tent this plain be not above an hundred yard broad and about twice a long and lay like a green before my door and at the end of it descend irregularly every way down into the low ground by the seaside it be on the nnw side of the hill so that i be shelter from the heat every day till it come to a w and by s sun or thereabouts which in those country be near the setting before i set up my tent i draw a halfcircle before the hollow place which take in about ten yard in it semidiameter from the rock and twenty yard in it diameter from it beginning and end in this half circle i pitch two row of strong stake drive them into the ground till they stand very firm like pile the big end be out of the ground about five foot and a half and sharpen on the top the two row do not stand above six inch from one another then i take the piece of cable which i have cut in the ship and lay them in row one upon another within the circle between these two row of stake up to the top placing other stake in the inside lean against them about two foot and a half high like a spur to a post and this fence be so strong that neither man or beast could get into it or over it this cost me a great deal of time and labour especially to cut the pile in the wood bring them to the place and drive them into the earth the entrance into this place i make to be not by a door but by a short ladder to go over the top which ladder when i be in i lift over after me and so i be completely fence in and fortify a i think from all the world and consequently slept secure in the night which otherwise i could not have do though a it appear afterward there be no need of all this caution from the enemy that i apprehend danger from into this fence or fortress with infinitelabour i carry all my rich all my provision ammunition and store of which you have the account above and i make me a large tent which to preserve me from the rain that in one part of the year be very violent there i make double viz one small tent within and one large tent above it and cover the uppermost with a large tarpaulin which i have save among the sail and now i lay no more for awhile in the bed which i have bring on shore but in a hammock which be indeed a very good one and belong to the mate of the ship into this tent i bring all my provision and every thing that would spoil by the wet and have thus enclose all my good i make up the entrance which till now i have leave open and so passed and repassed a i say by a short ladder when i have do this i begin to work my way into the rock and bring all the earth and stone that i dig down out through my tent i lay them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace that so it raise the ground within about a foot and a half and thus i make me a cave just behind my tent which serve me like a cellar to my house it cost me much labour and many day before all these thing be bring to perfection and therefore i must go back to some other thing which take up some of my thought at the same time it happen after i have lay my scheme for the set up my tent and make the cave that a storm of rain fall from a thick dark cloud a sudden flash of lightning happen and after that a great clap of thunder a be naturally the effect of it i be not so much surprise with the lightning a i be with a thought which dart into my mind as swift a the lightning itself o my powder my very heart sunk within me when i think that at one blast all my powder might be destroy on which not my defence only but the provide me food a i think entirely depend i be nothing near so anxious about my own danger though have the powder take fire i have never know who have hurt me such impression do this make upon me that after the storm be over i lay aside all my work my building and fortifying and apply myself to make bag and box to separate the powder and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel in hope that whatever might come it might not all take fire at once and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another i finish this work in about a fortnight and i think my powder which in all be about two hundred and forty pound weight be divide in not less than a hundred parcel a to the barrel that have be wet i do not apprehend any danger from that so i place it in my new cave which in my fancy i call my kitchen and the rest i hide up and down in hole among the rock so that no wet might come to it mark very carefully where i lay it in the interval of time while this be do i go out once at least every day with my gun as well to divert myself a to see if i could kill any thing fit for food and as near a i could to acquaint myself with what the island produce the first time i go out i presently discover that there be goat in the island which be a great satisfaction to me but then it be attend with this misfortune to me viz that they be so shy so subtle and so swift of foot that it be the most difficult thing in the world to come at them but i be not discourage at this not doubt but i might now and then shoot one a it soon happen for after i have find their haunt a little i lay wait in this manner for them i observe if they saw me in the vallies though they be upon the rock they would run away a in a terrible fright but if they be feed in the vallies and i be upon the rock they take no notice of me from whence i conclude that by the position of their optic their sight be so directed downward that they do not readily see object that be above them so afterward i take this method i always climb the rock first to get above them and then have frequently a fair mark the first shot i make among these creature kill a shegoat which have a little kid by her which she give suck to which grieve me heartily but when the old one fell the kid stand stock still by her till i come and take her up and not only so but when i carry the old one with me upon my shoulder the kid follow me quite to my enclosure upon which i lay down the dam and take the kid in my arm and carry it over my pale in hope to have breed it up tame but it would not eat so i be force to kill it and eat it myself these two supply me with flesh a great while for i eat sparingly and save my provision my bread especially as much a possibly i could have now fix my habitation i find it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in and fuel to burn and what i do for that a also how i enlarge my cave and what conveniencies i make i shall give a full account of in it place but i must first give some little account of myself and of my thought about living which it may well be suppose be not a few i have a dismal prospect of my condition for a i be not cast away upon that island without be drive a be say by a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage and a great way viz some hundred of league out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind i have great reason to consider it a a determination of heaven that in this desolate place and in this desolate manner i should end my life the tear would run plentifully down my face when i make these reflection and sometimes i would expostulate with myself why providence should thus completely ruin hi creature and render them so absolutely miserable so without help abandon so entirely depressed that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life but something always return swift upon me to check these thought and to reprove me and particularly one day walk with my gun in my hand by the seaside i be very pensive upon the subject of my present condition when reason a it be expostulate with the tother way thus well you be in a desolate condition ti true but pray remember where be the rest of you did not you come eleven of you into the boat where be the ten why be they not save and you lose why be you single out be it good to be here or there and then i point to the sea all evil be to be consider with the good that be in them and with what bad attend them then it occur to me again how well i be furnish for my subsistence and what would have be my ease if it have not happen which be an hundred thousand to one that the ship float from the place where she first strike and be drive so near the shore that i have time to get all these thing out of her what would have be my case if i have be to have live in the condition in which i at first come on shore without necessary of life or necessary to supply and procure them particularly say i loud though to myself what should i have do without a gun without ammunition without any tool to make any thing or to work with without clothes bed a tent or any manner of cover and that now i have all these to a sufficient quantity and be in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner a to live without my gun when my ammunition be spend so that i have a tolerable view of subsist without any want as long a i live for i consider from the begin how i should provide for the accident that might happen and for the time that be to come even not only after my ammunition should be spend but even after my health or strength should decay i confess i have not entertain any notion of my ammunition be destroy at one blast i mean my powder be blow up by lightning and this make the thought of it so surprising to me when it lightned and thunder a i observe just now and now be about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life such perhaps a be never hear of in the world before i shall take it from it beginning and continue it in it order it be by my account the th of september when in the manner a above say i first set foot upon this horrid island when the sun be to u in it autumnal equinox be almost just over my head for i reckon myself by observation to be in the latitude of degree minute north of the line after i have be there about ten or twelve day it come into my thought that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of book and pen and ink and should even forget the sabbath day from the working day but to prevent this i cut it with my knife upon a large post in capital letter and make it into a great cross i set it up on the shore where i first land viz i come on shore here on the th of september upon the side of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife and every seventh notch be a long again a the rest and every first day of the month a long again a that long one and thus i keep my calendar or weekly monthly and yearly reckoning of time in the next place we be to observe that among the many thing which i bring out of the ship in the several voyage which a above mention i make to it i get several thing of less value but not all less useful to me which i omit set down before a in particular pen ink and paper several parcel in the captain mat gunner and carpenter keep three or four compass some mathematical instrument dial perspective chart and book of navigation all which i huddle together whether i might want them or no also i find three very good bible which come to me in my cargo from england and which i have pack up among my thing some portuguese book also and among them two or three popish prayerbook and several other book all which i carefully secure and i must not forget that we have in the ship a dog and two cat of whose eminent history i may have occasion to say something in it place for i carry both the cat with me and a for the dog he jump out of the ship of himself and swim on shore to me the day after i go on shore with my first cargo and be a trusty servant to me many year i want nothing that he could fetch me nor any company that he could make up to me i only want to have him talk to me but that he could not do a i observe before i find pen ink and paper and i husband them to the utmost and i shall shew that while my ink last i keep thing very exact but after that be go i could not for i could not make any ink by any mean that i could devise and this put me in mind that i want many thing notwithstanding all that i have amass together and of these this of ink be one a also spade pickaxe and shovel to dig or remove the earth needle pin and thread a for linen i soon learn to want that without much difficulty this want of tool make every work i do go on heavily and it be near a whole year before i have entirely finish my little pale or surround habitation the pile or stake which be as heavy a i could well lift be a long time in cut and prepare in the wood and more by far in bring home so that i spend sometimes two day in cut and bring home one of those post and a third day in drive it into the ground for which purpose i get a heavy piece of wood at first but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crow which however though i find it yet it make drive those post or pile very laborious and tedious work but what need i have be concern at the tediousness of any thing i have to do see i have time enough to do it in nor have i any other employment if that have be over at least that i could foresee except the range the island to seek for food which i do more or less every day i now begin to consider seriously my condition and the circumstance i be reduce to and i draw up the state of my affair in write not so much to leave them to any that be to come after me for i be like to have but few heir a to deliver my thought from daily pore upon them and afflict my mind and a my reason begin now to master my despondency i begin to comfort myself as well a i could and to set the good against the evil that i might have something to distinguish my case from bad and i state it very impartially like debtor and creditor the comfort i enjoy against the misery i suffer thus evilgood i be cast upon a horrible but i be alive and desolate island void not drown a all my of all hope of recovery ship company be i be single out and but i be single out separate a it be too from all the ship from all the world to be crew to be spar from miserable death and he that miraculously save me from death can deliver me from this condition i be divide from but i be not starve mankind a solitaire one and perish on a barren banish from human society place afford no sustenance i have not clothes to but i be in a hot climate cover me where if i have clothes i could hardly wear them i be without any defence but i be cast on an or mean to resist island where i see no any violence of man or wild beast to hurt me beast a i saw on the coast of africa and what if i have be shipwreck there i have no soul to speak but god wonderfully to or relieve me send the ship in near enough to the shore that i have get out so many necessary thing a will either supply my want or enable me to supply myself even as long a i live upon the whole here be an undoubted testimony that there be scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there be something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it and let this stand a a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all condition in this world that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from and to set in the description of good and evil on the credit side of the account having now bring my mind a little to relish my condition and give over look out to sea to see if i could spy a ship i say give over these thing i begin to apply myself to accommodate my way of living and to make thing a easy to me a i could i have already describe my habitation which be a tent under the side of a rock surround with a strong pale of post and cable but i might now rather call it a wall for i raise a kind of wall up against it of turf about two foot thick on the outside and after some time i think it be a year and half i raise rafter from it lean to the rock and thatch or cover it with bough of tree and such thing a i could get to keep out the rain which i find at some time of the year very violent i have already observe how i bring all my good into this pale and into the cave which i have make behind me but i must observe too that at first this be a confused heap of good which a they lay in no order so they take up all my place i have no room to turn myself so i set myself to enlarge my cave and work far into the earth for it be a loose sandy rock which yield easily to the labour i bestow on it and so when i find i be pretty safe a to beast of prey i work sideways to the right hand into the rock and then turn to the right again work quite out and make me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification this give me not only egress and regress a it be a backway to my tent and to my storehouse but give me room to stow my good and now i begin to apply myself to make such necessary thing a i find i most want particularly a chair and a table for without these i be not able to enjoy the few comfort i have in the world i could not write or eat or do several thing with so much pleasure without a table so i go to work and here i must need observe that a reason be the substance and original of the mathematics so by state and square every thing by reason and by make the most rational judgment of thing every man may be in time master of every mechanic art i have never handle a tool in my life and yet in time by labour application and contrivance i find at last that i want nothing but i could have make it especially if i have have tool however i make abundance of thing even without tool and some with no more tool than an adze and a hatchet which perhaps be never make that way before and that with infinitelabour for example if i want a board i have no other way but to cut down a tree set it on an edge before me and hew it flat on either side with my axe till i have bring it to be as thin a a plank and then dub it smooth with my adze it be true by this method i could make but one board out of a whole tree but this i have no remedy for but patience any more than i have for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it take me up to make a plank or board but my time or labour be little worth and so it be as well employ one way a another however i make me a table and a chair a i observe above in the first place and this i do out of the short piece of board that i bring on my raft from the ship but when i have work out some board a above i make large shelf of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another all along one side of my cave to lay all my tool nail and ironwork and in a word to separate every thing at large in their place that i might come easily at them i knock piece into the wall of the rock to hang my gun and all thing that would hang up so that have my cave be to be see it look like a general magazine of all necessary thing and i have every thing so ready at my hand that it be a great pleasure to me to see all my good in such order and especially to find my stock of all necessary so great and now it be that i begin to keep a journal of every day employment for indeed at first i be in too much a hurry and not only hurry a to labour but in too much discomposure of mind and my journal would have be full of many dull thing for example i must have say thus sept the th after i get to shore and have escape drown instead of be thankful to god for my deliverance have first vomit with the great quantity of salt water which be get into my stomach and recover myself a little i run about the shore wring my hand and beat my head and face exclaiming at my misery and cry out i be undone undone till tire and faint i be force to lie down on the ground to repose but durst not sleep for fear of be devour some day after this and after i have be on board the ship and get all that i could out of her yet i could not forbear get up to the top of a little mountain and look out to sea in hope of see a ship then fancy at a vast distance i spy a sail please myself with the hope of it and then after look steadily till i be almost blind lose it quite and sit down and weep like a child and thus increase my misery by my folly but have get over these thing in some measure and have settle my householdstuff and habitation make me a table and a chair and all a handsome about me a i could i begin to keep my journal of which i shall here give you the copy though in it will be tell all those particular over again as long a it last for have no more ink i be force to leave it off thejournal september i poor miserable robinson crusoe be shipwreck during a dreadful storm in the offing come on shore on this dismal unfortunate island which i call the island of despair all the rest of the ship company be drown and myself almost dead all the rest of that day i spend in afflict myself at the dismal circumstance i be bring to viz i have neither food house clothe weapon or place to fly to and in despair of any relief saw nothing but death before me either that i should be devour by wild beast murder by savage or starve to death for want of food at the approach of night i sleep in a tree for fear of wild creature but sleep soundly though it rain all night october in the morning i saw to my great surprise the ship have float with the high tide and be drive on shore again much nearer the island which a it be some comfort on one hand for see her sit upright and not break to piece i hop if the wind abate i might get on board and get some food and necessary out of her for my relief so on the other hand it renew my grief at the loss of my comrade who i imagine if we have all staid on board might have save the ship or at least that they would not have be all drown a they be and that have the men be save we might perhaps have build u a boat out of the ruin of the ship to have carry u to some other part of the world i spend great part of this day in perplex myself on these thing but at length see the ship almost dry i go upon the sand as near a i could and then swim on board this day also it continue rain though with no wind at all from the st of october to the th all these day entirely spend in many several voyage to get all i could out of the ship which i bring on shore every tide of flood upon raft much rain also in these day though with some interval of fair weather but it seem this be the rainy season i overset my raft and all the good i have get up upon it but be in shoal water and the thing be chiefly heavy i recover many of them when the tide be out it rain all night and all day with some gust of wind during which time the ship break in piece the wind blow a little hard than before and be no more to be see except the wreck of her and that only at low water i spend this day in cover and secure the good which i have save that rain might not spoil them i walk about the shore almost all day to find out a place to fix my habitation greatly concern to secure myself from any attack in the night either from wild beast or men towards night i fix upon a proper place under a rock and mark out a semicircle for my encampment which i resolve to strengthen with a work wall or fortification make of double pile line within with cable and without with turf from the th to the th i work very hard in carry all my good to my new habitation though some part of the time it rain exceed hard the st in the morning i go out into the island with my gun to see for some food and discover the country when i kill a she goat and her kid follow me home which i afterwards kill also because it would not fee november i set up my tent under a rock and lay there for the first night make it as large a i could with stake drive in to swing my hammock upon i set up all my chest and board and the piece of timber which make my raft and with them form a fence round me a little within the place i have mark out for my fortification i go out with my gun and kill two fowl like duck which be very good food in the afternoon go to work to make me a table this morning i begin to order my time of work of go out with my gun time of sleep and time of diversion viz every morning i walk out with my gun for two or three hour if it do not rain then employ myself to work till about eleven oclock then eat what i have to live on and from twelve to two i lay down to sleep the weather be excessive hot and then in the evening to work again the work part of this day and of the next be wholly employ in make my table for i be yet but a very sorry workman though time and necessity make me a complete natural mechanic soon after a i believe it would do any one els this day go abroad with my gun and my dog and kill a wild cat her skin pretty soft but her flesh good for nothing every creature i kill i take off the skin and preserve them come back by the seashore i saw many sort of seafowl which i do not understand but be surprise and almost fright with two or three seal which while i be gaze at not well know what they be get into the sea and escape me for that time after my morning walk i go to work with my table again and finish it though not to my like nor be it long before i learn to mend it now it begin to be settle fair weather the th th th th and part of the th for the th be sunday i take wholly up to make me a chair and with much ado bring it to a tolerable shape but never to please me and even in the making i pull it in piece several time note i soon neglect my keep sunday for omit my mark for them on my post i forget which be which this day it rain which refresh me exceedingly and cool the earth but it be accompany with terrible thunder and lightning which fright me dreadfully for fear of my powder as soon a it be over i resolve to separate my stock of powder into a many little parcel a possible that it might not be in danger nov these three day i spend in make little square chest or box which might hold a pound or two pound at most of powder and so put the powder in i stow it in place a secure and remote from one another a possible on one of these three day i kill a large bird that be good to eat but i know not what to call it this day i begin to dig behind my tent into the rock to make room for my farther conveniency note three thing i want exceedingly for this work viz a pickaxe a shovel and a wheelbarrow or basket so i desist from my work and begin to consider how to supply that want and make me some tool a for a pickaxe i make use of the iron crow which be proper enough though heavy but the next thing be a shovel or spade this be so absolutely necessary that indeed i could do nothing effectually without it but what kind of one to make i know not the next day in search the wood i find a tree of that wood or like it which in the brasil they call the iron tree for it exceed hardness of this with great labour and almost spoil my axe i cut a piece and bring it home too with difficulty enough for it be exceed heavy the excessive hardness of the wood and have no other way make me a long while upon this machine for i work it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade the handle exactly shape like ours in england only that the broad part have no iron shoe upon it at bottom it would not last me so long however it serve well enough for the us which i have occasion to put it to but never be a shovel i believe make after that fashion or so long a making i be still deficient for i want a basket or a wheelbarrow a basket i could not make by any mean have no such thing a twig that would bend to make wickerware at least none yet find out and a to a wheelbarrow i fancy i could make all but the wheel but that i have no notion of neither do i know how to go about it besides i have no possible way to make the iron gudgeon for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in so i give it over and so for carry away the earth which i dig out of the cave i make me a thing like a hod which the labourer carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayer this be not so difficult to me a the make the shovel and yet this and the shovel and the attempt which i make in vain to make a wheelbarrow take me up no less than four day i mean always except my morning walk with my gun which i seldom failed and very seldom fail also bring home something to eat my other work have now stand still because of my make these tool when they be finish i go on and work every day a my strength and time allow i spend eighteen day entirely in widening and deepen my cave that it might hold my good commodiously note during all this time i work to make this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me a a warehouse or magazine a kitchen a diningroom and a cellar a for my lodging i keep to the tent except that sometimes in the wet season of the year it rain so hard that i could not keep myself dry which cause me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long pole in the form of rafter lean against the rock and load them with flag and large leaf of tree like a thatch i begin now to think my cave or vault finish when on a sudden it seem i have make it too large a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side so much that in short it fright me and not without reason too for if i have be under it i have never want a gravedigger upon this disaster i have a great deal of work to do over again for i have the loose earth to carry out and which be of more importance i have the ceiling to prop up so that i might be sure no more would come down this day i go to work with it accordingly and get two shore or post pitch upright to the top with two piece of board across over each post this i finish the next day and set more post up with board in about a week more i have the roof secure and the post stand in row serve me for partition to part off my house from this day to the twentieth i place shelf and knock up nail on the post to hang every thing up that could be hang up and now i begin to be in some order within door now i carry every thing into the cave and begin to furnish my house and set up some piece of board like a dresser to order my victual upon but board begin to be very scarce with me also i make me another table much rain all night and all day no stir out rain all day no rain and the earth much cool than before and pleasanter kill a young goat and lam another so that i catch it and lead it home in a string when i have it home i bind and splinter up it leg which be broke nb i take such care of it that it live and the leg grow well and as strong a ever but by nurse it so long it grow tame and feed upon the little green at my door and would not go away this be the first time that i entertain a thought of breed up some tame creatures that i might have food when my powder and shot be all spent dec great heat and no breeze so that there be no stir abroad except in the evening for food this time i spend in put all my thing in order within door january very hot still but i go abroad early and late with my gun and lay still in the middle of the day this evening go far into the vallies which lay towards the centre of the island i find there be plenty of goat though exceed shy and hard to come at however i resolve to try if i could not bring my dog to hunt them down jan accordingly the next day i go out with my dog and set him upon the goat but i be mistake for they all face about upon the dog and he know hi danger too well for he would not come near them jan i begin my fence or wall which be still jealous of my be attack by somebody i resolve to make very thick and strong nb this wall be describe before i purposely omit what be say in the journal it be sufficient to observe that i be no less time than from the d of january to the th of april work finishing and perfect this wall though it be no more than about twentyfour yard in length be a halfcircle from one place in the rock to another place about eight yard from it the door of the cave be in the centre behind it all this time i work very hard the rain hinder me many day nay sometimes week together but i think i should never be perfectly secure until this wall be finish and it be scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing be do with especially the bringing pile out of the wood and drive them into the ground for i make them much big than i need to have do when this wall be finish and the outside double fence with a turf wall raise up close to it i persuade myself that if any people be to come on shore there they would not perceive any thing like a habitation and it be very well i do so a may be observe hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion during this time i make my round in the wood for game every day when the rain admit me and make frequent discovery in these walk of something or other to my advantage particularly i find a kind of wild pigeon who build not a wood pigeon in a tree but rather a house pigeon in the hole of the rock and take some young one i endeavour to breed them up tame and do so but when they grow old they fly away which perhaps be at first for want of feed them for i have nothing to give them however i frequently find their nest and get their young one which be very good meat and now in the manage my household affair i find myself want in many thing which i think at first it be impossible for me to make as indeed a to some of them it be for instance i could never make a cask to be hoop i have a small runlet or two a i observe before but i could never arrive to the capacity of make one by them though i spend many week about it i could neither put in the head or joint the stave so true to one another a to make them hold water so i give that also over in the next place i be at a great loss for candle so that as soon a ever it be dark which be generally by seven oclock i be oblige to go to bed i remember the lump of beeswax with which i make candle in my african adventure but i have none of that now the only remedy i have be that when i have kill a goat i save the tallow and with a little dish make of clay which i bake in the sun to which i add a wick of some oakum i make me a lamp and this give me light though not a clear steady light like a candle in the middle of all my labour it happen that rummage my thing i find a little bag which a i hint before have be fill with corn for the feeding of poultry not for this voyage but before a i suppose when the ship come from lisbon what little remainder of corn have be in the bag be all devour with the rat and i saw nothing in the bag but husk and dust and be willing to have the bag for some other use i think it be to put powder in when i divide it for fear of the lightning or some such use i shake the husk of corn out of it on one side of my fortification under the rock it be a little before the great rain just now mention that i throw this stuff away take no notice of any thing and not so much a remember that i have throw any thing there when about a month after or thereabout i saw some few stalk of something green shoot out of the ground which i fancy might be some plant i have not see but i be surprised and perfectly astonish when after a little long time i saw about ten or twelve ear come out which be perfect green barley of the same kind a our european nay a our english barley it be impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thought on this occasion i have hitherto act upon no religious foundation at all indeed i have very few notion of religion in my head or have entertain any sense of any thing that have befall me otherwise than a a chance or a we lightly say what please god without so much a inquire into the end of providence in these thing or hi order in govern event in the world but after i saw barley grow there in a climate which i know be not proper for corn and especially that i know not how it come there it startle me strangely and i begin to suggest that god have miraculously cause this grain to grow without any help of seed sown and that it be so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild miserable place this touch my heart a little and bring tear out of my eye and i begin to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account and this be the more strange to me because i saw near it still all along by the side of the rock some other straggle stalk which prove to be stalk of rice and which i know because i have see it grow in africa when i be ashore there i not only think these the pure production of providence for my support but not doubt but that there be more in the place i go all over that part of the island where i have be before peep in every corner and under every rock to see for more of it but i could not find any at last it occur to my thought that i have shake a bag of chicken meat out in that place and then the wonder begin to cease and i must confess my religious thankfulness to god providence begin to abate too upon discover that all this be nothing but what be common though i ought to have be a thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence a if it have be miraculous for it be really the work of providence a to me that should order or appoint ten or twelve grain of corn to remain unspoiled when the rat have destroy all the rest a if it have be drop from heaven a also that i should throw it out in that particular place where it be in the shade of a high rock it spring up immediately whereas if i have throw it any be els at that time it have be burn up and destroy i carefully save the ear of corn you may be sure in their season which be about the end of june and lay up every corn i resolve to sow them all again hop in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread but it be not till the fourth year that i could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat and even then but sparingly a i shall say afterwards in it order for i lose all that i sow the first season by not observe the proper time for i sow it just before the dry season so that it never come up at all at least not a it would have do of which in it place besides this barley there be a above twenty or thirty stalk of rice which i preserve with the same care and whose use be of the same kind or to the same purpose viz to make me bread or rather food for i find way to cook it up without bake though i do that also after some time but to return to my journal i work excessive hard these three or four month to get my wall do and the th of april i close it up contrive to go into it not by a door but over the wall by a ladder that there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation i finish the ladder so i go up with the ladder to the top and then pull it up after me and let it down on the inside this be a complete enclosure to me for within i have room enough and nothing could come at me from without unless it could first mount my wall the very next day after this wall be finish i have almost have all my labour overthrow at once and myself kill the case be thus a i be busy in the inside of it behind my tent just in the entrance into my cave i be terribly fright with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed for on a sudden i find the earth come crumble down from the roof of my cave and from the edge of the hill over my head and two of the post i have set up in the cave crack in a frightful manner i be heartily scar but think nothing of what be really the cause only think that the top of my cave be fall in a some of it have do before and for fear i should be bury in it i run forward to my ladder and not think myself safe there neither i get over my wall for fear of the piece of the hill which i expect might roll down upon me i be no sooner stept down upon the firm ground but i plainly saw it be a terrible earthquake for the ground i stand on shook three time at about eight minute distance with three such shock a would have overturn the strong building that could be suppose to have stand on the earth and a great piece of the top of a rock which stand about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terrible noise a i never hear in all my life i perceive also the very sea be put into violent motion by it and i believe the shock be strong under the water than on the island i be so amazed with the thing itself have never felt the like or discourse with any one that have that i be like one dead or stupified and the motion of the earth make my stomach sick like one that be toss at sea but the noise of the fall of the rock awake me a it be and rouse me from the stupified condition i be in fill me with horror and i think of nothing then but the hill fall upon my tent and all my household good and bury all at once and this sunk my very soul within me a second time after the third shock be over and i felt no more for some time i begin to take courage and yet i have not heart enough to get over my wall again for fear of be bury alive but sit still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate not know what to do all this while i have not the least serious religious thought nothing but the common lord have mercy upon me and when it be over that go away too while i sit thus i find the air overcast and grow cloudy a if it would rain soon after that the wind rise by little and little so that in less than half an hour it blow a most dreadful hurricane the sea be all on a sudden cover over with foam and froth the shore be cover with the breach of the water the tree be tear up by the root and a terrible storm it be and this hold about three hour and then begin to abate and in two hour more it be stark calm and begin to rain very hard all this while i sit upon the ground very much terrify and deject when on a sudden it come into my thought that these wind and rain be the consequence of the earthquake the earthquake itself be spend and over and i might venture into my cave again with this thought my spirit begin to revive and the rain also help to persuade me i go in and sit down in my tent but the rain be so violent that my tent be ready to be beat down with it and i be force to go into my cave though very much afraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my head this violent rain force me to a new work viz to cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink to let water go out which would els have drown my cave after i have be in my cave some time and find still no more shock of the earthquake follow i begin to be more composed and now to support my spirit which indeed want it very much i go to my little store and take a small sup of rum which however i do then and always very sparingly know i could have no more when that be go it continue rain all that night and great part of the next day so that i could not stir abroad but my mind be more composed i begin to think of what i have best do conclude that if the island be subject to these earthquake there would be no living for me in a cave but i must consider of building me some little hut in an open place which i might surround with a wall a i have do here and so make myself secure from wild beast or men but conclude if i staid where i be i should certainly one time or other be bury alive with these thought i resolve to remove my tent from the place where it stand which be just under the hanging precipice of the hill and which if it should be shake again would certainly fall upon my tent and i spend the two next day be the th and th of april in contrive where and how to remove my habitation the fear of be swallow up alive make me that i never sleep in quiet and yet the apprehension of lie abroad without any fence be almost equal to it but still when i look about and saw how every thing be put in order how pleasantly conceal i be and how safe from danger it make me very loth to remove in the meantime it occur to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this and that i must be content to run the venture where i be till i have form a camp for myself and have secure it so a to remove to it so with this resolution i compose myself for a time and resolve that i would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with pile and cable c in a circle a before and set my tent up in it when it be finish but that i would venture to stay where i be till it be finish and fit to remove to this be the st the next morning i begin to consider of mean to put this resolve in execution but i be at a great loss about my tool i have three large ax and abundance of hatchet for we carry the hatchet for traffic with the indian but with much chopping and cut knotty hard wood they be all full of notch and dull and though i have a grindstone i could not turn it and grind my tool too this cost me a much thought a a statesman would have bestow upon a grand point of politics or a judge upon the life and death of a man at length i contrive a wheel with a string to turn it with my foot that i might have both my hand at liberty note i have never see any such thing in england or at least not to take notice how it be do though since i have observe it be very common there besides that my grindstone be very large and heavy this machine cost me a full week work to bring it to perfection april these two whole day i take up in grind my tool my machine for turn my grindstone perform very well have perceive my bread have be low a great while now i take a survey of it and reduce myself to one biscuitcake a day which make my heart very heavy in the morning look towards the seaside the tide be low i saw something lie on the shore big than ordinary and it look like a cask when i come to it i find a small barrel and two or three piece of the wreck of the ship which be drive on shore by the late hurricane and look towards the wreck itself i think it seem to lie high out of the water than it use to do i examine the barrel which be drive on shore and soon find it be a barrel of gunpowder but it have take water and the powder be cake as hard a a stone however i roll it far on shore for the present and go on upon the sand as near a i could to the wreck of the ship to look for more when i come down to the ship i find it strangely remove the forecastle which lay before bury in sand be heave up at least six foot and the stern which be broke to piece and part from the rest by the force of the sea soon after i have leave rummage her be toss a it be up and cast on one side and the sand be throw so high on that side next her stern that whereas there be a great place of water before so that i could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim i could now walk quite up to her when the tide be out i be surprise with this at first but soon conclude it must be do by the earthquake and a by this violence the ship be more broken open than formerly so many thing come daily on shore which the sea have loosen and which the wind and water roll by degree to the land this wholly divert my thought from the design of remove my habitation and i busy myself mightily that day especially in search whether i could make any way into the ship but i find nothing be to be expect of that kind for that all the inside of the ship be choke up with sand however a i have learn not to despair of any thing i resolve to pull every thing to piece that i could of the ship conclude that every thing i could get from her would be of some use or other to me i begin with my saw and cut a piece of a beam through which i think hold some of the upper part or quarterdeck together and when i have cut it through i clear away the sand as well a i could from the side which lay high but the tide come in i be oblige to give over for that time way i go afishing but catch not one fish that i durst eat of till i be weary of my sport when just go to leave off i catch a young dolphin i have make me a long line of some rope yarn but i have no hook yet i frequently catch fish enough as much a i care to eat all which i dry in the sun and eat them dry work on the wreck cut another beam asunder and bring three great fir plank off from the deck which i tie together and make swim on shore when the tide of flood come on work on the wreck get several iron bolt out of her and other piece of ironwork work very hard and come home very much tire and have thought of give it over went to the wreck again but with an intent not to work but find the weight of the wreck have break itself down the beam be cut that several piece of the ship seem to lie loose and the inside of the hold lay so open that i could see into it but almost full of water and sand went to the wreck and carry an iron crow to wrench up the deck which lay now quite clear of the water or sand i wrench open two plank and bring them on shore also with the tide i leave the iron crow in the wreck for next day went to the wreck and with the crow make way into the body of the wreck and felt several cask and loosen them with the crow but could not break them up i felt also the roll of english lead and could stir it but it be too heavy to remove may went every day to the wreck and get a great many piece of timber and board or plank and two or three hundred weight of iron i carry two hatchet to try if i could not cut a piece off the roll of lead by place the edge of one hatchet and drive it with the other but a it lay about a foot and a half in the water i could not make any blow to drive the hatchet it have blow hard in the night and the wreck appear more broken by the force of the water but i staid so long in the wood to get pigeon for food that the tide prevent me go to the wreck that day i saw some piece of the wreck blow on shore at a great distance near two mile off me but resolve to see what they be and find it be a piece of the head but too heavy for me to bring away every day to this day i work on the wreck and with hard labour i loosen some thing so much with the crow that the first flow tide several cask float out and two of the seamens chest but the wind blowing from the shore nothing come to land that day but piece of timber and a hogshead which have some brasil pork in it but the salt water and the sand have spoil it i continue this work every day to the th of june except the time necessary to get food which i always appoint during this part of my employment to be when the tide be up that i might be ready when it be ebb out and by this time i have get timber and plank and ironwork enough to have build a good boat if i have know how and also i get at several time and in several piece near one hundred weight of the sheetlead go down to the seaside i find a large tortoise or turtle this be the first i have see which it seem be only my misfortune not any defect of the place or scarcity for have i happen to be on the other side of the island i might have have hundred of them every day a i find afterwards but perhaps have pay dear enough for them i spend in cook the turtle i find in her threescore egg and her flesh be to me at that time the most savory and pleasant that ever i taste in my life have have no flesh but of goat and fowl since i land in this horrid place rain all day and i stay within i think at this time the rain felt cold and i be something chilly which i know be not usual in that latitude very ill and shivering a if the weather have be cold no rest all night violent pain in my head and feverish very ill fright almost to death with the apprehension of my sad condition to be sick and no help pray to god for the first time since the storm off hull but scarce know what i say or why my thought be all confuse a little well but under dreadful apprehension of sickness very bad again cold and shivering and then a violent headach much well an ague very violent the fit hold me seven hour cold fit and hot with faint sweat after it better and have no victual to eat take my gun but find myself very weak however i kill a shegoat and with much difficulty get it home and broil some of it and eat i would fain have stew it and make some broth but have no pot the ague again so violent that i lay abed all day and neither ate or drank i be ready to perish for thirst but so weak i have not strength to stand up or to get myself any water to drink prayed to god again but be lightheaded and when i be not i be so ignorant that i know not what to say only i lay and cry lord look upon me lord pity me lord have mercy upon me i suppose i do nothing els for two or three hour till the fit wear off i fell asleep and do not wake till far in the night when i wake i find myself much refresh but weak and exceed thirsty however a i have no water in my whole habitation i be force to lie till morning and go to sleep again in this second sleep i have this terrible dream i think that i be sit on the ground on the outside of my wall where i sit when the storm blew after the earthquake and that i saw a man descend from a great black cloud in a bright flame of fire and light upon the ground he be all over as bright a a flame so that i could but just bear to look towards him hi countenance be most inexpressibly dreadful impossible for word to describe when he step upon the ground with hi foot i think the earth tremble just a it have do before in the earthquake and all the air look to my apprehension a if it have be fill with flash of fire he be no sooner land upon the earth but he move forward towards me with a long spear or weapon in hi hand to kill me and when he come to a rise ground at some distance he speak to me or i hear a voice so terrible that it be impossible to express the terror of it all that i can say i understood be this see all these thing have not bring thee to repentance now thou shall die at which word i think he lift up the spear that be in hi hand to kill me no one that shall ever read this account will expect that i should be able to describe the horror of my soul at this terrible vision i mean that even while it be a dream i even dream of those horror nor be it any more possible to describe the impression that remain upon my mind when i awake and find it be but a dream i have alas no divine knowledge what i have receive by the good instruction of my father be then wear out by an uninterrupted series for eight year of seafaring wickedness and a constant conversation with nothing but such a be like myself wicked and profane to the last degree i do not remember that i have in all that time one thought that so much a tend either to look upwards toward god or inwards towards a reflection upon my own way but a certain stupidity of soul without desire of good or conscience of evil have entirely overwhelm me and i be all that the most hardened unthinking wicked creature among our common sailor can be suppose to be not have the least sense either of the fear of god in danger or of thankfulness to god in deliverance in the relating what be already past of my story this will be the more easily believe when i shall add that through all the variety of misery that have to this day befallen me i never have so much a one thought of it be the hand of god or that it be a just punishment for my sin my rebellious behaviour against my father or my present sin which be great or so much a a punishment for the general course of my wicked life when i be on the desperate expedition on the desert shore of africa i never have so much a one thought of what would become of me or one wish to god to direct me whither i should go or to keep me from the danger which apparently surround me a well from voracious creature a cruel savage but i be merely thoughtless of a god or a providence act like a mere brute from the principle of nature and by the dictate of common sense only and indeed hardly that when i be deliver and take up at sea by the portugal captain well use and deal justly and honourably with as well a charitably i have not the least thankfulness on my thought when again i be shipwreck ruined and in danger of drown on this island i be a far from remorse or look on it a a judgment i only say to myself often that i be an unfortunate dog and bear to be always miserable it be true when i get on shore first here and find all my ship crew drown and myself spar i be surprise with a kind of ecstasy and some transport of soul which have the grace of god assist might have come up to true thankfulness but it end where it begin in a mere common flight of joy or a i may say be glad i be alive without the least reflection upon the distinguish goodness of the hand which have preserve me and have single me out to be preserve when all the rest be destroy or an inquiry why providence have be thus merciful to me even just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have after they have get safe on shore from a shipwreck which they drown all in the next bowl of punch and forget almost as soon a it be over and all the rest of my life be like it even when i be afterwards on due consideration make sensible of my condition how i be cast on this dreadful place out of the reach of human kind out of all hope of relief or prospect of redemption as soon a i saw but a prospect of living and that i should not starve and perish for hunger all the sense of my affliction wear off and i begin to be very easy apply myself to the work proper for my preservation and supply and be far enough from be afflict at my condition a a judgment from heaven or a the hand of god against me these be thought which very seldom enter into my head the grow up of the corn a be hint in my journal have at first some little influence upon me and begin to affect me with seriousness as long a i think it have something miraculous in it but as soon a ever that part of thought be remove all the impression which be raise from it wear off also a i have note already even the earthquake though nothing could be more terrible in it nature or more immediately direct to the invisible power which alone direct such thing yet no sooner be the first fright over but the impression it have make go off also i have no more sense of god or hi judgment much less of the present affliction of my circumstance be from hi hand than if i have be in the most prosperous condition of life but now when i begin to be sick and a leisurely view of the misery of death come to place itself before me when my spirit begin to sink under the burden of a strong distemper and nature be exhaust with the violence of the fever conscience that have slept so long begin to awake and i begin to reproach myself with my past life in which i have so evidently by uncommon wickedness provoke the justice of god to lay me under uncommon stroke and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner these reflection oppress me from the second or third day of my distemper and in the violence as well of the fever a of the dreadful reproach of my conscience extort some word from me like pray to god though i can not say they be either a prayer attend with desire or with hope it be rather the voice of mere fright and distress my thought be confuse the conviction great upon my mind and the horror of die in such a miserable condition raise vapour into my head with the mere apprehension and in these hurry of my soul i know not what my tongue might express but it be rather exclamation such a lord what a miserable creature be i if i should be sick i shall certainly die for want of help and what will become of me then the tear burst out of my eye and i could say no more for a good while in this interval the good advice of my father come to my mind and presently hi prediction which i mention in the beginning of this story viz that if i do take this foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery now say i aloud my dear father word be come to pass god justice have overtake me and i have none to help or hear me i reject the voice of providence which have mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein i might have be happy and easy but i would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parent i leave them to mourn over my folly and now i be leave to mourn under the consequence of it i refuse their help and assistance who would have lift me into the world and would have make every thing easy to me and now i have difficulty to struggle with too great for even nature itself to support and no assistance no help no comfort no advice then i cry out lord be my help for i be in great distress this be the first prayer if i might call it so that i have make for many year but i return to my journal having be somewhat refresh with the sleep i have have and the fit be entirely off i get up and though the fright and terror of my dream be very great yet i consider that the fit of the ague would return again the next day and now be my time to get something to refresh and support myself when i should be ill and the first thing i do i fill a large square casebottle with water and set it upon my table in reach of my bed and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water i put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mix them together then i get me a piece of the goat flesh and broil it on the coal but could eat very little i walk about but be very weak and withal very sad and heavyhearted under a sense of my miserable condition dread the return of my distemper the next day at night i make my supper of three of the turtle egg which i roast in the ash and ate a we call it in the shell and this be the first bit of meat i have ever ask god bless to even a i could remember in my whole life after i have eat i try to walk but find myself so weak that i could hardly carry the gun for i never go out without that so i go but a little way and sit down upon the ground look out upon the sea which be just before me and very calm and smooth a i sit here some such thought a these occur to me what be the earth and sea of which i have see so much whence be it produce and what be i and all the other creature wild and tame human and brutal whence be we sure we be all make by some secret power who form the earth and sea the air and sky and who be that then it follow most naturally it be god that have make it all well but then it come on strangely if god have make all these thing he guide and govern them all and all thing that concern them for the being that could make all thing must certainly have power to guide and direct them if so nothing can happen in the great circuit of hi work either without hi knowledge or appointment and if nothing happen without hi knowledge he know that i be here and be in a dreadful condition and if nothing happen without hi appointment he have appoint all this to befal me nothing occur to my thought to contradict any of these conclusion and therefore it rest upon me with the great force that it must needs be that god have appoint all this to befal me that i be bring to this miserable circumstance by hi direction he have the sole power not of me only but of every thing that happen in the world immediately it follow why have god do this to me what have i do to be thus use my conscience presently check me in that inquiry a if i have blaspheme and methought it speak to me like a voice wretch dost thou ask what thou hast do look back upon a dreadful mispent life and ask thyself what thou hast not do ask why be it that thou wert not long ago destroy why wert thou not drown in yarmouth road kill in the fight when the ship be take by the sallee man of war devour by the wild beast on the coast of africa or drown here when all the crew perish but thyself dost thou ask what have i do i be strike with these reflection a one astonished and have not a word to say no not to answer to myself but rise up pensive and sad walk back to my retreat and go up over my wall a if i have be go to bed but my thought be sadly disturbed and i have no inclination to sleep so i sit down in my chair and light my lamp for it begin to be dark now a the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrify me very much it occur to my thought that the brasilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distemper and i have a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chest which be quite cure and some also that be green and not quite cure i go direct by heaven no doubt for in this chest i find a cure both for soul and body i open the chest and find what i look for viz the tobacco and a the few book i have save lay there too i take out one of the bible which i mention before and which to this time i have not find leisure or so much a inclination to look into i say i take it out and bring both that and the tobacco with me to the table what use to make of the tobacco i know not a to my distemper or whether it be good for it or no but i try several experiment with it a if i be resolve it should hit one way or other i first take a piece of a leaf and chew it in my mouth which indeed at first almost stupified my brain the tobacco be green and strong and that i have not be much use to it then i take some and steep it an hour or two in some rum and resolve to take a dose of it when i lay down and lastly i burn some upon a pan of coal and hold my nose close over the smoke of it as long a i could bear it as well for the heat a the virtue of it and i hold almost to suffocation in the interval of this operation i take up the bible and begin to read but my head be too much disturb with the tobacco to bear reading at least at that time only have open the book casually the first word that occur to me be these call on me in the day of trouble and i will deliver and thou shalt glorify me the word be very apt to my case and make some impression upon my thought at the time of read them though not so much a they do afterwards for a for be deliver the word have no sound a i may say to me the thing be so remote so impossible in my apprehension of thing that i begin to say a the child of israel do when they be promise flesh to eat can god spread a table in the wilderness so i begin to say can god himself deliver me from this place and a it be not for many year that any hope appear this prevailed very often upon my thought but however the word make a very great impression upon me and i muse upon them very often it grow now late and the tobacco have a i say doze my head so much that i incline to sleep so that i leave my lamp burning in the cave l i should want any thing in the night and go to bed but before i lay down i do what i never have do in all my life i kneel down and pray to god to fulfil the promise to me that if i call upon him in the day of trouble he would deliver me after my broken and imperfect prayer be over i drink the rum in which i have steep the tobacco which be so strong and rank of the tobacco that indeed i could scarce get it down immediately upon this i go to bed and i find presently it fly up into my head violently but i fell into a sound sleep and wake no more till by the sun it must necessarily be near three oclock in the afternoon the next day nay to this hour i be partly of the opinion that i sleep all the next day and night and till almost three the day after for otherwise i know not how i should lose a day out of my reckoning in the day of the week a it appear some year after i have do for if i have lose it by cross and recrossing the line i should have lose more than a day but in my account it be lose and i never know which way be that however one way or other when i awake i find myself exceedingly refresh and my spirit lively and cheerful when i get up i be strong than i be the day before and my stomach well for i be hungry and in short i have no fit the next day but continue much alter for the good this be the th the th be my well day of course and i go abroad with my gun but do not care to travel too far i kill a seafowl or two something like a brand goose and bring them home but be not very forward to eat them so i eat some more of the turtle egg which be very good this evening i renew the medicine which i have suppose do me good the day before viz the tobacco steep in rum only i do not take so much a before nor do i chew any of the leaf or hold my head over the smoke however i be not so well the next day which be the st of july a i hop i should have be for i have a little spice of the cold fit but it be not much july i renew the medicine all the three way and doze myself with it at first and double the quantity which i drink july i miss the fit for good and all though i do not recover my full strength for some week after while i be thus gather strength my thought run exceedingly upon this scripture i will deliver thee and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind in bar of my ever expect it but a i be discourage myself with such thought it occur to my mind that i pore so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction that i disregard the deliverance i have receive and i be a it be make to ask myself such question a these viz have i not be deliver and wonderfully too from sickness from the most distressed condition that could be and that be so frightful to me and what notice have i take of it have i do my part god have deliver me but i have not glorify him that be to say i have not own and be thankful for that a a deliverance and how could i expect great deliverance this touch my heart very much and immediately i kneel down and give god thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness july in the morning i take the bible and begin at the new testament i begin seriously to read it and impose upon myself to read a while every morning and every night not tie myself to the number of chapter but as long a my thought should engage me it be not long after i set seriously to this work but i find my heart more deeply and sincerely affect with the wickedness of my past life the impression of my dream revive and the word all these thing have not bring thee to repentance ran seriously in my thought i be earnestly beg of god to give me repentance when it happen providentially the very day that read the scripture i come to these word he be exalt a prince and a saviour to give repentance and to give remission i throw down the book and with my heart as well a my hand lift up to heaven in a kind of ecstasy of joy i cry out aloud jesus thou son of david jesus thou exalt prince and saviour give me repentance this be the first time that i could say in the true sense of the word that i pray in all my life for now i pray with a sense of my condition and with a true scripture view of hope found on the encouragement of the word of god and from this time i may say i begin to have hope that god would hear me now i begin to construe the word mention above call on me and i will deliver thee in a different sense from what i have ever do before for then i have no notion of any thing be call deliverance but my be deliver from the captivity i be in for though i be indeed at large in the place yet the island be certainly a prison to me and that in the bad sense in the world but now i learn to take it in another sense now i look back upon my past life with such horror and my sin appear so dreadful that my soul seek nothing of god but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort a for my solitary life it be nothing i do not so much a pray to be deliver from it or think of it it be all of no consideration in comparison of this and i add this part here to hint to whoever shall read it that whenever they come to a true sense of thing they will find deliverance from sin a much great bless than deliverance from affliction but leave this part i return to my journal my condition begin now to be though not less miserable a to my way of living yet much easy to my mind and my thought be direct by a constant reading the scripture and pray to god to thing of a high nature i have a great deal of comfort within which till now i know nothing of also a my health and strength return i bestir myself to furnish myself with every thing that i want and make my way of living as regular a i could from the th of july to the th i be chiefly employ in walk about with my gun in my hand a little and a little at a time a a man that be gather up hi strength after a fit of sickness for it be hardly to be imagine how low i be and to what weakness i be reduce the application which i make use of be perfectly new and perhaps what have never cure an ague before neither can i recommend it to any one to practise by this experiment and though it do carry off the fit yet it rather contribute to weaken me for i have frequent convulsion in my nerve and limb for some time i learn from it also this in particular that be abroad in the rainy season be the most pernicious thing to my health that could be especially in those rain which come attend with storm and hurricane of wind for a the rain which come in a dry season be always most accompanied with such storm so i find this rain be much more dangerous than the rain which fell in september and october i have be now in this unhappy island above ten month all possibility of deliverance from this condition seem to be entirely take from me and i firmly believe that no human shape have ever set foot upon that place have now secure my habitation a i think fully to my mind i have a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island and to see what other production i might find which yet i know nothing of it be the th of july that i begin to take a more particular survey of the island itself i go up the creek first where a i hint i bring my raft on shore i find after i come about two mile up that the tide do not flow any high and that it be no more than a little brook of run water and very fresh and good but this be the dry season there be hardly any water in some part of it at least not enough to run into any stream so a it could be perceive on the bank of this brook i find many pleasant savanna or meadow plain smooth and cover with grass and on the rise part of them next to the high ground where the water a it might be suppose never overflow i find a great deal of tobacco green and grow to a great and very strong stalk there be diver other plant which i have no notion of or understand about and might perhaps have virtue of their own which i could not find out i search for the cassave root which the indian in all that climate make their bread of but i could find none i saw large plant of aloe but do not then understand them i saw several sugarcane but wild and for want of cultivation imperfect i content myself with these discovery for this time and come back muse with myself what course i might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruit or plant which i should discover but could bring it to no conclusion for in short i have make so little observation while i be in the brasil that i know little of the plant of the field at least very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress the next day the th i go up the same way again and after go something farther than i have do the day before i find the brook and the savanna begin to cease and the country become more woody than before in this part i find different fruit and particularly i find melon upon the ground in great abundance and grape upon the tree the vine have spread indeed over the tree and the cluster of grape be just now in their prime very ripe and rich this be a surprising discovery and i be exceed glad of them but i be warn by my experience to eat sparingly of them remember that when i be ashore in barbary the eating of grape kill several of our englishman who be slave there by throw them into flux and fever but i find an excellent use for these grape and that be to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them a dry grape or raisin be kept which i think would be a indeed they be a wholesome and a agreeable to eat when no grape might be have i spend all that even there and go not back to my habitation which by the way be the first night a i might say i have lie from home in the night i take my first contrivance and get up into a tree where i sleep well and the next morning proceed upon my discovery travel near four mile a i might judge by the length of the valley keep still due north with a ridge of hill on the south and north side of me at the end of this march i come to an opening where the country seem to descend to the west and a little spring of fresh water which issue out of the side of the hill by me run the other way that be due east and the country appear so fresh so green so flourishing every thing be in a constant verdure or flourish of spring that it look like a planted garden i descend a little on the side of that delicious valley survey it with a secret kind of pleasure though mixed with other afflict thought to think that this be all my own that i be king and lord of all this country indefeasibly and have a right of possession and if i could convey it i might have it in inheritance as completely a any lord of a manor in england i saw here abundance of cocoatrees orange and lemon and citrontrees but all wild and few bearing any fruit at least not then however the green lime that i gather be not only pleasant to eat but very wholesome and i mix their juice afterwards with water which make it very wholesome and very cool and refresh i find now i have business enough to gather and carry home and resolve to lay up a store a well of grape a lime and lemon to furnish myself for the wet season which i know be approach in order to do this i gather a great heap of grape in one place and a less heap in another place and a great parcel of lime and lemon in another place and take a few of each with me i travel homeward and resolve to come again and bring a bag or sack or what i could make to carry the rest home accordingly have spend three day in this journey i come home so i must now call my tent and my cave but before i get thither the grape be spoil the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice have break them and bruise them they be good for little or nothing a to the lime they be good but i could bring but a few the next day be the th i go back have make me two small bag to bring home my harvest but i be surprise when come to my heap of grape which be so rich and fine when i gather them i find them all spread abroad trod to piece and drag about some here some there and abundance eaten and devour by this i conclude there be some wild creature thereabouts which have do this but what they be i know not however a i find there be no lay them up on heap and no carry them away in a sack but that one way they would be destroy and the other way they would be crush with their own weight i take another course for i gather a large quantity of the grape and hang them upon the out branch of the tree that they might cure and dry in the sun and a for the lime and lemon i carry a many back a i could well stand under when i come home from this journey i contemplate with great pleasure on the fruitfulness of that valley and the pleasantness of the situation the security from storm on that side of the water and the wood and conclude that i have pitch upon a place to fix my abode which be by far the bad part of the country upon the whole i begin to consider of remove my habitation and to look out for a place equally safe a where i now be situate if possible in that pleasant fruitful part of the island this think ran long in my head and i be exceed fond of it for some time the pleasantness of the place tempt me but when i come to a near view of it and to consider that i be now by the seaside where it be at least possible that something might happen to my advantage and that the same ill fate that bring me hither might bring some other unhappy wretch to the same place and though it be scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen yet to enclose myself among the hill and wood in the centre of the island be to anticipate my bondage and to render such an affair not only improbable but impossible and that therefore i ought not by any mean to remove however i be so enamoured with this place that i spend much of my time there for the whole remain part of the month of july and though upon second thought i resolve as above not to remove yet i build me a little kind of a bower and surround it at a distance with a strong fence be a double hedge as high a i could reach well staked and fill between with brushwood and here i lay very secure sometimes two or three night together always go over it with a ladder a before so that i fancy now i have my country house and my seacoast house and this work take me up the beginning of august i have but newly finish my fence and begin to enjoy my labour but the rain come on and make me stick close to my first habitation for though i have make me a tent like the other with a piece of a sail and spread it very well yet i have not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storm nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rain be extraordinary about the beginning of august a i say i have finish my bower and begin to enjoy myself the d of august i find the grape i have hang up be perfectly dry and indeed be excellent good raisin of the sun so i begin to take them down from the tree and it be very happy that i do so for the rain which follow would have spoil them and i have lose the best part of my winter food for i have above two hundred large bunch of them no sooner have i take them all down and carry most of them home to my cave but it begin to rain and from thence which be the th of august it rain more or less every day till the middle of october and sometimes so violently that i could not stir out of my cave for several day in this season i be much surprise with the increase of my family i have be concern for the loss of one of my cat who run away from me or a i think have be dead and i hear no more tale or tidings of her till to my astonishment she come home about the end of august with three kitten this be the more strange to me because though i have kill a wild cat a i call it with my gun yet i think it be a quite different kind from our european cat yet the young cat be the same kind of house breed like the old one and both my cat be female i think it very strange but from these three cat i afterwards come to be so pestered with cat that i be force to kill them like vermin or wild beast and to drive them from my house as much a possible from the th of august to the th incessant rain so that i could not stir and be now very careful not to be much wet in this confinement i begin to be straiten for food but venture out twice i one day kill a goat and the last day which be the th find a very large tortoise which be a treat to me and my food be regulate thus i eat a bunch of raisin for my breakfast a piece of the goat flesh or of the turtle for my dinner broil for to my great misfortune i have no vessel to boil or stew any thing and two or three of the turtle egg for supper during this confinement in my cover by the rain i work daily two or three hour at enlarge my cave and by degree work it on towards one side till i come to the outside of the hill and make a door or way out which come beyond my fence or wall and so i come in and out this way but i be not perfectly easy at lie so open for a i have manage myself before i be in a perfect enclosure whereas now i think i lay expose and yet i could not perceive that there be any living thing to fear the big creature that i have see upon the island be a goat september the th i be now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing i cast up the notch on my post and find i have be on shore three hundred and sixtyfive day i keep this day a a solemn fast set it apart to a religious exercise prostrate myself to the ground with the most serious humiliation confess myself to god acknowledge hi righteous judgment upon me and pray to him to have mercy on me through jesus christ and have not taste the least refreshment for twelve hour even till the go down of the sun i then eat a biscuitcake and a bunch of grape and go to bed finish the day a i begin it i have all this time observe no sabbathday for as at first i have no sense of religion upon my mind i have after some time omit to distinguish the week by make a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbathday and so do not really know what any of the day be but now have cast up the day a before i find i have be there a year so i divide it into week and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath though i find at the end of my account i have lose a day or two of my reckon a little after this my ink begin to fail me and so i content myself to use it more sparingly and to write down only the most remarkable event of my life without continue a daily memorandum of other thing the rainy season and the dry season begin now to appear regular to me and i learn to divide them so a to provide for them accordingly but i buy all my experience before i have it and this i be go to relate be one of the most discouraging experiment that i make at all i have mention that i have save the few ear of barley and rice which i have so surprisingly find spring up a i think of themselves and believe there be about thirty stalk of rice and about twenty of barley and now i think it a proper time to sow it after the rain the sun be in it southern position go from me accordingly i dig up a piece of ground as well a i could with my wooden spade and divide it into two part i sow my grain but a i be sow it casually occur to my thought that i would not sow it all at first because i do not know when be the proper time for it so i sow about two third of the seed leave about a handful of each it be a great comfort to me afterwards that i do so for not one grain of that i sow this time come to any thing for the dry month follow the earth have have no rain after the seed be sow it have no moisture to assist it growth and never come up at all till the wet season have come again and then it grow a if it have be newly sow finding my first seed do not grow which i easily imagine be by the drought i seek for a moist piece of ground to make another trial in and i dig up a piece of ground near my new bower and sow the rest of my seed in february a little before the vernal equinox and this have the rainy month of march and april to water it spring up very pleasantly and yield a very good crop but have part of the seed leave only and not dare to sow all that i have yet i have but a small quantity at last my whole crop not amount to above half a peck of each kind but by this experience i be make master of my business and know exactly when the proper season be to sow and that i might expect two seedtime and two harvest every year while this corn be grow i make a little discovery which be of use to me afterwards as soon a the rain be over and the weather begin to settle which be about the month of november i make a visit up the country to my bower where though i have not be some month yet i find all thing just a i leave them the circle or double hedge that i have make be not only firm and entire but the stake which i have cut off of some tree that grow thereabouts be all shoot out and grown with long branch as much a a willow tree usually shoot the first year after lop it head i could not tell what tree to call it that these stake be cut from i be surprise and yet very well pleased to see the young tree grow and i prune them and lead them up to grow a much alike a i could and it be scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grow into in three year so that though the hedge make a circle of about twentyfive yard in diameter yet the tree for such i might now call them soon cover it and it be a complete shade sufficient to lodge under all the dry season this make me resolve to cut some more stake and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall i mean that of my first dwelling which i do and place the tree or stake in a double row at above eight yard distance from my first fence they grow presently and be at first a fine cover to my habitation and afterwards serve for a defence also a i shall observe in it order i find now that the season of the year might generally be divide not into summer and winter a in europe but into the rainy season and the dry season which be generally thus half february rainy the sun be then on or near the equinox march half april half april may dry the sun be then to the north of the line june july half august half august september rain the sun be then come back half october half october november dry the sun be then to the south of the line december january half february the rainy season sometimes hold longer or short a the wind happen to blow but this be the general observation i make after i have find by experience the ill consequence of be abroad in the rain i take care to furnish myself with provision beforehand that i might not be oblige to go out and i sit within door as much a possible during the wet month in this time i find much employment and very suitable also to the time for i find great occasion of many thing which i have no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application particularly i try many way to make myself a basket but all the twig i could get for the purpose prove so brittle that they would do nothing it prove of excellent advantage to me now that when i be a boy i use to take great delight in stand at a basketmaker in the town where my father live to see them make their wickerware and be a boy usually be very officious to help and a great observer of the manner how they work those thing and sometimes lend an hand i have by this mean so full knowledge of the method of it that i want nothing but the material when it come into my mind that the twig of that tree from whence i cut my stake that grow might possibly be as tough a the sallow and willow and osier in england and i resolve to try accordingly the next day i go to my countryhouse a i call it and cut some of the small twig i find them to my purpose as much a i could desire whereupon i come the next time prepare with an hatchet to cut down a quantity which i soon find for there be a great plenty of them these i set up to dry within my circle or hedge and when they be fit for use i carry them to my cave and here during the next season i employ myself in make as well a i could a great many basket both to carry earth or to carry or lay up any thing a i have occasion and though i do not finish them very handsomely yet i make them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose and thus afterwards i take care never to be without them and a my wickerware decay i make more especially i make strong deep basket to place my corn in instead of sack when i should come to have any quantity of it have master this difficulty and employ a world of time about it i bestir myself to see if possible how to supply two want i have no vessel to hold any thing that be liquid except two rundlets which be almost full of rum and some glass bottle some of the common size and other which be casebottles square for the holding of water spirit c i have not so much a a pot to boil any thing in except a great kettle which i save out of the ship and which be too big for such us a i desire it for viz to make broth and stew a bit of meat by itself the second thing i would fain have have be a tobaccopipe but it be impossible for me to make one however i find a contrivance for that too at last i employ myself in plant my second row of stake of pile and in this wickerwork all the summer or dry season when another business take me up more time than it could be imagine i could spare i mention before that i have a great mind to see the whole island and that i have travel up the brook and so on to where i build my bower and where i have an opening quite to the sea on the other side of the island i now resolve to travel quite across to the sea shore on that side so take my gun and hatchet and my dog and a large quantity of powder and shot than usual with two biscuitcakes and a great bunch of raisin in my pouch for my store i begin my journey when i have pass the vale where my bower stand a above i come within view of the sea to the west and it be a very clear day i fairly descry land whether an island or continent i could not tell but it lay very high extend from the west to the wsw at a very great distance by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty league off i could not tell what part of the world this might be otherwise than that i know it must be part of america and a i conclude by all my observation must be near the spanish dominion and perhaps be all inhabit by savage where if i should have land i have be in a bad condition than i be now and therefore i acquiesce in the disposition of providence which i begin now to own and to believe order every thing for the best i say i quiet my mind with this and leave afflict myself with fruitless wish of be there besides after some pause upon this affair i consider that if this land be the spanish coast i should certainly one time or other see some vessel pass or repass one way or other but if not then it be the savage coast between the spanish country and brasil which be indeed the bad of savage for they be cannibal or meneaters and fail not to murder and devour all the human body that fall into their hand with these consideration i walk very leisurely forward i find that side of the island where i now be much pleasant than mine the open or savanna field sweet adorn with flower and grass and full of very fine wood i saw abundance of parrot and fain would i have catch one if possible to have keep it to be tame and teach it to speak to me i do after some painstaking catch a young parrot for i knock it down with a stick and have recover it i bring it home but it be some year before i could make him speak however at last i teach him to call me by my name very familiarly but the accident that follow though it be a trifle will be very divert in it place i be exceedingly divert with this journey i find in the low ground hare a i think them to be and fox but they differ greatly from all the other kind i have meet with nor could i satisfy myself to eat them though i kill several but i have no need to be venturous for i have no want of food and of that which be very good too especially these three sort viz goat pigeon and turtle or tortoise which add to my grape leadenhallmarket could not have furnish a well table than i in proportion to the company and though my case be deplorable enough yet i have great cause for thankfulness that i be not drive to any extremity for food but rather plenty even to dainty i never travel in this journey above two mile outright in a day or thereabouts but i look so many turn and return to see what discoveries i could make that i come weary enough to the place where i resolve to sit down for all night and then either repose myself in a tree or surround myself with a row of stake set upright in the ground either from one tree to another or so a no wild creature could come at me without wake me as soon a i come to the seashore i be surprise to see that i have take up my lot on the bad side of the island for here indeed the shore be cover with innumerable turtle whereas on the other side i have find but three in a year and an half here be also an infinitenumber of fowl of many kind some of which i have not see before and many of them very good meat but such a i know not the name of except those call penguin i could have shoot as many a i please but be very spar of my powder and shot and therefore have more mind to kill a shegoat if i could which i could well fee on and though there be many goat here more than on the other side of the island yet it be with much more difficulty that i could come near them the country be flat and even and they saw me much sooner than when i be on the hill i confess this side of the country be much pleasant than mine but yet i have not the least inclination to remove for a i be fix in my habitation it become natural to me and i seem all the while i be here to be a it be upon a journey and from home however i travel along the shore of the sea towards the east i suppose about twelve mile and then set up a great pole upon the shore for a mark i conclude i would go home again and the next journey i take should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling and so round till i come to my post again of which in it place i take another way to come back than that i go think i could easily keep all the island so much in my view that i could not miss find my first dwelling by view the country but i find myself mistaken for be come about two or three mile i find myself descend into a very large valley but so surrounded with hill and those hill cover with wood that i could not see which be my way by any direction but that of the sun nor even then unless i know very well the position of the sun at that time of the day it happen to my farther misfortune that the weather prove hazy for three or four day while i be in this valley and not be able to see the sun i wander about very uncomfortably and at last be oblige to find out the seaside look for my post and come back the same way i go and then by easy journies i turn homeward the weather be exceed hot and my gun ammunition hatchet and other thing very heavy in this journey my dog surprise a young kid and seize upon it and i run in to take hold of it catch it and save it alive from the dog i have a great mind to bring it home if i could for i have often be muse whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two and so raise a breed of tame goat which might supply me when my powder and shot should be spend i make a collar for this little creature and with a string which i make of some ropeyarn which i always carry about me i lead him along though with some difficulty till i come to my bower and there i enclose him and leave him for i be very impatient to be at home from whence i have be absent above a month i can not express what a satisfaction it be to me to come into my old hutch and lie down in my hammockbed this little wander journey without a settled place of abode have be so unpleasant to me that my own house a i call it to myself be a perfect settlement to me compare to that and it render every thing about me so comfortable that i resolve i would never go a great way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the island i repose myself here a week to rest and regale myself after my long journey during which most of the time be take up in the weighty affair of make a cage for my pol who begin now to be a mere domestic and to be mighty well acquaint with me then i begin to think of the poor kid which i have pent in within my little circle and resolve to go and fetch it home and give it some food accordingly i go and find it where i leave it for indeed it could not get out but be almost starve for want of food i go and cut bough of tree and branch of such shrub a i could find and throw it over and have feed it i tie it a i do before to lead it away but it be so tame with be hungry that i have no need to have tie it for it follow me like a dog and a i continually feed it the creature become so love so gentle and so fond that it become from that time one of my domestic also and would never leave me afterwards the rainy season of the autumnal equinox be now come and i keep the th of september in the same solemn manner a before be the anniversary of my landing on the island have now be there two year and no more prospect of be deliver than the first day i come there i spend the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgment of the many wonderful mercy which my solitary condition be attend with and without which it might have be infinitely more miserable i give humble and hearty thanks that god have be please to discover to me even that it be possible i might be more happy in this solitary condition than i should have be in a liberty of society and in all the pleasure of the world that he could fully make up to me the deficiency of my solitary state and the want of human society by hi presence and the communication of hi grace to my soul support comforting and encourage me to depend upon hi providence here and hope for hi eternal presence hereafter it be now that i begin sensibly to feel how much more happy the life i now lead be with all it miserable circumstance than the wicked curse abominable life i lead all the past part of my day and now have change both my sorrow and my joy my very desires alter my affection change their gust and my delight be perfectly new from what they be at first come or indeed for the two year past before a i walk about either on my hunting or for view the country the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden and my very heart would die within me to think of the wood the mountain the desert i be in and how i be a prisoner lock up with the eternal bar and bolt of the ocean in an uninhabited wilderness without redemption in the midst of the great composure of my mind this would break out upon me like a storm and make me wring my hand and weep like a child sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work and i would immediately sit down and sigh and look upon the ground for an hour or two together and this be still bad to me for if i could burst out into tear or vent myself by word it would go off and the grief have exhaust itself would abate but now i begin to exercise myself with new thought i daily read the word of god and apply all the comfort of it to my present state one morning be very sad i open the bible upon these word i will never never leave thee nor forsake thee immediately it occur that these word be to me why els should they be direct in such a manner just at the moment when i be mourn over my condition a one forsaken of god and man well then say i if god do not forsake me of what ill consequence can it be or what matter it though the world should all forsake me see on the other hand if i have all the world and should lose the favour and blessing of god there would be no comparison in the loss from this moment i begin to conclude in my mind that it be possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken solitary condition than it be probable i should have ever be in any other particular state in the world and with this thought i be go to give thanks to god for bring me to this place i know not what it be but something shocked my mind at that thought and i durst not speak the word how canst thou be such an hypocrite say i even audibly to pretend to be thankful for a condition which however thou mayst endeavour to be content with thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be deliver from so i stop there but though i could not say i thank god for be there yet i sincerely give thanks to god for open my eye by whatever afflict providence to see the former condition of my life and to mourn for my wickedness and repent i never open the bible or shut it but my very soul within me bless god for direct my friend in england without any order of mine to pack it up among my good and for assist me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship thus and in this disposition of mind i begin my third year and though i have not give the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my work this year as at the first yet in general it may be observe that i be very seldom idle have regularly divide my time accord to the several daily employment that be before me such a first my duty to god and read the scripture which i constantly set apart some time for thrice every day secondly the go abroad with my gun for food which generally take me up three hour every morning when it do not rain thirdly the order curing preserving and cook what i have kill or catch for my supply these take up great part of the day also it be to be consider that in the middle of the day when the sun be in the zenith the violence of the heat be too great to stir out so that about four hour in the evening be all the time i could be suppose to work in with this exception that sometimes i change my hour of hunt and working and go to work in the morning and abroad with my gun in the afternoon to this short time allow for labour i desire may be add the exceed laboriousness of my work the many hour which for want of tool want of help and want of skill every thing that i do take up out of my time for example i be full twoandforty day make me a board for a long shelf which i want in my cave whereas two sawyer with their tool and sawpit would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day my case be this it be to be a large tree which be to be cut down because my board be to be a broad one the tree i be three day a cut down and two more cut off the bough and reduce it to a log or piece of timber with inexpressible hacking and hewing i reduce both the side of it into chip till it begin to be light enough to move then i turn it and make one side of it smooth and flat a a board from end to end then turn that side downward cut the other side till i bring the plank to be about three inch thick and smooth on both side any one may judge the labour of my hand in such a piece of work but labour and patience carry me through that and many other thing i only observe this in particular to shew the reason why so much of my time go away with so little work viz that what might be a little to be do with help and tool be a vast labour and require a prodigious time to do alone and by hand but notwithstanding this with patience and labour i go through many thing and indeed ever thing that my circumstance make necessary for me to do as will appear by what follow i be now in the month of november and december expect my crop of barley and rice the ground i have manure or dig up for them be not great for a i observe my seed of each be not above the quantity of half a peck for i have lose one whole crop by sow in the dry season but now my crop promise very well when on a sudden i find i be in danger of lose it all again by enemy of several sort which it be scarce possible to keep from it a first the goat and wild creature which i call hare which taste the sweetness of the blade lay in it night and day as soon a it come up and eat it so close that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk this i saw no remedy for but by make an enclosure about it with a hedge which i do with a great deal of toil and the more because it require a great deal of speed the creature daily spoil my corn however a my arable land be but small suit to my crop i get it totally well fence in about three week time and shoot some of the creature in the daytime i set my dog to guard it in the night tie him up to a stake at the gate where he would stand and bark all night long so in a little time the enemy forsake the place and the corn grow very strong and well and begin to ripen apace but a the beast ruin me before while my corn be in the blade so the bird be as likely to ruin me now when it be in the ear for go along by the place to see how it thrive i saw my little crop surround with fowl of i know not how many sort which stand a it be watch till i should be go i immediately let fly among them for i always have my gun with me i have no sooner shot but there arise up a little cloud of fowl which i have not see at all from among the corn itself this touch me sensibly for i foresee that in a few day they would devour all my hope that i should be starve and never be able to raise a crop at all and what to do i could not tell however i resolve not to lose my corn if possible though i should watch it night and day in the first place i go among it to see what damage be already do and find they have spoil a good deal of it but that a it be yet too green for them the loss be not so great but the remainder be like to be a good crop if it could be save i stay by it to load my gun and then come away i could easily see the thief sit upon all the tree about me a if they only wait till i be go away and the event prove it to be so for a i walk off a if i be go i be no sooner out of their sight but they drop down one by one into the corn again i be so provoked that i could not have patience to stay till more come on know that every grain that they eat now be a it might be say a peck loaf to me in the consequence but come up to the hedge i fire again and kill three of them this be what i wish for so i take them up and serve them a we serve notorious thief in england viz hang them in chain for a terror to other it be impossible to imagine almost that this should have such an effect a it have for the fowl would not only not come at the corn but in short they forsake all that part of the island and i could never see a bird near the place as long a my scarecrow hang there this i be very glad of you may be sure and about the latter end of december which be our second harvest of the year i reap my corn i be sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down and all i could do be to make one as well a i could out of one of the broadsword or cutlass which i save among the arm out of the ship however a my crop be but small i have no great difficulty to cut it down in short i reap it my way for i cut nothing off but the ear and carry it away in a great basket which i have make and so rub it out with my hand and at the end of all my harvesting i find that out of my halfpeck of seed i have near two bushel of rice and above two bushel and a half of barley that be to say by my guess for i have no measure at that time however this be a great encouragement to me and i foresee that in time it would please god to supply me with bread and yet here i be perplex again for i neither know how to grind or make meal of my corn or indeed how to clean it and part it nor if make into meal how to make bread of it and if how to make it yet i know not how to bake it these thing be add to my desire of have a good quantity for store and to secure a constant supply i resolve not to taste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next season and in the meantime to employ all my study and hour of work to accomplish this great work of provide myself with corn and bread it might be truly say that i now work for my bread it be a little wonderful and what i believe few people have think much upon viz the strange multitude of little thing necessary in the provide produce cure dress making and finishing this one article of bread i that be reduce to a mere state of nature find this to be my daily discouragement and be make more and more sensible of it every hour even after i get the first handful of seed corn which a i have say come up unexpectedly and indeed to a surprise first i have no plough to turn the earth no spade or shovel to dig it well this i conquer by make a wooden spade a i observe before but this do my work but in a wooden manner and though it cost me a great many day to make it yet for want of iron it not only wear out the sooner but make my work the hard and make it be perform much bad however this i bore with too and be content to work it out with patience and bear with the badness of the performance when the corn be sow i have no harrow but be force to go over it myself and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it to scratch the earth a it may be call rather than rake or harrow it when it be grow or grow i have observe already how many thing i want to fence it secure it mow or reap it cure or carry it home thresh part it from the chaff and save it then i want a mill to grind it sieve to dress it yeast and salt to make it into bread and an oven to bake it in and all these thing i do without a shall be observe and yet the corn be an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too but all this a i say make every thing laborious and tedious to me but that there be no help for neither be my time so much loss to me because i have divide it a certain part of it be every day appoint to these work and a i resolve to use none of the corn for bread till i have a great quantity by me i have the next six month to apply myself wholly by labour and invention to furnish myself with utensils proper for the perform all the operation necessary for the make the corn when i have it fit for my use but first i be to prepare more land for i have now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground before i do this i have a week work at least to make me a spade which when it be do be a very sorry one indeed and very heavy and required double labour to work with it however i go through that and sow my seed in two large flat piece of ground a near my house a i could find them to my mind and fence them in with a good hedge the stake of which be all cut off that wood which i have set before which i know would grow so that in one year time i know i should have a quick or living hedge that would want but little repair this work be not so little a to take me up less than three month because great part of that time be in the wet season when i could not go abroad withindoor that be when it rain and i could not go out i find employment on the following occasion always observe that all the while i be at work i divert myself with talk to my parrot and teach him to speak and i quickly learn him to know hi own name at last to speak it out pretty loud pol which be the first word i ever hear speak in the island by any mouth but my own this therefore be not my work but an assistant to my work for now a i say i have a great employment upon my hand a follow viz i have long study by some mean or other to make myself some earthen vessel which indeed i want sorely but know not where to come at them however consider the heat of the climate i do not doubt but if i could find out any such clay i might botch up some such pot a might be dry by the sun be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling and to hold any thing that be dry and require to be keep so and a this be necessary in prepare corn meal c which be the thing i be upon i resolve to make some as large a i could and fit only to stand like jar to hold what should be put into them it would make the reader pity me or rather laugh at me to tell how many awkward way i look to raise this paste what odd misshapen ugly thing i make how many of them fell in and how many fell out the clay not be stiff enough to bear it own weight how many crack by the overviolent heat of the sun be set out too hastily and how many fell to piece with only remove as well before a after they be dry and in a word how after have labour hard to find the clay to dig it to temper it to bring it home and work it i could not make above two large earthen ugly thing i can not call them jar in about two month labour however a the sun bake these two very dry and hard i lift them very gently up and set them down again in two great wickerbaskets which i have make on purpose for them that they might not break and a between the pot and the basket there be a little room to spare i stuff it full of the rice and barleystraw and these two pot be to stand always dry i think would hold my dry corn and perhaps the meal when the corn be bruise though i miscarry so much in my design for large pot yet i make several small thing with good success such a little round pot flat dish pitcher and pipkins and any thing my hand turn to and the heat of the sun bake them strangely hard but all this would not answer my end which be to get an earthen pot to hold what be liquid and bear the fire which none of these could do it happen after some time make a pretty large fire for cook my meat when i go to put it out after i have do with it i find a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessel in the fire burnt as hard a a stone and red a a tile i be agreeably surprised to see it and say to myself that certainly they might be make to burn whole if they would burn break this set me to study how to order my fire so a to make it burn me some pot i have no notion of a kiln such a the potter burn in or of glaze them with lead though i have some lead to do it with but i place three large pipkins and two or three pot in a pile one upon another and place my firewood all round it with a great heap of ember under them i pile the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon the top till i saw the pot in the inside redhot quite through and observe that they do not crack at all when i saw them clear red i let them stand in that heat about five or six hour till i find one of them though it do not crack do melt or run for the sand which be mixed with the clay melt by the violence of the heat and would have run into glass if i have go on so i slack my fire gradually till the pot begin to abate of the red colour and watch them all night that i might not let the fire abate too fast in the morning i have three very good i will not say handsome pipkins and two other earthen pot a hard burnt a could be desire and one of them perfectly glaze with the running of the sand after this experiment i need not say that i want no sort of earthenware for my use but i must need say a to the shape of them they be very indifferent a any one may suppose when i have no way of make them but a the child make dirtpies or a a woman would make pie that never learn to raise paste no joy at a thing of so mean a nature be ever equal to mine when i find i have make an earthen pot that would bear the fire and i have hardly patience to stay till they be cold before i set one upon the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat which i do admirably well and with a piece of a kid i make some very good broth though i want oatmeal and several other ingredient requisite to make it so good a i would have have it my next concern be to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in for a to the mill there be no thought of arrive to that perfection of art with one pair of hand to supply this want i be at a great loss for of all trade in the world i be as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter a for any whatever neither have i any tool to go about it with i spend many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none at all except what be in the solid rock and which i have no way to dig or cut out nor indeed be the rock in the island of hardness sufficient but be all of a sandy crumbling stone which would neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle nor would break the corn without fill it with sand so after a great deal of time lose in search for a stone i give it over and resolve to look out a great block of hard wood which i find indeed much easy and get one as big a i have strength to stir i round it and form it on the outside with my axe and hatchet and then with the help of fire and infinitelabour make an hollow place in it a the indian in brasil make their canoe after this i make a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood call the ironwood and this i prepare and lay by against i have my next crop of corn when i propose to myself to grind or rather pound my corn or meal to make my bread my next difficulty be to make a sieve or searce to dress my meal and part it from the bran and the husk without which i do not see it possible i could have any bread this be a most difficult thing so much a but to think on for to be sure i have nothing like the necessary thing to make it with i mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through and here i be at a full stop for many month nor do i really know what to do linen i have none leave but what be mere rag i have goat hair but neither know i how to weave or spin it and have i know how here be no tool to work it with all the remedy that i find for this be that at last i do remember i have among the seaman clothes which be save out of the ship some neckcloth of calico or muslin and with some piece of these i make three small sieve but proper enough for the work and thus i make shift for some year how i do afterwards i shall shew in it place the bake part be the next thing to be consider and how i should make bread when i come to have corn for first i have no yeast a to that part there be no supply the want so i do not concern myself much about it but for an oven i be indeed in great pain at length i find out an experiment for that also which be this i make some earthen vessel very broad but not deep that be to say about two foot diameter and not above nine inch deep these i burn in the fire a i have do the other and lay them by and when i want to bake i make a great fire upon the hearth which i have pave with some square tile of my own making and burning also but i should not call them square when the firewood be burnt pretty much into ember or live coal i draw them forward upon this hearth so a to cover it all over and there i let them lie till the hearth be very hot then sweep away all the ember i set down my loaf or loaf and whelm down the earthen pot upon them draw the ember all round the outside of the pot to keep in and add to the heat and thus as well a in the best oven in the world i bake my barleyloaves and become in a little time a mere pastrycook into the bargain for i make myself several cake of the rice and pudding indeed i make no pie neither have i any thing to put into them suppose i have except the flesh either of fowl or goat it need not be wonder at if all these thing take me up most part of the third year of my abode here for it be to be observe that in the interval of these thing i have my new harvest and husbandry to manage for i reap my corn in it season and carry it home as well a i could and lay it up in the ear in my large basket till i have time to rub it out for i have no floor to thresh it on or instrument to thresh it with and now indeed my stock of corn increase i really want to build my barn big i want a place to lay it up in for the increase of the corn now yield me so much that i have of the barley about twenty bushel and of the rice as much or more insomuch that i now resolve to begin to use it freely for my bread have be quite go a great while also i resolve to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year and to sow but once a year upon the whole i find that the forty bushel of barley and rice be much more than i could consume in a year so i resolve to sow just the same quantity every year that i sow the last in hope that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread c all the while these thing be do you may be sure my thought run many time upon the prospect of land which i have see from the other side of the island and i be not without secret wish that i be on shore there fancy that see the main land and an inhabited country i might find some way or other to convey myself far and perhaps at last find some mean of escape but all this while i make no allowance for the danger of such a condition and how i might fall into the hand of savage and perhaps such a i might have reason to think far bad than the lion and tiger of africa that if i once come into their power i should run an hazard more than a thousand to one of be kill and perhaps of be eat for i have hear that the people of the caribean coast be cannibal or meneaters and i know by the latitude that i could not be far off from that shore that suppose they be not cannibals yet they might kill me a many european who have fall into their hand have be serve even when they have be ten or twenty together much more i that be but one and could make little or no defence all these thing i say which i ought to have consider well of and i do cast up in my thought afterwards yet take none of my apprehension at first and my head run mightily upon the thought of get over to that shore now i wish for my boy xury and the longboat with the shoulder of mutton sail with which i sail above a thousand mile on the coast of africa but this be in vain then i think i would go and look on our ship boat which a i have say be blow up upon the shore a great way in the storm when we be first cast away she lay almost where she do at first but not quite and be turn by the force of the wave and the wind almost bottom upwards against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand but no water about her a before if i have have hand to have refit her and have launch her into the water the boat would have do well enough and i might have go back into the brasil with her easy enough but i might have easily foreseen that i could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom than i could remove the island however i go to the wood and cut lever and roller and bring them to the boat resolving to try what i could do suggest to myself that if i could but turn her down i might easily repair the damage she have receive and she would be a very good boat and i might go to sea in her very easily i spar no pain indeed in this piece of fruitless toil and spent i think three or four week about it at last find it impossible to heave it up with my little strength i fell to dig away the sand to undermine it and so to make it fall down set piece of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall but when i have do this i be unable to stir it up again or to get under it much less to move it forwards towards the water so i be force to give it over and yet though i give over the hope of the boat my desire to venture over for the main increase rather than decrease a the mean for it seem impossible this at length set me upon think whether it be not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua such a the native of those climate make even without tool or a i might say without hand viz of the trunk of a great tree this i not only thought possible but easy and pleased myself extremely with my thought of make it and with my have much more convenience for it than any of the negro or indian but not at all consider the particular inconvenience which i lay under more than the indian do viz want of hand to move it into the water when it be make a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the consequence of want of tool could be to them for what be it to me that when i have choose a vast tree in the wood i might with great trouble cut it down if after i might be able with my tool to hew and dub the outside into a proper shape of a boat and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow so to make a boat of it if after all this i must leave it just there where i find it and be not able to launch it into the water one would have think i could not have have the least reflection upon my mind of this circumstance while i be make this boat but i should have immediately think how i should get it into the sea but my thought be so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it that i never once consider how i should get it off the land and it be really in it own nature more easy for me to guide it over fortyfive mile of sea than about fortyfive fathom of land where it lay to set it afloat in the water i go to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man do who have any of hi sens awake i please myself with the design without determine whether i be ever able to undertake it not but that the difficulty of launch my boat come often into my head but i put a stop to my own inquiry into it by this foolish answer which i give myself let me first make it ill warrant ill find some way or other to get it along when it be do this be a most preposterous method but the eagerness of my fancy prevail and to work i go and fell a cedartree i question much whether solomon ever have such an one for the building the temple at jerusalem it be five foot ten inch diameter at the low part next the stump and four foot eleven inch diameter at the end of twentytwo foot after which it lessen for a while and then part into branch it be not without infinite
