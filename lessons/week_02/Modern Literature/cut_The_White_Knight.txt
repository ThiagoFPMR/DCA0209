men dead he mount a horse and flee he take shelter in a castle he have take name killingworth together with all those who have escape the camp and they recover their resolve he and all the other moor be astonish at how they have be defeat and they could not understand what have cause such a great disaster because their force be fifty time great than those of the christian when the moor flee the christian pillage their camp and day be upon them when they enter the city victoriously after four day have pass the moorish king send hi emissary with a letter challenge the king of england and it say the follow to you christian king who rule the isle of england i abraim king and lord of canaria say that if you wish the war between you and me to end and the kill between your people and mine to cease let u have a joust king against king under the following pact and agreement if i should defeat you you will hold all england under my power and command and you shall give me two hundred thousand piece of gold in tribute each year and if fortune decides that you be the conqueror i shall return to my own land and you will remain in yours in peace and you and all your people will enjoy full peace and tranquility and in addition i shall restore to you all the city and castle that i have win and conquer by my own victorious hand these word be not speak for vainglory or out of disdain for the royal crown but so that god who be great may give to each that share which by hi merit he will deserve two great moorish knight whom the king of canary be send to the city of warwick a envoy to the king of england leave the castle of killingworth and before they depart they send a messenger to the city to request safe conduct when the messenger come to the gate of the city the guard tell him to wait a little while and they would return with the reply one of the guard quickly go to the king to tell him after the king have hold a brief counsel he tell the guard to let him in when the messenger be inside the city the count of salisbury speak to him and say messenger on behalf of hi majesty the king i can tell you that the envoy may come without danger and in safety for they will not be harm in any wayand the count give him a silk garment and one hundred piece of gold the messenger depart very content and before the envoy come the hermit say to the king my lord let u put fear into the heart of these moor your majesty should order two grandee to go out to the gate and receive the envoy and let many men very well arm but without helmet go with them have three hundred men at the gate to guard it arm like the other and let all the lady and maiden who be able old as well a young hang banner in the window and on the roof as tall a the woman chest and each of these woman should put armor on her head when the envoy pas by they will see the coat of mail shining and will think they be all warrior have the three hundred guard the gate follow them by other street and let them appear in the square and on the corner then after the envoy have pass by let them do the same again and again until they reach your highness and you may be sure that they will be frighten when they see so many soldier after the battle they have lose see the great number of men they will believe that many have come from spain or france or germany to help u the king and all hi council think very highly of the hermit word it be decide that the duke of lancaster and the count of salisbury should receive the envoy and that four thousand men should go with them each wear a garland of flower on hi head they go a good mile out of the city to receive the envoy then the duke of bedford say tell u father since there be so many ceremony to be perform for the envoys how should they find the king clothe or naked arm or unarm that would be a good question say the hermit if there be not so much anger behind your word but i see the meaning of your word and that they be intend more for malice than good it be because i be old and a hermit that you be try to besmear my advice and belittle me before my lord the king hold your tongue if you do not i shall put a bridle in your mouth that will make you stop at every turn at this the duke rise to hi foot draw hi sword and say if it be not because you be so old and you wear the habit of saint francis i would take this sword and cut your skirt right up to the waist then the king rise angrily to hi foot seize the duke and take the sword out of hi hand and have him imprison in the tower all the other noble lord there calm the hermit tell him that because of hi age and the habit he wear he should be forgive and he be content to forgive but the king would not in spite of all the plea of the hermit and the other noble lord in the midst of these trouble news be bring to the king that the moorish envoy be approach and those who have be choose go out quickly a they have arrange when the envoy stand before the king they give him the letter and the king command that it be read in everyones presence the hermit draw near to the king and say to him your highness accept the challenge then the king say i agree to the battle in accordance with the condition your king set down he beg the envoy to remain there until the following day when he would give them the formal reply he show them to very comfortable chamber and give them everything they need then the king convoke a general council and while it be be prepare the hermit along with the other lord go to the king he kneel at the king foot and kiss hi hand and foot and very humbly beg him to give him the key to the tower so that he could release the duke the hermit plead so much a do the other lord that the king be oblige to give them to him then the hermit go with the other to the tower where the duke be imprison and there they find a friar hear hi confession because he be certain he would be kill when he hear the door open he be so startled that he felt he be lose hi mind for he think they be come to take him out to execute him when the hermit saw him he say my lord duke if you and i have speak harmful word to each other i beg you to forgive me for i most willingly pardon you when they have make their peace they all return to the council where the king and all the duke count and marquis be and they read the letter from the moorish king once more because the king and all the other love and revere the hermit and they saw that he lead a saintly life and that he express himself well and be knowledgeable about arm they all agree that he should be the first to speak and this lead to the following discourse i will tell you my opinion although i realize that i be not worthy to speak of such thing since i know little of the use of arm because of the weak disposition of my lord the king who be young and have a weak constitution and be sickly although he have the courage of a virtuous knight it would not be fit or just for him to do battle with a man as robust a the moorish king instead let the duke of lancaster who be the uncle of my lord king undertake this battle and let our king grant to him the scepter and the royal crown so that the moorish king will not be deceive and so that he may combat a true king scarcely have the hermit speak these last word when three duke spring to their foot in great anger the duke of gloucester the duke of bedford and the duke of exeter and they begin to cry loudly that they would not consent for the duke of lancaster to enter into battle and be make king because each of them be more closely relate to the king and it be more just for them to do battle than the duke of lancaster the king would not permit any further discussion and he say it be not my pleasure that any of you should take my place in battle since i have accept i wish to carry it out alone a baron stand up and say the following sire may your excellency forgive me for what i be about to say we will never consent to what your highness have say if our heavenly father have indeed give you the desire he have take from you the strength we all know that your highness be not ready for such a formidable and arduous battle a this will be let your grace be rule by our counsel and will if we believe that your excellency be dispose for such an undertaking we would very willingly have agree to what your highness have command all the other baron and knight praise what this baron have say my most faithful vassal and subject say the king since it be not to your liking and you see that i be not fit to combat the moorish king i give you my thanks for the great love you have show me and i submit to your will but it be my wish and my command that no one under pain of death shall be so bold a to say that he will take my place in battle except the one i shall choose unto him i shall give the crown the kingdom and the royal scepter then the king say duke count and marquis and all the rest of my most faithful subject i be relinquish my station the scepter and the royal crown and my title to my beloved father hermit he remove the garment and say a i relinquish these royal robe and put them on the father hermit in the same wayi relinquish my throne and my station to him i beg him to accept and to do battle for me with the moorish king when the hermit hear the king say these word he arise quickly because he wish to speak and all the great lord who be there also stand and gather so closely to the hermit that they would not let him speak but instead remove the habit he be clothe in and make him dress in the royal robe a the king turn over all hi power to the hermit it be duly note in the presence of all the council and with the consent of all the baron when the hermit king hear the plea of all those in the council he accept the kingdom and the battle and quickly ask them to bring him armor that would fit him well they bring him many suit of armor but of all the one they bring him there be none he be pleased with in faith say the hermit king nothing will stop this battle even if i have to go dress in only my shirt i beg you my lord say the hermit king to be so good a to go to the countess and entreat her by her great virtue and kindness to lend me the armor of her husband sir william of warwick which he wear when he go into battle when the countess saw so many duke count and marquis and the entire council of the king approaching and she hear the reason they have come the virtuous countess give them a suit of armor of little value when the king saw it he say this be not the one i ask for there be another that be much well all the baron return once more to the countess and ask for the other armor and the countess tell them that there be no other when the king hear the answer he say my lord and my brother let u all go and we shall try our luck when they be all before the countess the king say countess out of your great kindness and gentility i beg you to lend me the armor of your husband sir william of warwick sire say the countess may god take this child from me for i have no other dear thing in the world i have already send the armor to you that be true say the king but this be not what i ask for

camp well guard and he allow no one to take off their armor in the morning when the sun come out he have the trumpet sound and they move the camp to within half a league of where the moor be when the tent be set up he let the men rest this happen after the noon hour when the moor learn that the christian have come out of the city they be astonish because a short time before they have not dare take a step outside the city and now they come look for them some captain say this be because of the great cruelty of their king calebencale who have kill the christian ambassador so cruelly and they say that they might be recruit men from spain or france that be why they be come so near and you can be sure that any of u they capture will be cut to shred one of the ambassador who have take the letter to convene the joust say they pay u many honor and as soon a we be in the city we saw great number of men in the tower the square in the window and on the rooftop it be astonish to see so many arm men by mohammed i would guess there be two hundred thousand soldier and this wicked king kill their ambassador without reason after all the captain have hear the word of this ambassador they talk to the other moor who have go into the city with him and when they know the truth of the situation they kill calebencale and choose a new king nonetheless they arm themselves for battle and go in sight of the christian the sun be nearly down but they still decide to go up a nearby hill when the hermit king saw them he say in faith theyre afraid of u thats why theyve go up to such a high place let everyone do what i do and with divine help we will have vengeance on our enemy he take a basket in one hand and a spade in the other and go in front of them all when the great lord saw the king do this each of them do the same and follow him before leave the city the virtuous king have procure everything necessary for the war around the palisade he dig a deep ditch that lead to a large water hole and they leave a great entryway in the middle through which one hundred fifty men could pass at one time on the other side they dig another ditch that lead to a high cliff the king say since weve finish and there be only two hour leave till dawn you duke of gloucester and you count of salisbury go quickly to the countess and ask her to give me two large barrel that belong to william of warwick they be full of copper spike and she will find them upstairs in the weapon room they go there quickly and beg and command her on the king behalf so that she give them to them even though she be upset with the king because he have not give her son back to her but she realize how great their need be and so she do it although she could not help say lord have mercy on me whats go on that this king

onto cart and take them to the camp when they be before the king they tell him everything the countess have say and the virtuous king burst out laughing and he smile and joke with them at length afterward he have the spike take to the gate and they place them on the ground so that when the moor come through they would stick into their foot he also have many hole like well dig so that if they escape one danger they would fall into another and the christian work at this all night long when daylight break the moor begin to beat drum and they blow trumpet and pipe and shout their battlecries and with great joy they stream down the mountain to attack the christian the hermit king order all the men to lie down on the ground and pretend to be asleep when they be almost within range of bombard they all get up and give sign of be unprepared for battle when the moor be inside the entryway the king say gentleman do not dismay i beg you let turn our back and pretend to run away when the moor saw them flee they rush forward as quickly a they could they run inside the entryway which a we have mention they could not pass through because the copper spike stick into their foot when the virtuous hermit king saw the moor inside the entryway he make hi men slow down like an expert in war and weaponry and he saw the moor stop because of the wound from the spike while other be fall into the well that be cover by branch with dirt pile on top then the king begin to shout with a loud voice oh knight of honor take your eye from the city and turn your face to the enemy of the christian faith let u attack with great courage for this day be ours give them a cruel battle and grant mercy to no one the king be the first to strike a blow then the other follow the moor saw the christian do

mine and the knight stand there argue about ceremony the judge pick up the weapon to put an end to the dispute he put some of them on the right side and the other on the left then he pick up two straws one of them long and the other short the judge say whoever get the long one take the weapon on the right and whoever get the short one the weapon on the left when they have each pick up the weapon they quickly take off all their clothes and put on the painful shirt that could well be call haircloth of sorrow the judge make two line on the field and he place one of the men on one line and the other man on the other and he order them not to move until he say to they cut a tree branch so that the judge could be on a sort of cenotaph when everything be ready the judge go to lord vilesermes and say i be judge by the authority you have give to me and it be my duty to warn you and beseech you not to come to such a narrow strait a this remember god and dont die so desperately a you know the justice of our lord do not pardon a man who bring on hi own death and he be condemn for all eternity let stop all the talk now say the knight each of u know hi worth and what he can do both in the temporal life and in the spiritual one have tirant come here to me and it might be possible for u to come to an understanding i dont think that what youre ask be reasonable say the judge you be equal why should he come to you but in any case jerusalem go and ask tirant if he want to come and talk to this knight jerusalem go to tirant and ask him if he want to go there tirant answer if the judge be command me to go i will but for that knight over there i wouldnt take a step backward or forward for everything he worth jerusalem tell him how the judge be obligate to do everything possible to make peace between the knight then tirant say jerusalem tell the knight that i see no reason why i should have to go to him if he want something from me let him come here he take the answer to him and then the judge say all right it seem to me that tirant be do what he should do but knight you can go to the middle of the field and tirant will come there so it be do that waywhen they be face each other lord vilesermessaid tirant if you want to have peace with me and if you want me to forgive you because of your youth ill do iton condition that you hand over the bauble of that illustrious lady dona agnes of berri to me along with the knife and the paper shield so that i can show it to the lady because you know very well that youre not worthy of have anything at all from such a lofty and virtuous lady a she be your station lineage and condition arent good enough even to allow you to take off her left slipper theyre not even enough to raise you to my rank in fact it be out of kindness that i decide to do combat with you knight say tirant im not unaware of who you be or what you can do but this be not the time or place for u to discuss the merit of our lineage i be tirant lo blanc when a sword be in my hand no king duke count or marquis can deny me that be know throughout the world but anyone can easily find the seven capital sin in you let go to battle and do what we come here for and let not go on with unnecessary and worthless word if even one of my hair fell to the ground i wouldnt surrender it to you much less allow you to pick it up since you dont want to reach an agreement say the judge do you want life or death lord vilesermes say i be very sorry about the death of this haughty young man let go to battle and let each one go back to hi place the judge get up on the cenotaph that have be make with branch and he shout go now knight and let each of you act like a valiant and good knight they go at each other in a fury the french knight carry hi knife high in front of hi head and tirant hold hi just above hi chest when they be close to each other the french knight strike hard at the middle of tirants head tirant parry and strike back and he deal him a blow on top of hi ear that almost dig into hi brain the other man strike tirant in the middle of hi thigh and the wound gap about a handsbreadth he quickly stab him again in hi left arm and the knife sunk in as far a the bone they both fight so hard that it be dreadful and they be so close to each other that with every swing they take they draw blood it be a pitiful sight for anyone who saw the wound of the two men their shirt have become completely red from all the blood they lose jerusalem repeatedly ask the judge if he want him to make them stop fighting and the cruel judge answer let them come to the end of their cruel day since thats what they want i be convince that at that very moment both of them would rather have have peace than war but since they be very brave and very courageous knight they fight ceaselessly without mercy finally tirant saw that he be near death because of all the blood he be lose so he draw as close to the other man a he could and stab him in the left breast straight into hi heart the other man deal him a mighty slash to hi head cause him to lose the sight of hi eye and he fell to the ground before the other one and if the frenchman have be able to hold himself up when tirant fell he could easily have kill him if he have want but he do not have enough strength and he immediately fell dead on the ground when the judge saw that the knight be lie there so still he get down from the cenotaph and go up to them he say upon my word you two have behave like good and very honorable knight no one could find fault with you and he make the sign of the cross twice over each of them and take two stick he make a cross and lay it over the two body then he say i see that tirants eye be still open a little and if he isnt dead he very near

vincent to pass through the strait of gibraltar there they encounter many moorish vessel and when they saw the ship all the vessel go into formation they attack it fiercely and the combat last half a day with many men from both side die after tirants men have rest they renew the battle and it be very fierce now tirants ship be much large and light than any of those of the moor but it be alone while there be fifteen of the other large and small and all of them carry weapon one very able sailor on the ship name cataquefaras have sail a great deal and he be very clever and valiant when he saw that the situation be take a turn for the worse he take many rope from the ship and make a net he place those rope from stern to prow and around the mast and he put them up so high that the men do not find their weapon hinder in any wayinstead it keep them from be take prisoner for the missile that the moor launch be so many and so thick that it be a great marvel to see and if the ship have not be cover by that net of rope it would have be completely fill with stone and iron bar in that wayit be protect so that no stone could pass through it instead when a stone hit against the rope it bounce into the sea what els do this sailor do he take up all the mattress that he find on the ship and he cover the forecastle and the side of the ship and a the missile fell on top of the mat they could not damage the ship and he do still more he take boil oil and tar and when the ship draw alongside they throw the oil and boiling tar with ladle cause grave injury to the moor who have to draw apart from the ship but still they pass through the entire strait of gibraltar fight night and day there be so many missile dart and spike that the sail be pin to the ship mast when the moor leave them they be very near land and certain that the ship would run aground stern first near the city of gibraltar but the sailor be so capable that they quickly put the ship around and raise the sail then they pass out of the strait and enter the great sea philippe tirant and many other be wound in these battle they go to a desert island near the land of the moor and there they tend to their wound and

when the ship be in port they make a scribe disembark along with five or six men with order to tell no one about philippe or tirant but rather to say that their ship have come from the west and be on it wayto alexandria with some pilgrim who be go to the holy sepulcher when the king learn that they have come from the west he have the scribe from the ship and all the other call before hi majesty so he could have news of those land before the king they tell about the great battle they have have with the moor and genoese in the strait of gibraltar and forget at that moment tirants word they

do it most willingly even if it should be to carry the cross on my back the queen give him many thanks tirant take leave of the queen and the infanta and when he be at hi lodging he be sorry that the

they tell him that this ship come from alexandria and beirut and that it have touch on the island of cyprus but that it have not be able to land at rhodes because there be so many moor that hold it besiege on land and sea many genoese vessel be guard the port and the city of rhodes be in such strait that they have no bread to eat it have be three month now since the grand master or anyone in the castle or the city have eat they eat nothing but horse meat and the day they could find even that be a fortunate one they truly believe that in a few short day they would have to surrender to the moor when tirant hear this news he reflect at length and he decide to load the ship entirely with wheat and other victual and embark to give aid to rhodes he quickly send for merchant and he give them so much money that they load the ship with wheat wine and salt meat when the king learn of this he send for tirant and say the glory of your undertaking put all the prince of christianity to shame who

look on her face she say to him dont bother yourself about be at philippes skirt all the time tirant in my father the king house there be enough knight to serve him so that you dont have to do it when tirant hear the infanta speaking so heatedly and saw that he have to leave he put hi mouth to philippes ear and say to him when water be bring to the king and you see the infanta get up and then kneel and hold the vessel for him you do what she do and be careful not to do anything gauche he say that he would and tirant leave him when they be all seat the king water bowel be bring and the infanta knelt and hold the laver philippe try to do the same but the king would not allow it and the same happen with the queen when it be the infantas time to wash she take philippes hand so that they could

bread be bring and place before the king and the other and no one touch it a they wait for the dinner to be bring when philippe saw the bread before him he quickly take a knife and pick up a loaf of bread he cut through it and make twelve large piece when the infanta saw such a sight she could not contain her laughter the king and everyone there include the serving boy make great sport of philippe and since the infanta be laugh too it be inevitable that it should come to tirants attention because he do not take hi eye from philippe for a moment stand up he run from the table and say by heaven philippe must have stain hi honor with some great foolishness he go to hi side at the king table and saw the slice of bread that philippe have cut when he saw that neither the king nor anyone

tradition before any of their child enter the order of chivalry they be not allow to eat the first loaf of bread that be put in front of them at dinner until they have cut it into twelve slice and place a silver real on each one and have give it to the poor in memory of the twelve apostle then after the order of chivalry have be bestow on them they would put a piece of gold on each slice and even down to today everyone in the house of france continue the custom and my lord thats why philippe cut the bread and make twelve slice one for each apostle praise god say the king that sort of charity be the most beautiful ive ever heard of im a crowned king and i dont give a much in alms in a month dinner come and the infanta tell tirant to go back and eat philippe saw what he have do

ship a be in the port the ship approach and a it draw near it unfurl all it sail this and the shape of the ship make the genoese realize that it be not one of theirs and they hurry to prepare to attack but the ship be so close that none of their ship have time to raise their sail and this ship swiftly sail through all of them at full mast however they use lance spike and bombard and all the weapon use at sea then tirant order the helmsman and the pilot not to turn the ship but to head the prow straight into land and they do at full speed when the people in the city saw the ship beach itself they think it be the genoese come to take the city all the men run there and bravely attack it they be also be attack by the ship at sea and they be in dire strait until a sailor quickly take one of tirants flag and raise it when the people from the city saw the flag they stop fight then one of the men tell them that the ship have come to help them hear that the captain of the ship be

gift for the sultan of many different kind of food in order to make him lose any hope he have of take u by hunger all the great lord praise the old knight advice and the order be immediately give to

present he say to hi men damn this present and the traitor who send it this will bring the perdition of my honor and will be my ruin when it be nearly midnight and very dark the sailor have everything ready to set the captain ship on fire and he do it this waythe sailor have fix a very strong capstan into the ground near the sea then he put a thick rope in a boat along with a hemp cord as thick a a man finger he get into the boat and two men row for him when they be so near the ship that they could hear the men on the poop deck talk they stop row he take off all hi clothes and tie a cord around hi waist then he take a very sharp knife so that he could cut any cord he need to and he put it in back of him so it wouldnt bother him when he swim he attach one end of the cord to the knife sheath and he tell the men in the boat to keep feed him line when everything be ready he slip into the water and swam until he be so close to the ship that he could hear the men on watch talk then he swim underwater so that no one would see him and he reach the rudder he loop the cord through an iron ring under the rudder and swam underwater back to hi boat he take the end of the cord and tie it to one end of the thick rope and he hold it up and grease it thoroughly then he take a chunk of grease for the bar to let it slide through easily and noiselessly finally he give order to the men and swim back to the ship and grease the bar the men on the boat stick an iron pin through the cord and pull until the pin caught on the ring and the sailor know that the other end of the rope be in the boat when he think it be time they row back to land he tie one end of the rope to the capstan and the other end be tie to a large boat a type of whale boat that have be fill with firewood and candlewood all soak with oil so it would burn well they set it afire and let it catch well then one hundred men be set at the capstan and they begin to turn it with all their strength and with the power from the capstan it all happen so quickly that the large boat have barely start to move when suddenly it be flush against the side of the ship with the huge fire on it send out enormous tongue of flame it quickly set fire to the ship with such a fury that nothing in the world could have put it out the men on the ship think only of get away in small boat other throw themselves into the sea to swim to the other ship while many be burn to death because they do not have time enough to get off and the fire catch many other sleep when it be daylight tirant take three thousand crown and give them to the sailor along with a silk garment line with marten and a brocade doublet the sailor thank him very much and be very pleased then the sultan summon hi captain both on sea and land he tell them what have happen and also about the present the grand master have send him to show how well supply the city be with everything it need and more and a winter be set in the cold weather and rain be begin to bother them so they decide to raise camp and go back but with the intention of return another year he quickly order the camp trumpet and pipe to play and the ship to raise their sail and come near the island because he would be there to get all the men when tirant saw the moor raise camp he arm himself and with all hi men he leave the city and go to the camp he set fire to the palisade and hut so that if they come back they would have to build them again then the sultan set sail and return to hi land the lord there be well inform about the reason he be return and they go together to see him they take him prisoner and put him in a lion den where he die horribly then they choose another sultan the new sultan order all the genoese ship to form a large armada with all the men who have come

that my fortune have always be adverse now if i take this man for a husband and he turn out not to please me i would find myself have to do very desperate thing because it be my opinion that it good

than gauche thats be hi reputation wherever weve go among knight duenna and maiden even the moorish woman who saw him love him and want to serve him if you doubt it look at hi face hi hand hi foot and

dont have him by your side in a bed perfume with benjamin civet and pure musk and on the following day if you complain to me about him i will suffer whatever torment your highness decide oh tirant say the princess i would be very happy if i could have someone who would please me but what use would it be if i have a statue at my side who could only give me pain and desperation at this moment they reach the palace and find the king in the hall speaking with the ambassador from france when he saw hi daughter he take her by the hand and ask where she have be dinner be ready and philippe and the ambassador take their leave of the king and the infanta and go to their chamber after dinner they begin to dance and the infanta purposefully cause the dancing to continue until late at night the king

that night and to sleep in the palace with her brother the infant the king answer that that be agreeable to him after the king have leave the dancing end and the infant beg philippe to stay there that night to sleep because most of the night be already past philippe answer that he be deeply grateful but that he would go to hi lodging the infanta take hold of hi clothes and say since it be my

wont be necessary tirant say the infanta because in the house of my father my brother the infant and myself there will be no lack of people to serve him see how angrily she speak tirant realize that they do not want him and he leave with the other for hi lodge when they have go two page come with torch and ask philippe if it be hi desire to go to sleep and he answer that he would do whatever hi lady the infanta and her brother command they say that it be time now philippe bow to the infanta and follow the page who lead him to a room where there be two bed the king have order a very special canopy make entirely of brocade to be give to hi daughter on her wedding day and he have another place in a room to serve a it model when the brocade canopy be finish the two bed be place next to each other and the coverlet be of the same brocade and on it they put the sheet for the wedding with embroidered pillow so that it be an exceptional bed the other bed in the same room be entirely white and there be a great difference between the two when philippe saw such a luxurious bed he be astonish and he think it good to lie down on the other one that even while dance he have slightly tear hi stocking and he think that hi servant would not come as soon a he would get up in the morning the page have be well instruct by the infanta who be in a place where she could see very well what philippe would do philippe say to one of the page please go bring me a needle and a little bit of white thread the infanta have see him give order to the page but she do not know what he be ask for then the page go to the infanta and she have them give him a needle with a little thread the page take it to him and find him pace from one end of the room to the other and he do not say one word to the second page who be there when philippe have the needle he go to a torch and open a blister that be on hi hand the infanta immediately think he have ask for the needle because of the blister he put it on the bed where he have decide to sleep philippe then take off hi clothing and sit on the bed after the page have remove hi stocking philippe tell them to go to sleep and to leave a torch lit for him they do so close the door philippe get up from where he be sit in order to get the needle and sew hi stocking and he begin to look for it from one end of the bed to another he gloomily lift the coverlet and he twist and turn it so much that it fell on the floor then he lift up the sheet and tear the entire bed apart without find the needle he think about make up the bed again and sleep in it but when he saw it all undone he say to himself oh well wont it be well for me to sleep in the other one instead of make this one up again a very singular needle be that for philippe he lay down in the bed of rich cover the infanta who have see the entire display say to her maiden upon your life look how great the knowledge of foreigner be especially philippe it be my intention to test him a i have do other time with these two bed i think that if philippe be gauche and avaricious he would not dare sleep in a bed like this one but instead would lie down in the other which be more plain he have do something quite different he have tear apart the plain one and have throw it cover on the floor and he have go to bed in the best one to show that he be the son of a king now i can see that tirant be a loyal knight who have always tell me the truth and with this thought she leave to go to bed very early in the morning tenebroso come to philippes chamber with hi page and bring him more clothing so that he could change when the infanta be dress and still fasten her skirt she send for tirant and with a show of great happiness she tell him i have come to realize how special philippe be i have see with my own eye hi speech and royal manner and that he be very generous until now i felt very hesitant about give my consent to this marriage but from now on i will do everything hi royal majesty my father command me tirant hear the infantas word and he be the happy man in the world he quickly answer i be very happy that your excellency have come to know the truth i be go to speak with my lord the king immediately in order to bring the matter to a swift conclusion tirant take hi leave of the infanta and go to the king and tell him i see the ambassador from france in great anguish about this wedding so i have come to your majesty to beg you to either have it take place or give the ambassador your leave so that they can return to their king and if it will not make your majesty angry to have me speak with my lady the infanta on your highness behalf i believe that she will be incline to do whatever your majesty command if god give health to my soul and my body say the king that will please me i beg you to go to her and make the request on my behalf and your own tirant leave the king and go back to the infanta he find her comb her hair and he tell her about the conversation he have have with the king then the infanta say my lord tirant i have complete confidence in your nobility and virtue so i be put this entire matter in your hand and i will agree to everything if you want it do now i will do it tirant saw how willing she be and he saw philippe at the door wait to accompany the infanta to mass he ask the infanta to have the maiden leave because he want to tell her other thing in philippes presence the infanta order the maiden to go and they be very surprised to see the infanta speaking so docilely to tirant when all the maiden be go tirant open the door to the chamber and have philippe enter my lady say tirant here be philippe who have a great desire to serve your ladyship than all the princess in the world and so i beg your grace here on my knee to kiss him a a sign of good faith oh tirant say the infanta these be the word you want to tell me your face reveal what you bear in your heart when my king and my father command it of me then i

lady how can philippe be an enemy to your excellency if he love you more than hi own life and desire to hold you in that bed where he sleep this evening completely nude or in your chemise you can be certain that this would be the great blessing in the world so my lady continue tirant allow philippe who be die of love for you to enjoy part of the glory that he have desire so much may god not permit it say the infanta and may he keep me from an error like that i would think of myself a vile if i give my consent to such a thing my lady say tirant philippe and i be here only to serve you let

captaingeneral of this armada that i will be the first to touch land and the last to return afterward diafebus vow to write hi name on the gate to the city of tripoli then another knight make a vow that he would go so near the wall that he would put an arrow inside the city another knight stand up and vow that he would enter the city and take a moorish maiden from her mother side that he would put her on the ship and give her to philippa the daughter of the king of france another knight vow that he would place a flag on the high tower in the city on the king ship there be many knightsmore than four hundred fifty and where there be many envy and ill will be engender for the sin of envy have many branch many be move by the desire to make tirant break hi vow and they make preparation with boat and vessel and small galley to be the first to reach land there be so many moor that when they saw such a great armada they position themselves near the sea to stop the christian from reach land all the galley press forward toward land and they be so close that their side nearly touch when they be so near to land that they could throw down the ladder all the ship turn about so the men could disembark but tirant order hi galley to head in to land prow first when he felt the ship touch land tirant who be stand arm on the prow jump into the water the moor saw him and run toward him to kill him but diafebus and other defend him many arm men and many sailor leap after him in order to go to hi aid as soon a the king galley and the other have turn about they lower their ladder but who dare disembark when they saw so many moor the great fight be where tirant stand virtue goodness strength and wisdom be in the king and hi men who a valiant knight climb down the ladder and their haste to attack the moor be so great that many fell into the sea when all the men be on land they give the moor great battle and many men from both side die as soon a the moor attempt to take refuge in the city many good knight go in and take five street of the city but they be unable to take more all the knight fulfil their vow on those five street that they take and they load the ship and the galley with the great booty that they have take but so great be the aid that the moor receive that they could not push on when they have to withdraw therein lay the great danger and many of them die when they be all on board tirant remain behind because he have not yet fulfil hi vow hi galley have now debeached and it ladder be on land wait for tirant to board a knight who be search for honor and who well deserve it for hi virtue be name ricart lo venturos and he remain behind with tirant ricart say to tirant all the men be on board or be dead only you and i be still here you have the glory of be the first of the conqueror because your foot be the first to touch this cursed land but dont forget how i defend you many time from danger let me go on board the galley first so that we can be equal in honor and fame and brotherhood for at time a person who want all worldly glory loses everything there be no time to waste on word say tirant life or death be in your hand i will be consider victorious if both of u die at the hand of these infidel and im sure that our soul will be save if we die with our faith firm like good christian defend ourselves so give me your hand ricart and let u die like knight the two knight be in the sea up to their chest because of the lance dart spear and stone that be be hurl at them when ricart saw that tirant be go up to the shore to attack the moor he catch him by the coat and bring him back into the water and say i know of no knight in the world as fearless a you be and since i see how great your courage be do this put your foot on the ladder first and then i will be first to climb up the king be in great anguish afraid that those two knight would be lose tirant want to give him part of the honor so he put hi right foot on the ladder then ricart go up first and tirant be the last of all and so he fulfil hi vow there be much discussion about these two knight some say that tirant have fulfil hi vow and the king and many other pay him high honor when ricart saw that they all be honor tirant he say if the matter be duly judge by the code of chivalry who should the honor and glory be give to if not to me tirant be a coward in battle even when fortune aid him so the prize for this act should be give to no one but me i be barefoot and i will never again put shoe on my foot until hi majesty the king and the noble knight make a decision about this it be well know that after all the men have retreat tirant and i stay behind alone on the shore he and i argue at length about who would be the first to go on board when he saw that i do not want to he put hi foot on the ladder before i do and so my lord may it please your highness to summon your sacred council and let your majesty give the honor to the one it belong to a it rightfully and justly belongs to me and if your highness do not want to judge this case i say in the presence of everyone that i be a good knight than tirant and i will fight him man to man to the death the king answer ricart no good judge can decide anything if he do not listen to all side first and this can not be do without tirant here this conversation come to tirants attention and he bring hi galley alongside the king ship when he come aboard the king be in hi chamber sleep when ricart hear that tirant have come he go up to him and say tirant if you dare to say that im not a good knight than you be i offer to do battle with you to the death and he throw hi glove at him a a challenge when tirant saw that he want to fight him with so little provocation he raise hi hand and deal him a hard blow the noise they raise be so loud that the king have to come up with hi sword in hand when tirant saw the king he go up to the forecastle and from there he defend himself and he say to the king sire your majesty should punish this shameless knight who be the instigator of all evil he have never find himself in a joust much less see the flash of an angry sword before hi eye and now he want to fight me to the death over nothing if he defeat me he will have defeat all the chivalresque act i have accomplish to my glory and honor and if i be the victor i will have conquer a man who have never bear arm after he have say these word he swing safely down to hi galley on a rope if the king have be able to put hi hand on him at that moment because he commit such an outrageous act on hi ship it would not have be surprising if hed have hi head remove from hi shoulder the king depart with the entire armada from tripoli in libya and go toward cyprus sack the turkish coast and set it red with blood and flame and they load all the ship with the many rich they have take when they reach cyprus they go to the city of famagusta take provision of food and turn toward tunis there the king disembark and they press the city hard in combat tirant and hi men attack a tower which have a deep moat at it foot and tirant fell into it ricart be heavily arm to see if he could take revenge on tirant when he reach the tower he saw tirant lie in the moat ricart leap into the moat wear all hi armor and help tirant get up then he say tirant here stand your mortal enemy who can give you death or life god forbid that i should let you die at the hand of the moor when i can give you aid and he pull him out for they would surely have kill him if they have find him there when he be out ricart say to him now you be free tirant protect yourself from death as well a you can because you can be sure that i will do everything in my power to kill you virtuous knight say tirant i have see your great goodness and courtesy and i know that you save me from a cruel death i kneel to the ground and beg your forgiveness for the wayi offend you i give you my sword so that you can take whatever

at what tirant have say and tirant continue my lord if it please your majesty when we be in the palace allow me to go and pay my respect to the empress and to your beloved daughter the infanta the emperor give hi consent when they be in the palace the emperor take him by the hand and lead him to the empresss chamber they find her in the following condition the chamber be very dark for there be no light at all and the emperor say my lady here be our captain who have come to pay you hi respect she reply in a very weak voice very well he be welcome tirantsaid my lady it be by faith that i must believe that the one speaking to me be the empress captain say the emperor whoever hold the captaincy of the greek empire have the power to open window and to look everyone in the face to remove the mourning they bear for a husband father son or brother tirant ask for a light torch to be bring and it be do immediately when the light be cast on the room the captain discover a pavilion entirely in

all with the empress and the infanta carmesina tirant approach the bed make a deep bow to the infanta and kiss her hand then he open the window and it seem a though all the woman be come out of a long period of captivity they have be plunge into darkness a long while because of the death of the emperor son tirant say my lord speaking by your leave i will tell your highness and the empress my idea i see that the people in this notable city be very sad and troubled for two reason the first be because of the loss of the prince your son your majesty should not be trouble for he die in the service of god uphold the holy catholic faith instead you should praise and give thanks to the immense goodness of god our lord because he give him to you and it be hi wish to take him from you for hi own good and he have place him in the glory of paradise the second reason they be sad be because all the moor be so nearby that they be afraid of lose their possession and their life and a a less evil that they will become captive of the infidel that be why your highness and the empress must show smile face to everyone who see you to console them in their grief so that they will gather courage to fight against the enemy the captain advice be good say the emperor it be my wish and my command that men as well a woman shed their mourning immediately while the emperor be talk tirants ear be attentive to what he be say but hi eye be contemplate the great beauty of carmesina a the window have be close it be very warm so her blouse be partly open expose her breast like two apple from the garden of eden

these hour if you dont care for them he say they should be give to one of the infantas maiden as soon a the emperor saw them he be astonish at their uniqueness this say the emperor can only belong to a maiden of the royal family he give them to hi daughter carmesina she be very happy because the hour be so beautiful and also because they be tirants and she stand up and say sire would your majesty approve if we send for the captain and the minstrel and have a small party the mourning and this sadness have last such a long time my dearest daughter dont you know that i have no other consolation in this world except you and isabel the queen of hungary who for my sin be absent from my sight and since my son die i have no other worldly good but you all the happiness you can have will bring me peace in my old age the infanta quickly send a page for tirant and have diafebus sit next to her when tirant receive hi lady command he leave hi quarter and go to the emperor who ask him to dance with

our own ship have reach the island of euboea and i believe they will soon be here tirant take off hi cap and say command me to go against the genoese whenever you wish your majesty i be ready ill tell you what you must do for now say the emperor go to where my judgment seat be i want you to sit on it listen to the case bring before you and judge them with mercy one of the member of the council name montsalvat stand up and say sire your majesty should take a close look at these matter for there be three obstacle first the duke of macedonia should not be deprive of hi right he have the captaincy and it be hi privilege since he be closer to the throne second it should not be give to a foreigner who have no official position in the empire third before the soldier leave here they should make a pilgrimage bearing gift to the island where paris steal helen for that be how the greek be victorious over the trojan in ancient time the emperor could not tolerate the knight foolish word and he say very angrily if it be not for the respect i have for our heavenly father i would have you behead it would fit all your merit and it would be a sacrifice to god and an example to this world because you be a wicked christian it be my command that tirant who be our captain now be above all our captain he deserve it because of hi virtue and shin chivalry the duke of macedonia who be cowardly and inept at war never know how to win a battle the person i designate will be captain and anyone who contradict him will receive my punishment in such a waythat they will be remember throughout the world the emperor stand up and would not hear another word from anyone he have a proclamation read throughout the city that anyone have a complaint against anyone els should go to the hall of justice the following day and from that day forward and justice would be mete out the following day the captain sit on the imperial judgment seat and hear everyone with a complaint and make judgment on them all for from the time the grand turk and the moorish sultan have come into the empire no justice at all have be give two week after tirant come all the emperor ship arrive carry men wheat and horse before the arrival of the ship the emperor present the captain with eightythree large and beautiful horse and many suit of armor tirant have diafebus come up first so he could choose from the weapon and horse then ricart make hi choice and finally all the other while tirant take nothing for himself tirant be deeply in love with the princess and hi suffering increase daily hi love be so great that when he be with her he do not dare talk to her about anything concern love and the day for hi departure be draw near for they be wait only for the horse to recover from the hardship they have endure at sea the discreet princess know about tirants love she send a page to ask tirant to be at the palace at noon because that be the time when all the other would be rest when tirant receive hi lady command he be the happy man in the world he immediately send for diafebus to give him the news and to tell him that she want only the two of them to go diafebus say captain i be very pleased at this begin even though i dont know what the end will bring at the appoint hour the two knight go up to the palace and quietly enter the princesss chamber hop to have victory when she saw them she be very happy she stand up and take tirants hand and make him sit next to her then diafebus take stephanie by one arm and widow repose by the other and lead them aside so they would not hear what the princess be say to tirant the princess smile and softly say since you be a foreigner i would not want you to come to any harm unknowingly i know you come to this land at the bidding of the king of sicily because he have confidence in your merit but he could not tell you of the danger that might befall you because he do not know about it tirantanswered so that you will not think me ungrateful for what you be tell me i kiss your hand and foot and i promise to do everything your highness command me tirant beg her to give him her hand so he could kiss it but she would not then he insist several time and when he saw that she still would not he call widow repose and stephanie to satisfy the captain they beg her to allow him to kiss her hand she do it this waynot want to let him kiss the back of her hand she open it so he would kiss the palm because kiss the palm be a sign of love and kiss the back of the hand be a sign of dominance then the princess say to him blessed knight may merciful god keep you from the hand of that ravenous lion the duke of macedonia he be a cruel and envious man and very knowledgeable about treachery he be infamous for the fact that he have only kill people wickedly it be well know that he kill that valiant knight my brother when my brother be fight courageously against the enemy he come up behind him and cut the strap of hi helmet so that hi head would be uncovered and he be kill by the moor a great traitor like him should be fear and so virtuous knight i advise you when you be in battle be wary of him dont trust him even while you be eat or sleep it happen one day at dinner time that tirant find the empress and the princess still at the table he come into the hall and serve the empress and her daughter a steward and cupbearer since this be hi privilege a captain when tirant saw that the meal be nearly over he ask the empress to clear up a matter he be uncertain about the empress answer that if she could she would do it very gladly tell me my lady say tirant for a knight which be most honorable to die well or to die badly since he must die and he say not a word more the princess say holy mother of god what a question to ask my mother everyone know it better to die well than to die badly then tirant strike the table with hi clenched fist and mutter so be it so softly that they could barely hear him without another word he get up and go to hi lodging and everyone be leave astonish at tirants behavior the following day the princess be feel very upset by what tirant have say in the morning while the emperor be at mass with all the lady tirant go into the church for prayer and he tell the emperor sire the galley be ready to go to cyprus to bring back provision do your majesty want them to leave the emperor say i wish they be one hundred mile out to sea right now tirant quickly go to the port to give the order for them to set sail when the princess saw tirant leave she call diafebus and ask him to give tirant the message that after he have eat he should come to see her immediately because she want very much to talk to him and that later they would dance when tirant hear the news he consider at once what it might mean he have the most beautiful mirror buy that could be find and put it inside hi sleeve when he think it be about time they go to the palace and find the emperor talk to hi daughter the emperor saw them come and send for hi minstrel and they dance for a good while after watch them for a time the emperor withdraw to hi chamber the princess immediately stop dance and take tirant by the hand they sit at

she would find a portrait of some woman in the mirror but she saw only her own face then she be astonish that a lady could be court in this waywithout word while she be happily reflect on what tirant have do widow repose and stephanie come in they find the princess sit with the mirror in her hand and they say to her my lady where do you get such a pretty mirror the princess tell them about the waytirant have declare hi love for her and she say she have never hear of it be do before not even in all the story book ive read have i ever find such a graceful declaration how knowledgeable these

that famous king of sicily along with other foreigner wear gold and silk clothes theyve borrow do you want to lose your good reputation for a man like him the princess be very upset by what the widow have say and she go into her chamber nearly cry stephanie go with her tell her not to be so upset and console her a best she could isnt it terrible say the princess here i be scold by the very mistress who nurse me what if she have see me do something really bad i believe she would have send out a crier to advertise it in the court and to the entire city i trust god that her wicked dishonest curse tongue will have the punishment it deserve it normal say stephanie for maiden in the court to be love and court and for them to have three kind of love virtuous profitable and vicious the first one which be virtuous be when some grandee love a maiden and she feel very honor when other know that he dance joust or go into battle for her love the second be profitable and it be when some gentleman or knight of ancient and virtuous lineage love a maiden and sway her to him with gift the third be vicious when the maiden love the gentleman or knight for her own pleasure and he be generous in word that give her life for a year but if they go too far they can end in a heavily curtain bed among perfumed sheet where she can spend an entire winter night this last kind of love seem much good to me than the other when the princess heard stephanie say such witty thing she begin to smile and most of her melancholy leave her while they be talk the empress ask where her daughter be since she have not see her for a long time she go out into the hall and meet the empress who ask her why her eye be red my lady say the princess all day long today ive have a headache she make her sit

the slight advance that the soldier or their horse make they quickly fell into the water and be not able to get up and they be all sweep down river if the duke have only go one mile upstream all hi men would have be able to get across without get wet the enemy draw back a little so that the men would come across and they pretend to retreat to a small hill there and the duke use all hi force to

lord the grand turk and the sultan after the great number of death you bring to our soldier you imprison a small child the brother in law of our sovereign lord the great sultan hi wife brother along with many other virtuous knight we beg of you on behalf of the thing you love most in this world to give u the child if you will not do this for love ask a ransom for him in silver or gold and it will

egregious and noble lord this be more my business that it be the rest of yours because i be closer to the imperial crown it my advice and my demand that we grant them the sixmonth truce theyre ask for and even long if they wish and even peace if they want it whether the emperor like it or not the duke of pera couldnt stand to hear anything more from the duke of macedoniafor they be at odds with each other because each of them want to take the princess a hi wifeand he say gentleman it seem to me that for hi majesty the emperor benefit and for the well be of the entire empire and the republic we shouldnt offer them peace or a truce many felt they should accept a truce but most agree with the duke of pera then tirant say since hi high majesty the emperor have give me the right to speak in hi place i tell your lordship that i dont think it would help anyone to have a truce with these evil people all their blood thats be spill be because of your might and thats the reason theyre ask for peace or for a six month truce because during that time gentleman you know that theyll be wait for the genoese ship to bring foot soldier and cavalry and in that time they would fill this land with such great number of men that afterward all the power of christianity wouldnt be enough to throw them out the duke of macedonia speak up and say tirant if you dont want to have a truce i do and ill make one and i advise everyone to make it with me duke say tirant dont make disorder out of what the emperor have order if you try to do that ill have you seize and take to hi majesty the emperor then

with such ceremony then they all go to the council tent and tirant give them the follow reply you tell the moorish sultan and the grand turk that i will in no way
