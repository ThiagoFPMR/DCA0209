in suppose him ready to acknowledge hi sisterinlaw and her amiable daughter the preparation for the elopement would not permit hi visit them the next day but in the meanwhile he desire lorenzo to assure them of hi friendship and to supply elvira upon hi account with any sum which she might want this the youth promise to do as soon a her abode should be know to him he then take leave of hi future brother and return to the palace de medina the day be already on the point of break when the marquis retire to hi chamber conscious that hi narrative would take up some hour and wish to secure himself from interruption on return to the hotel he order hi attendant not to sit up for him consequently he be somewhat surprised on enter hi antiroom to find theodore establish there the page sit near a table with a pen in hi hand and be so totally occupy by hi employment that he perceive not hi lord approach the marquis stop to observe him theodore write a few line then pause and scratch out a part of the writing then write again smile and seem highly pleased with what he have be about at last he throw down hi pen sprang from hi chair and clap hi hand together joyfully there it be cry he aloud now they be charm hi transport be interrupt by a laugh from the marquis who suspect the nature of hi employment what be so charming theodore the youth start and look round he blush ran to the table seize the paper on which he have be write and conceal it in confusion oh my lord i know not that you be so near me can i be of use to you lucas be already go to bed i shall follow hi example when i have give my opinion of your verse my verse my lord nay i be sure that you have be write some for nothing els could have keep you awake till this time of the morning where be they theodore i shall like to see your composition theodores cheek glow with still deep crimson he long to show hi poetry but first chose to be press for it indeed my lord they be not worthy your attention not these verse which you just now declare to be so charming come come let me see whether our opinion be the same i promise that you shall find in me an indulgent critic the boy produce hi paper with seem reluctance but the satisfaction which sparkle in hi dark expressive eye betray the vanity of hi little bosom the marquis smile while he observe the emotion of an heart a yet but little skilled in veil it sentiment he seat himself upon a sopha theodore while hope and fear contend on hi anxious countenance wait with inquietude for hi master decision while the marquis read the following line the marquis return the paper with a smile of encouragement your little poem please me much say he however you must not count my opinion for anything i be no judge of verse and for my own part never compose more than six line in my life those six produce so unlucky an effect that i be fully resolve never to compose another but i wander from my subject i be go to say that you can not employ your time bad than in make verse an author whether good or bad or between both be an animal whom everybody be privilege to attack for though all be not able to write book all conceive themselves able to judge them a bad composition carry with it it own punishment contempt and ridicule a good one excite envy and entail upon it author a thousand mortification he find himself assail by partial and illhumoured criticism one man find fault with the plan another with the style a third with the precept which it strive to inculcate and they who can not succeed in find fault with the book employ themselves in stigmatize it author they maliciously rake out from obscurity every little circumstance which may throw ridicule upon hi private character or conduct and aim at wound the man since they can not hurt the writer in short to enter the list of literature be wilfully to expose yourself to the arrow of neglect ridicule envy and disappointment whether you write well or ill be assure that you will not escape from blame indeed this circumstance contain a young author chief consolation he remember that lope de vega and calderona have unjust and envious critic and he modestly conceive himself to be exactly in their predicament but i be conscious that all these sage observation be throw away upon you authorship be a mania to conquer which no reason be sufficiently strong and you might a easily persuade me not to love a i persuade you not to write however if you can not help be occasionally seize with a poetical paroxysm take at least the precaution of communicate your verse to none but those whose partiality for you secure their approbation then my lord you do not think these line tolerable say theodore with an humble and deject air you mistake my meaning a i say before they have please me much but my regard for you make me partial and other might judge them less favourably i must still remark that even my prejudice in your favour do not blind me so much a to prevent my observe several fault for instance you make a terrible confusion of metaphor you be too apt to make the strength of your line consist more in the word than sense some of the verse only seem introduce in order to rhyme with other and most of the best idea be borrow from other poet though possibly you be unconscious of the theft yourself these fault may occasionally be excuse in a work of length but a short poem must be correct and perfect all this be true segnor but you should consider that i only write for pleasure your defect be the less excusable their incorrectness may be forgive in those who work for money who be oblige to compleat a give task in a give time and be pay accord to the bulk not value of their production but in those whom no necessity force to turn author who merely write for fame and have full leisure to polish their composition fault be impardonable and merit the sharp arrow of criticism the marquis rise from the sopha the page look discourage and melancholy and this do not escape hi master observation however add he smile i think that these line do you no discredit your versification be tolerably easy and your ear seem to be just the perusal of your little poem upon the whole give me much pleasure and if it be not ask too great a favour i shall be highly oblige to you for a copy the youth countenance immediately clear up he perceive not the smile half approve half ironical which accompany the request and he promise the copy with great readiness the marquis withdraw to hi chamber much amuse by the instantaneous effect produce upon theodores vanity by the conclusion of hi criticism he throw himself upon hi couch sleep soon steal over him and hi dream present him with the most flattering picture of happiness with agnes on reach

despair of her life but that they have declare the only chance for her recovery to consist in keep her quiet and not to permit those to approach her whose presence be likely to agitate her not a word of all this be believe by lorenzo any more than he credit the expression of grief and affection for agnes with which this account be interlard to end the business he put the pope bull into the hand of the domina and insist that ill or in health hi sister should be deliver to him without delay the prioress receive the paper with an air of humility but no sooner have her eye glance over the content than her resentment baffle all the effort of hypocrisy a deep crimson spread itself over her face and she dart upon lorenzo look of rage and menace this order be positive say she in a voice of anger which she in vain strove to disguise willingly would i obey it but unfortunately it be out of my power lorenzo interrupt her by an exclamation of surprize i repeat it segnor to obey this order be
