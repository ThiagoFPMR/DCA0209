to m talleyrand perigord late bishop of autun sir having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately publish on national education i dedicate this volume to you the first dedication that i have ever write to induce you to read it with attention and because i think that you will understand me which i do not suppose many pert witlings will who may ridicule the argument theybe unable to answer but sir i carry my respect for your understanding still far so far that i be confident you will not throw my work aside and hastily conclude that i be in the wrong because you do not view the subject in the same light yourself and pardon my frankness but i must observe that you treat it in too cursory a manner content to consider it a it have be consider formerly when the right of man not to advert to woman be trample on a chimerical i call upon you therefore now to weigh what i have advance respect the right of woman and national education and i call with the firm tone of humanity for my argument sir be dictate by a disinterested spirit i plead for my sex not for myself independence i have long consider a the grand blessing of life the basis of every virtue and independence i will ever secure by contract my want though i be to live on a barren heath it be then an affection for the whole human race that make my pen dart rapidly along to support what i believe to be the cause of virtue and the same motive lead me earnestly to wish to see woman place in a station in which she would advance instead of retard the progress of those glorious principle that give a substance to morality my opinion indeed respect the right and duty of woman seem to flow so naturally from these simple principle that i think it scarcely possible but that some of the enlarged mind who form your admirable constitution will coincide with me in france there be undoubtedly a more general diffusion of knowledge than in any part of the european world and i attribute it in a great measure to the social intercourse which have long subsist between the sex it be true i utter my sentiment with freedom that in france the very essence of sensuality have be extract to regale the voluptuary and a kind of sentimental lust have prevail which together with the system of duplicity that the whole tenor of their political and civil government taught have give a sinister sort of sagacity to the french character properly term finesse and a polish of manner that injure the substance by hunt sincerity out of society and modesty the fair garb of virtue have be more grossly insult in france than even in england till their woman have treat a prudish that attention to decency which brutes instinctively observe manner and moral be so nearly ally that theyhave often be confound but though the former should only be the natural reflection of the latter yet when various cause have produce factitious and corrupt manner which be very early catch morality become an empty name the personal reserve and sacred respect for cleanliness and delicacy in domestic life which french woman almost despise be the graceful pillar of modesty but far from despise them if the pure flame of patriotism have reach their bosom theyshould labour to improve the moral of their fellowcitizens by teach men not only to respect modesty in woman but to acquire it themselves a the only way to merit their esteem contend for the right of woman my main argument be build on this simple principle that if she be not prepare by education to become the companion of man she will stop the progress of knowledge for truth must be common to all or it will be inefficacious with respect to it influence on general practice and how can woman be expect to cooperate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty and see in what manner it be connect with her real good if child be to be educate to understand the true principle of patriotism their mother must be a patriot and the love of mankind from which an orderly train of virtue spring can only be produce by consider the moral and civil interest of mankind but the education and situation of woman at present shuts her out from such investigation in this work i have produce many argument which to me be conclusive to prove that the prevailing notion respect a sexual character be subversive of morality and i have contend that to render the human body and mind more perfect chastity must more universally prevail and that chastity will never be respect in the male world till the person of a woman be not a it be idolize when little virtue or sense embellish it with the grand trace of mental beauty or the interesting simplicity of affection consider sir dispassionately these observation for a glimpse of this truth seem to open before you when you observe that to see one half of the human race exclude by the other from all participation of government be a political phenomenon that accord to abstract principle it be impossible to explain if so on what do your constitution rest if the abstract right of man will bear discussion and explanation those of woman by a parity of reason will not shrink from the same test though a different opinion prevail in this country build on the very argument which you use to justify the oppression of woman prescription consider i address you a a legislator whether when men contend for their freedom and to be allow to judge for themselves respect their own happiness it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate woman even though you firmly believe that you be act in the manner best calculate to promote their happiness who make man the exclusive judge if woman partake with him the gift of reason in this style argue tyrant of every denomination from the weak king to the weak father of a family theybe all eager to crush reason yet always assert that theyusurp it throne only to be useful do you not act a similar part when you force all woman by deny them civil and political right to remain immured in their family grope in the dark for surely sir you will not assert that a duty can be bind which be not found on reason if indeed this be their destination argument may be draw from reason and thus augustly support the more understanding woman acquire the more theywill be attach to their duty comprehend it for unless theycomprehend it unless their moral be fix on the same immutable principle a those of man no authority can make them discharge it in a virtuous manner theymay be convenient slave but slavery will have it constant effect degrade the master and the abject dependent but if woman be to be exclude without have a voice from a participation of the natural right of mankind prove first to ward off the charge of injustice and inconsistency that theywant reason els this flaw in your new constitution the first constitution found on reason will ever show that man must in some shape act like a tyrant and tyranny in whatever part of society it rear it brazen front will ever undermine morality i have repeatedly assert and produce what appear to me irrefragable argument draw from matter of fact to prove my assertion that woman can not by force be confine to domestic concern for theywill however ignorant intermeddle with more weighty affair neglect private duty only to disturb by cunning trick the orderly plan of reason which rise above their comprehension besides whilst theybe only make to acquire personal accomplishment men will seek for pleasure in variety and faithless husband will make faithless wife such ignorant being indeed will be very excusable when not teach to respect public good nor allow any civil right theyattempt to do themselves justice by retaliation the box of mischief thus open in society what be to preserve private virtue the only security of public freedom and universal happiness let there be then no coercion established in society and the common law of gravity prevail the sex will fall into their proper place and now that more equitable law be form your citizen marriage may become more sacred your young men may choose wife from motif of affection and your maiden allow love to root out vanity the father of a family will not then weaken hi constitution and debase hi sentiment by visit the harlot nor forget in obey the call of appetite the purpose for which it be implant and the mother will not neglect her child to practise the art of coquetry when sense and modesty secure her the friendship of her husband but till men become attentive to the duty of a father it be vain to expect woman to spend that time in their nursery which theywise in their generation choose to spend at their glass for this exertion of cunning be only an instinct of nature to enable them to obtain indirectly a little of that power of which theybe unjustly deny a share for if woman be not permit to enjoy legitimate right theywill render both men and themselves vicious to obtain illicit privilege i wish sir to set some investigation of this kind afloat in france and should theylead to a confirmation of my principle when your constitution be revise the right of woman may be respect if it be fully prove that reason call for this respect and loudly demand justice for one half of the human race i be sir yoursrespectfully mw introduction after consider the historic page and view the living world with anxious solicitude the most melancholy emotion of sorrowful indignation have depress my spirit and i have sigh when oblige to confess that either nature have make a great difference between man and man or that the civilization which have hitherto take place in the world have be very partial i have turn over various book write on the subject of education and patiently observe the conduct of parent and the management of school but what have be the result a profound conviction that the neglected education of my fellow creature be the grand source of the misery i deplore and that woman in particular be render weak and wretched by a variety of concur cause originate from one hasty conclusion the conduct and manner of woman in fact evidently prove that their mind be not in a healthy state for like the flower that be plant in too rich a soil strength and usefulness be sacrifice to beauty and the flaunting leave after have please a fastidious eye fade disregard on the stalk long before the season when theyought to have arrive at maturity one cause of this barren bloom i attribute to a false system of education gather from the book write on this subject by men who consider female rather a woman than human creature have be more anxious to make them allure mistress than rational wife and the understanding of the sex have be so bubble by this specious homage that the civilized woman of the present century with a few exception be only anxious to inspire love when theyought to cherish a noble ambition and by their ability and virtue exact respect in a treatise therefore on female right and manner the work which have be particularly write for their improvement must not be overlook especially when it be assert in direct term that the mind of woman be enfeeble by false refinement that the book of instruction write by men of genius have have the same tendency a more frivolous production and that in the true style of mahometanism theybe only consider a female and not a a part of the human specie when improvable reason be allow to be the dignified distinction which raise men above the brute creation and put a natural sceptre in a feeble hand yet because i be a woman i would not lead my reader to suppose that i mean violently to agitate the contested question respect the equality and inferiority of the sex but a the subject lie in my way and i can not pass it over without subject the main tendency of my reason to misconstruction i shall stop a moment to deliver in a few word my opinion in the government of the physical world it be observable that the female in general be inferior to the male the male pursue the female yieldsthis be the law of nature and it do not appear to be suspend or abrogate in favour of woman this physical superiority can not be deniedand it be a noble prerogative but not content with this natural preeminence men endeavour to sink u still lower merely to render u allure object for a moment and woman intoxicate by the adoration which men under the influence of their sens pay them do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their heart or to become the friend of the fellow creature who find amusement in their society i be aware of an obvious inference from every quarter have i hear exclamation against masculine woman but where be theyto be find if by this appellation men mean to inveigh against their ardour in hunt shooting and gaming i shall most cordially join in the cry but if it be against the imitation of manly virtue or more properly speak the attainment of those talent and virtues the exercise of which ennoble the human character and which raise female in the scale of animal be when theybe comprehensively termed mankindall those who view them with a philosophical eye must i should think wish with me that theymay every day grow more and more masculine this discussion naturally divide the subject i shall first consider woman in the grand light of human creature who in common with men be place on this earth to unfold their faculty and afterwards i shall more particularly point out their peculiar designation i wish also to steer clear of an error which many respectable writer have fall into for the instruction which have hitherto be address to woman have rather be applicable to ladies if the little indirect advice that be scatter through sandford and merton be except but address my sex in a firm tone i pay particular attention to those in the middle class because theyappear to be in the most natural state perhaps the seed of false refinement immorality and vanity have ever be shed by the great weak artificial being raise above the common want and affection of their race in a premature unnatural manner undermine the very foundation of virtue and spread corruption through the whole mass of society a a class of mankind theyhave the strong claim to pity the education of the rich tend to render them vain and helpless and the unfolding mind be not strengthen by the practice of those duty which dignify the human character theyonly live to amuse themselves and by the same law which in nature invariably produce certain effect theysoon only afford barren amusement but a i purpose take a separate view of the different rank of society and of the moral character of woman in each this hint be for the present sufficient and i have only allude to the subject because it appear to me to be the very essence of an introduction to give a cursory account of the content of the work it introduce my own sex i hope will excuse me if i treat them like rational creature instead of flatter their fascinating grace and view them a if theybe in a state of perpetual childhood unable to stand alone i earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consistsi wish to persuade woman to endeavour to acquire strength both of mind and body and to convince them that the soft phrase susceptibility of heart delicacy of sentiment and refinement of taste be almost synonymous with epithet of weakness and that those being who be only the object of pity and that kind of love which have be term it sister will soon become object of contempt dismissing then those pretty feminine phrase which the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence and despising that weak elegancy of mind exquisite sensibility and sweet docility of manner suppose to be the sexual characteristic of the weak vessel i wish to show that elegance be inferior to virtue that the first object of laudable ambition be to obtain a character a a human be regardless of the distinction of sex and that secondary view should be bring to this simple touchstone this be a rough sketch of my plan and should i express my conviction with the energetic emotion that i feel whenever i think of the subject the dictate of experience and reflection will be felt by some of my reader animate by this important object i shall disdain to cull my phrase or polish my stylei aim at be useful and sincerity will render me unaffected for wish rather to persuade by the force of my argument than dazzle by the elegance of my language i shall not waste my time in round period nor in fabricate the turgid bombast of artificial feeling which come from the head never reach the heart i shall be employ about thing not word and anxious to render my sex more respectable member of society i shall try to avoid that flowery diction which have slide from essay into novel and from novel into familiar letter and conversation these pretty nothing these caricature of the real beauty of sensibility drop glibly from the tongue vitiate the taste and create a kind of sickly delicacy that turn away from simple unadorned truth and a deluge of false sentiment and overstretched feeling stifle the natural emotion of the heart render the domestic pleasure insipid that ought to sweeten the exercise of those severe duty which educate a rational and immortal be for a noble field of action the education of woman have of late be more attended to than formerly yet theybe still reckon a frivolous sex and ridicule or pity by the writer who endeavour by satire or instruction to improve them it be acknowledge that theyspend many of the first year of their life in acquire a smattering of accomplishment meanwhile strength of body and mind be sacrifice to libertine notion of beauty to the desire of establish themselves the only way woman can rise in the worldby marriage and this desire making mere animal of them when theymarry theyact a such child may be expect to act theydress theypaint and nickname god creature surely these weak being be only fit for the seraglio can theygovern a family or take care of the poor babe whom theybring into the world if then it can be fairly deduce from the present conduct of the sex from the prevalent fondness for pleasure which take place of ambition and those noble passion that open and enlarge the soul that the instruction which woman have receive have only tend with the constitution of civil society to render them insignificant object of desire mere propagator of fool if it can be prove that in aim to accomplish them without cultivate their understanding theybe take out of their sphere of duty and make ridiculous and useless when the short live bloom of beauty be over i presume that rational men will excuse me for endeavour to persuade them to become more masculine and respectable indeed the word masculine be only a bugbear there be little reason to fear that woman will acquire too much courage or fortitude for their apparent inferiority with respect to bodily strength must render them in some degree dependent on men in the various relation of life but why should it be increase by prejudice that give a sex to virtue and confound simple truth with sensual revery woman be in fact so much degrade by mistaken notion of female excellence that i do not mean to add a paradox when i assert that this artificial weakness produce a propensity to tyrannize and give birth to cunning the natural opponent of strength which lead them to play off those contemptible infantile air that undermine esteem even whilst theyexcite desire do not foster these prejudice and theywill naturally fall into their subordinate yet respectable station in life it seem scarcely necessary to say that i now speak of the sex in general many individual have more sense than their male relative and a nothing preponderate where there be a constant struggle for an equilibrium without it have naturally more gravity some woman govern their husband without degrade themselves because intellect will always govern vindication of the right of woman chapter the right and involved duty of mankind considered in the present state of society it appear necessary to go back to first principle in search of the most simple truth and to dispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground to clear my way i must be allow to ask some plain question and the answer will probably appear as unequivocal a the axiom on which reasoning be build though when entangle with various motif of action theybe formally contradict either by the word or conduct of men in what do man preeminence over the brute creation consist the answer be as clear a that a half be less than the whole in reason what acquirement exalts one be above another virtue we spontaneously reply for what purpose be the passion implant that man by struggle with them might attain a degree of knowledge deny to the brute whisper experience consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of happiness must be estimate by the degree of reason virtue and knowledge that distinguish the individual and direct the law which bind society and that from the exercise of reason knowledge and virtue naturally flow be equally undeniable if mankind be view collectively the right and duty of man thus simplify it seem almost impertinent to attempt to illustrate truth that appear so incontrovertible yet such deeply root prejudice have cloud reason and such spurious quality have assume the name of virtue that it be necessary to pursue the course of reason a it have be perplex and involve in error by various adventitious circumstance compare the simple axiom with casual deviation men in general seem to employ their reason to justify prejudice which theyhave imbibe theycan not trace how rather than to root them out the mind must be strong that resolutely form it own principle for a kind of intellectual cowardice prevails which make many men shrink from the task or only do it by half yet the imperfect conclusion thus draw be frequently very plausible because theybe build on partial experience on just though narrow view go back to first principle vice skulks with all it native deformity from close investigation but a set of shallow reasoner be always exclaim that these argument prove too much and that a measure rotten at the core may be expedient thus expediency be continually contrast with simple principle till truth be lose in a mist of word virtue in form and knowledge render a sound nothing by the specious prejudice that assume it name that the society be form in the wise manner whose constitution be found on the nature of man strike in the abstract every thinking be so forcibly that it look like presumption to endeavour to bring forward proofs though proof must be bring or the strong hold of prescription will never be force by reason yet to urge prescription a an argument to justify the deprive men or woman of their natural right be one of the absurd sophisms which daily insult common sense the civilization of the bulk of the people of europe be very partial nay it may be make a question whether theyhave acquire any virtue in exchange for innocence equivalent to the misery produce by the vice that have be plaster over unsightly ignorance and the freedom which have be barter for splendid slavery the desire of dazzling by rich the most certain preeminence that man can obtain the pleasure of command flatter sycophant and many other complicate low calculation of dot selflove have all contribute to overwhelm the mass of mankind and make liberty a convenient handle for mock patriotism for whilst rank and title be hold of the utmost importance before which genius must hide it diminished head it be with a few exception very unfortunate for a nation when a man of ability without rank or property push himself forward to notice ala what unheard of misery have thousand suffer to purchase a cardinal hat for an intriguing obscure adventurer who long to be rank with prince or lord it over them by seize the triple crown such indeed have be the wretchedness that have flow from hereditary honour rich and monarchy that men of lively sensibility have almost utter blasphemy in order to justify the dispensation of providence man have be hold out a independent of hi power who make him or a a lawless planet dart from it orbit to steal the celestial fire of reason and the vengeance of heaven lurking in the subtile flame sufficiently punish hi temerity by introduce evil into the world impress by this view of the misery and disorder which pervade society and fatigue with jostle against artificial fool rousseau become enamoured of solitude and be at the same time an optimist he labour with uncommon eloquence to prove that man be naturally a solitary animal mislead by hi respect for the goodness of god who certainly for what man of sense and feeling can doubt it give life only to communicate happiness he consider evil a positive and the work of man not aware that he be exalt one attribute at the expense of another equally necessary to divine perfection reared on a false hypothesis hi argument in favour of a state of nature be plausible but unsound i say unsound for to assert that a state of nature be preferable to civilization in all it possible perfection be in other word to arraign supreme wisdom and the paradoxical exclamation that god have make all thing right and that evil have be introduce by the creature whom he form know what he form be as unphilosophical a impious when that wise being who create u and place u here saw the fair idea he will by allow it to be so that the passion should unfold our reason because he could see that present evil would produce future good could the helpless creature whom he call from nothing break loose from hi providence and boldly learn to know good by practise evil without hi permission no how could that energetic advocate for immortality argue so inconsistently had mankind remain for ever in the brutal state of nature which even hi magic pen can not paint a a state in which a single virtue take root it would have be clear though not to the sensitive unreflecting wanderer that man be bear to run the circle of life and death and adorn god garden for some purpose which could not easily be reconcile with hi attribute but if to crown the whole there be to be rational creature produce allow to rise in excellency by the exercise of power implant for that purpose if benignity itself think fit to call into existence a creature above the brute who could think and improve himself why should that inestimable gift for a gift it be if a man be so create a to have a capacity to rise above the state in which sensation produce brutal ease be call in direct term a curse a curse it might be reckon if all our existence be bound by our continuance in this world for why should the gracious fountain of life give u passion and the power of reflect only to embitter our day and inspire u with mistaken notion of dignity why should he lead u from love of ourselves to the sublime emotion which the discovery of hi wisdom and goodness excites if these feeling be not set in motion to improve our nature of which theymake a part and render u capable of enjoy a more godlike portion of happiness firmly persuade that no evil exist in the world that god do not design to take place i build my belief on the perfection of god rousseau exert himself to prove that all wa right originally a crowd of author that all is now right and i that all will be right but true to hi first position next to a state of nature rousseau celebrate barbarism and apostrophize the shade of fabricius he forget that in conquer the world the roman never dream of establish their own liberty on a firm basis or of extend the reign of virtue eager to support hi system he stigmatize as vicious every effort of genius and utter the apotheosis of savage virtue he exalt those to demigod who be scarcely humanthe brutal spartan who in defiance of justice and gratitude sacrifice in cold blood the slave that have show themselves men to rescue their oppressor disgust with artificial manner and virtues the citizen of geneva instead of properly sift the subject throw away the wheat with the chaff without wait to inquire whether the evil which hi ardent soul turn from indignantly be the consequence of civilization or the vestige of barbarism he saw vice trample on virtue and the semblance of goodness take place of the reality he saw talent bent by power to sinister purpose and never think of trace the gigantic mischief up to arbitrary power up to the hereditary distinction that clash with the mental superiority that naturally raise a man above hi fellow he do not perceive that the regal power in a few generation introduces idiot into the noble stem and hold out bait to render thousand idle and vicious nothing can set the regal character in a more contemptible point of view than the various crime that have elevate men to the supreme dignity vile intrigue unnatural crime and every vice that degrade our nature have be the step to this distinguish eminence yet million of men have supinely allow the nerveless limb of the posterity of such rapacious prowler to rest quietly on their ensanguined throne what but a pestilential vapour can hover over society when it chief director be only instruct in the invention of crime or the stupid routine of childish ceremony will men never be wise will theynever cease to expect corn from tare and fig from thistle it be impossible for any man when the most favourable circumstance concur to acquire sufficient knowledge and strength of mind to discharge the duty of a king entrust with uncontrolled power how then must theybe violate when hi very elevation be an insuperable bar to the attainment of either wisdom or virtue when all the feeling of a man be stifle by flattery and reflection shut out by pleasure surely it be madness to make the fate of thousand depend on the caprice of a weak fellow creature whose very station sink him necessarily below the mean of hi subject but one power should not be throw down to exalt anotherfor all power intoxicate weak man and it abuse prove that the more equality there be establish among men the more virtue and happiness will reign in society but this and any similar maxim deduce from simple reason raise an outcrythe church or the state be in danger if faith in the wisdom of antiquity be not implicit and theywho rouse by the sight of human calamity dare to attack human authority be revile a despisers of god and enemy of man these be bitter calumny yet theyreach one of the best of men dr price whose ash still preach peace and whose memory demand a respectful pause when subject be discuss that lay so near hi heart after attack the sacred majesty of king i shall scarcely excite surprise by add my firm persuasion that every profession in which great subordination of rank constitute it power be highly injurious to morality a stand army for instance be incompatible with freedom because subordination and rigour be the very sinew of military discipline and despotism be necessary to give vigour to enterprises that one will direct a spirit inspire by romantic notion of honour a kind of morality found on the fashion of the age can only be felt by a few officer whilst the main body must be move by command like the wave of the sea for the strong wind of authority push the crowd of subaltern forward theyscarcely know or care why with headlong fury besides nothing can be so prejudicial to the moral of the inhabitant of country town a the occasional residence of a set of idle superficial young men whose only occupation be gallantry and whose polished manner render vice more dangerous by conceal it deformity under gay ornamental drapery an air of fashion which be but a badge of slavery and prove that the soul have not a strong individual character awes simple country people into an imitation of the vice when theycan not catch the slippery grace of politeness every corp be a chain of despot who submit and tyrannize without exercise their reason become dead weight of vice and folly on the community a man of rank or fortune sure of rise by interest have nothing to do but to pursue some extravagant freak whilst the needy gentleman who be to rise a the phrase turn by hi merit become a servile parasite or vile pander sailor the naval gentleman come under the same description only their vice assume a different and a grosser cast theybe more positively indolent when not discharge the ceremonial of their station whilst the insignificant fluttering of soldier may be term active idleness more confined to the society of men the former acquire a fondness for humour and mischievous trick whilst the latter mix frequently with wellbred woman catch a sentimental cant but mind be equally out of the question whether theyindulge the horselaugh or polite simper may i be allow to extend the comparison to a profession where more mind be certainly to be find for the clergy have superior opportunity of improvement though subordination almost equally cramp their faculty the blind submission impose at college to form of belief serf a a noviciate to the curate who most obsequiously respect the opinion of hi rector or patron if he mean to rise in hi profession perhaps there can not be a more forcible contrast than between the servile dependent gait of a poor curate and the courtly mien of a bishop and the respect and contempt theyinspire render the discharge of their separate function equally useless it be of great importance to observe that the character of every man be in some degree form by hi profession a man of sense may only have a cast of countenance that wear off a you trace hi individuality whilst the weak common man have scarcely ever any character but what belong to the body at least all hi opinion have be so steep in the vat consecrate by authority that the faint spirit which the grape of hi own vine yield can not be distinguish society therefore a it become more enlightened should be very careful not to establish body of men who must necessarily be make foolish or vicious by the very constitution of their profession in the infancy of society when men be just emerge out of barbarism chief and priest touch the most powerful spring of savage conducthope and fearmust have have unbounded sway an aristocracy of course be naturally the first form of government but clash interest soon lose their equipoise a monarchy and hierarchy break out of the confusion of ambitious struggle and the foundation of both be secure by feudal tenure this appear to be the origin of monarchial and priestly power and the dawn of civilization but such combustible material can not long be pen up and get vent in foreign war and intestine insurrection the people acquire some power in the tumult which oblige their ruler to gloss over their oppression with a show of right thus a war agriculture commerce and literature expand the mind despot be compel to make covert corruption hold fast the power which be formerly snatch by open force and this baneful lurking gangrene be most quickly spread by luxury and superstition the sure dreg of ambition the indolent puppet of a court first become a luxurious monster or fastidious sensualist and then make the contagion which hi unnatural state spread the instrument of tyranny it be the pestiferous purple which render the progress of civilization a curse and warp the understanding till men of sensibility doubt whether the expansion of intellect produce a great portion of happiness or misery but the nature of the poison point out the antidote and have rousseau mount one step higher in hi investigation or could hi eye have pierce through the foggy atmosphere which he almost disdain to breathe hi active mind would have dart forward to contemplate the perfection of man in the establishment of true civilization instead of take hi ferocious flight back to the night of sensual ignorance chapter the prevailing opinion of a sexual character discussed to account for and excuse the tyranny of man many ingenious argument have be bring forward to prove that the two sex in the acquirement of virtue ought to aim at attain a very different character or to speak explicitly woman be not allow to have sufficient strength of mind to acquire what really deserve the name of virtue yet it should seem allow them to have soul that there be but one way appoint by providence to lead mankind to either virtue or happiness if then woman be not a swarm of ephemeron trifler why should theybe keep in ignorance under the specious name of innocence men complain and with reason of the folly and caprice of our sex when theydo not keenly satirize our headstrong passion and grovel vice behold i should answer the natural effect of ignorance the mind will ever be unstable that have only prejudice to rest on and the current will run with destructive fury when there be no barrier to break it force woman be tell from their infancy and taught by the example of their mother that a little knowledge of human weakness justly term cunning softness of temper outward obedience and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety will obtain for them the protection of man and should theybe beautiful every thing els be needless for at least twenty year of their life thus milton describe our first frail mother though when he tell u that woman be form for softness and sweet attractive grace i can not comprehend hi meaning unless in the true mahometan strain he mean to deprive u of soul and insinuate that we be being only design by sweet attractive grace and docile blind obedience to gratify the sens of man when he can no longer soar on the wing of contemplation how grossly do theyinsult u who thus advise u only to render ourselves gentle domestic brute for instance the winning softness so warmly and frequently recommend that governs by obey what childish expression and how insignificant be the beingcan it be an immortal one who will condescend to govern by such sinister method certainly say lord bacon man be of kin to the beast by hi body and if he be not of kin to god by hi spirit he be a base and ignoble creature men indeed appear to me to act in a very unphilosophical manner when theytry to secure the good conduct of woman by attempt to keep them always in a state of childhood rousseau be more consistent when he wish to stop the progress of reason in both sex for if men eat of the tree of knowledge woman will come in for a taste but from the imperfect cultivation which their understanding now receive theyonly attain a knowledge of evil child i grant should be innocent but when the epithet be apply to men or woman it be but a civil term for weakness for if it be allow that woman be destine by providence to acquire human virtue and by the exercise of their understanding that stability of character which be the firm ground to rest our future hop upon theymust be permit to turn to the fountain of light and not force to shape their course by the twinkling of a mere satellite milton i grant be of a very different opinion for he only bend to the indefeasible right of beauty though it would be difficult to render two passage which i now mean to contrast consistent but into similar inconsistency be great men often lead by their sens to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorn my author and disposer what thou bidst unargued i obey so god ordain god be thy law thou mine to know no more be womans happy knowledge and her praise these be exactly the argument that i have use to child but i have add your reason be now gain strength and till it arrive at some degree of maturity you must look up to me for advice then you ought to think and only rely on god yet in the following line milton seem to coincide with me when he make adam thus expostulate with hi maker hast thou not make me here thy substitute and these inferior far beneath me set among unequals what society can sort what harmony or delight which must be mutual in proportion due given and receive but in disparity the one intense the other still remiss can not well suit with either but soon prove tedious alike of fellowship i speak such a i seek fit to participate all rational delight in treat therefore of the manner of woman let u disregard sensual argument trace what we should endeavour to make them in order to cooperate if the expression be not too bold with the supreme being by individual education i meanfor the sense of the word be not precisely definedsuch an attention to a child a will slowly sharpen the sens form the temper regulate the passion a theybegin to ferment and set the understanding to work before the body arrive at maturity so that the man may only have to proceed not to begin the important task of learn to think and reason to prevent any misconstruction i must add that i do not believe that a private education can work the wonder which some sanguine writer have attribute to it men and woman must be educate in a great degree by the opinion and manner of the society theylive in in every age there have be a stream of popular opinion that have carry all before it and give a family character a it be to the century it may then fairly be infer that till society be differently constitute much can not be expect from education it be however sufficient for my present purpose to assert that whatever effect circumstance have on the ability every be may become virtuous by the exercise of it own reason for if but one be be create with vicious inclinationsthat be positively bad what can save u from atheism or if we worship a god be not that god a devil consequently the most perfect education in my opinion be such an exercise of the understanding a be best calculate to strengthen the body and form the heart or in other word to enable the individual to attain such habit of virtue a will render it independent in fact it be a farce to call any be virtuous whose virtue do not result from the exercise of it own reason this be rousseau opinion respect men i extend it to woman and confidently assert that theyhave be draw out of their sphere by false refinement and not by an endeavour to acquire masculine quality still the regal homage which theyreceive be so intoxicating that till the manner of the time be change and form on more reasonable principle it may be impossible to convince them that the illegitimate power which theyobtain by degrade themselves be a curse and that theymust return to nature and equality if theywish to secure the placid satisfaction that unsophisticated affection impart but for this epoch we must waitwait perhaps till king and noble enlighten by reason and prefer the real dignity of man to childish state throw off their gaudy hereditary trapping and if then woman do not resign the arbitrary power of beauty theywill prove that theyhave le mind than man i may be accuse of arrogance still i must declare what i firmly believe that all the writer who have write on the subject of female education and manner from rousseau to dr gregory have contribute to render woman more artificial weak character than theywould otherwise have be and consequently more useless member of society i might have express this conviction in a low key but i be afraid it would have be the whine of affectation and not the faithful expression of my feeling of the clear result which experience and reflection have lead me to draw when i come to that division of the subject i shall advert to the passage that i more particularly disapprove of in the work of the author i have just allude to but it be first necessary to observe that my objection extend to the whole purport of those book which tend in my opinion to degrade one half of the human specie and render woman please at the expense of every solid virtue though to reason on rousseau ground if man do attain a degree of perfection of mind when hi body arrive at maturity it might be proper in order to make a man and hi wife one that she should rely entirely on hi understanding and the graceful ivy clasp the oak that support it would form a whole in which strength and beauty would be equally conspicuous but alas husband as well a their helpmate be often only overgrown child nay thanks to early debauchery scarcely men in their outward form and if the blind lead the blind one need not come from heaven to tell u the consequence many be the cause that in the present corrupt state of society contribute to enslave woman by cramp their understanding and sharpen their sens one perhaps that silently do more mischief than all the rest be their disregard of order to do every thing in an orderly manner be a most important precept which woman who generally speak receive only a disorderly kind of education seldom attend to with that degree of exactness that men who from their infancy be break into method observe this negligent kind of guesswork for what other epithet can be use to point out the random exertion of a sort of instinctive common sense never bring to the test of reason prevents their generalizing matter of fact so theydo today what theydo yesterday merely because theydo it yesterday this contempt of the understanding in early life have more baneful consequence than be commonly suppose for the little knowledge which woman of strong mind attain be from various circumstance of a more desultory kind than the knowledge of men and it be acquire more by sheer observation on real life than from compare what have be individually observe with the result of experience generalize by speculation lead by their dependent situation and domestic employment more into society what theylearn be rather by snatch and a learning be with them in general only a secondary thing theydo not pursue any one branch with that persevere ardour necessary to give vigour to the faculty and clearness to the judgment in the present state of society a little learning be require to support the character of a gentleman and boy be oblige to submit to a few year of discipline but in the education of woman the cultivation of the understanding be always subordinate to the acquirement of some corporeal accomplishment even while enervate by confinement and false notion of modesty the body be prevent from attain that grace and beauty which relax halfformed limb never exhibit besides in youth their faculty be not bring forward by emulation and have no serious scientific study if theyhave natural sagacity it be turn too soon on life and manner theydwell on effect and modification without trace them back to cause and complicate rule to adjust behaviour be a weak substitute for simple principle a a proof that education give this appearance of weakness to female we may instance the example of military men who be like them send into the world before their mind have be store with knowledge or fortify by principle the consequence be similar soldier acquire a little superficial knowledge snatch from the muddy current of conversation and from continually mix with society theygain what be term a knowledge of the world and this acquaintance with manner and custom have frequently be confound with a knowledge of the human heart but can the crude fruit of casual observation never bring to the test of judgment form by compare speculation and experience deserve such a distinction soldier as well a woman practice the minor virtue with punctilious politeness where be then the sexual difference when the education have be the same all the difference that i can discern arises from the superior advantage of liberty which enable the former to see more of life it be wander from my present subject perhaps to make a political remark but a it be produce naturally by the train of my reflection i shall not pass it silently over stand army can never consist of resolute robust men theymay be well disciplined machine but theywill seldom contain men under the influence of strong passion or with very vigorous faculty and a for any depth of understand i will venture to affirm that it be as rarely to be find in the army a amongst woman and the cause i maintain be the same it may be far observe that officer be also particularly attentive to their person fond of dance crowd room adventure and ridicule like the fair sex the business of their life be gallantry theybe teach to please and theyonly live to please yet theydo not lose their rank in the distinction of sex for theybe still reckon superior to woman though in what their superiority consist beyond what i have just mention it be difficult to discover the great misfortune be this that theyboth acquire manner before moral and a knowledge of life before theyhave from reflection any acquaintance with the grand ideal outline of human nature the consequence be natural satisfied with common nature theybecome a prey to prejudice and take all their opinion on credit theyblindly submit to authority so that if theyhave any sense it be a kind of instinctive glance that catch proportion and decides with respect to manner but fails when argument be to be pursue below the surface or opinion analyze may not the same remark be apply to woman nay the argument may be carry still far for theybe both thrown out of a useful station by the unnatural distinction establish in civilized life rich and hereditary honour have make cypher of woman to give consequence to the numerical figure and idleness have produce a mixture of gallantry and despotism in society which lead the very men who be the slave of their mistress to tyrannize over their sister wife and daughter this be only keep them in rank and file it be true strengthen the female mind by enlarge it and there will be an end to blind obedience but a blind obedience be ever seek for by power tyrant and sensualist be in the right when theyendeavour to keep woman in the dark because the former only want slave and the latter a plaything the sensualist indeed have be the most dangerous of tyrant and woman have be dupe by their lover a prince by their minister whilst dream that theyreign over them i now principally allude to rousseau for hi character of sophia be undoubtedly a captivate one though it appear to me grossly unnatural however it be not the superstructure but the foundation of her character the principle on which her education be build that i mean to attack nay warmly a i admire the genius of that able writer whose opinion i shall often have occasion to cite indignation always take place of admiration and the rigid frown of insulted virtue efface the smile of complacency which hi eloquent period be wont to raise when i read hi voluptuous revery be this the man who in hi ardour for virtue would banish all the soft art of peace and almost carry u back to spartan discipline be this the man who delight to paint the useful struggle of passion the triumph of good disposition and the heroic flight which carry the glowing soul out of itself how be these mighty sentiment lower when he describe the prettyfoot and entice air of hi little favourite but for the present i waive the subject and instead of severely reprehend the transient effusion of overweening sensibility i shall only observe that whoever have cast a benevolent eye on society must often have be gratify by the sight of humble mutual love not dignify by sentiment nor strengthen by a union in intellectual pursuit the domestic trifle of the day have afford matter for cheerful converse and innocent caress have soften toil which do not require great exercise of mind or stretch of thought yet have not the sight of this moderate felicity excite more tenderness than respect an emotion similar to what we feel when child be play or animal sport whilst the contemplation of the noble struggle of suffer merit have raise admiration and carry our thought to that world where sensation will give place to reason woman be therefore to be consider either a moral being or so weak that theymust be entirely subject to the superior faculty of men let u examine this question rousseau declare that a woman should never for a moment feel herself independent that she should be govern by fear to exercise her natural cunning and make a coquetish slave in order to render her a more alluring object of desire a sweeter companion to man whenever he choose to relax himself he carry the argument which he pretend to draw from the indication of nature still far and insinuate that truth and fortitude the corner stone of all human virtue shall be cultivate with certain restriction because with respect to the female character obedience be the grand lesson which ought to be impress with unrelenting rigour what nonsense when will a great man arise with sufficient strength of mind to puff away the fume which pride and sensuality have thus spread over the subject if woman be by nature inferior to men their virtue must be the same in quality if not in degree or virtue be a relative idea consequently their conduct should be found on the same principle and have the same aim connect with man a daughter wife and mother their moral character may be estimate by their manner of fulfil those simple duty but the end the grand end of their exertion should be to unfold their own faculty and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue theymay try to render their road pleasant but ought never to forget in common with man that life yield not the felicity which can satisfy an immortal soul i do not mean to insinuate that either sex should be so lose in abstract reflection or distant view a to forget the affection and duty that lie before them and be in truth the mean appoint to produce the fruit of life on the contrary i would warmly recommend them even while i assert that theyafford most satisfaction when theybe consider in their true subordinate light probably the prevailing opinion that woman be create for man may have take it rise from moses poetical story yet a very few it be presume who have bestow any serious thought on the subject ever suppose that eve be literally speak one of adam rib the deduction must be allow to fall to the ground or only be so far admit a it prove that man from the remote antiquity find it convenient to exert hi strength to subjugate hi companion and hi invention to show that she ought to have her neck bent under the yoke because she as well a the brute creation be create to do hi pleasure let it not be conclude that i wish to invert the order of thing i have already grant that from the constitution of their body men seem to be design by providence to attain a great degree of virtue i speak collectively of the whole sex but i see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtue should differ in respect to their nature in fact how can theyif virtue have only one eternal standard i must therefore if i reason consequentially a strenuously maintain that theyhave the same simple direction a that there be a god it follow then that cunning should not be oppose to wisdom little care to great exertion nor insipid softness varnish over with the name of gentleness to that fortitude which grand view alone can inspire i shall be tell that woman would then lose many of her peculiar grace and the opinion of a well know poet might be quote to refute my unqualified assertion for pope have say in the name of the whole male sex yet neer so sure our passion to create a when she touchd the brink of all we hate in what light this sally place men and woman i shall leave to the judicious to determine meanwhile i shall content myself with observe that i can not discover why unless theybe mortal female should always be degrade by be make subservient to love or lust to speak disrespectfully of love be i know high treason against sentiment and fine feeling but i wish to speak the simple language of truth and rather to address the head than the heart to endeavour to reason love out of the world would be to out quixote cervantes and equally offend against common sense but an endeavour to restrain this tumultuous passion and to prove that it should not be allow to dethrone superior power or to usurp the sceptre which the understanding should ever coolly wield appear less wild youth be the season for love in both sex but in those day of thoughtless enjoyment provision should be make for the more important year of life when reflection take place of sensation but rousseau and most of the male writer who have follow hi step have warmly inculcate that the whole tendency of female education ought to be direct to one point to render them please let me reason with the supporter of this opinion who have any knowledge of human nature do theyimagine that marriage can eradicate the habitude of life the woman who have only be teach to please will soon find that her charm be oblique sunbeam and that theycan not have much effect on her husband heart when theybe see every day when the summer be past and go will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort and cultivate her dormant faculty or be it not more rational to expect that she will try to please other men and in the emotion raise by the expectation of new conquest endeavour to forget the mortification her love or pride have receive when the husband cease to be a loverand the time will inevitably come her desire of please will then grow languid or become a spring of bitterness and love perhaps the most evanescent of all passion give place to jealousy or vanity i now speak of woman who be restrain by principle or prejudice such woman though theywould shrink from an intrigue with real abhorrence yet nevertheless wish to be convince by the homage of gallantry that theybe cruelly neglect by their husband or day and week be spend in dreaming of the happiness enjoy by congenial soul till the health be undermine and the spirit break by discontent how then can the great art of please be such a necessary study it be only useful to a mistress the chaste wife and serious mother should only consider her power to please a the polish of her virtue and the affection of her husband a one of the comfort that render her task less difficult and her life happier but whether she be love or neglect her first wish should be to make herself respectable and not rely for all her happiness on a be subject to like infirmity with herself the amiable dr gregory fell into a similar error i respect hi heart but entirely disapprove of hi celebrated legacy to hi daughter he advise them to cultivate a fondness for dress because a fondness for dress he assert be natural to them i be unable to comprehend what either he or rousseau mean when theyfrequently use this indefinite term if theytell u that in a preexistent state the soul be fond of dress and bring this inclination with it into a new body i should listen to them with a half smile a i often do when i hear a rant about innate elegance but if he only mean to say that the exercise of the faculty will produce this fondness i deny it it be not natural but arise like false ambition in men from a love of power dr gregory go much far he actually recommend dissimulation and advise an innocent girl to give the lie to her feeling and not dance with spirit when gaiety of heart would make her foot eloquent without make her gesture immodest in the name of truth and common sense why should not one woman acknowledge that she can take more exercise than another or in other word that she have a sound constitution and why to damp innocent vivacity be she darkly to be tell that men will draw conclusion which she little think of let the libertine draw what inference he please but i hope that no sensible mother will restrain the natural frankness of youth by instill such indecent caution out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and a wise than solomon hath say that the heart should be make clean and not trivial ceremony observe which it be not very difficult to fulfill with scrupulous exactness when vice reign in the heart woman ought to endeavour to purify their heart but can theydo so when their uncultivated understanding make them entirely dependent on their sens for employment and amusement when no noble pursuit set them above the little vanity of the day or enable them to curb the wild emotion that agitate a reed over which every passing breeze have power to gain the affection of a virtuous man be affectation necessary nature have give woman a weak frame than man but to ensure her husband affection must a wife who by the exercise of her mind and body whilst she be discharge the duty of a daughter wife and mother have allow her constitution to retain it natural strength and her nerve a healthy tone be she i say to condescend to use art and feign a sickly delicacy in order to secure her husband affection weakness may excite tenderness and gratify the arrogant pride of man but the lordly caress of a protector will not gratify a noble mind that pant for and deserves to be respect fondness be a poor substitute for friendship in a seraglio i grant that all these art be necessary the epicure must have hi palate tickle or he will sink into apathy but have woman so little ambition a to be satisfy with such a condition can theysupinely dream life away in the lap of pleasure or in the languor of weariness rather than assert their claim to pursue reasonable pleasure and render themselves conspicuous by practise the virtue which dignify mankind surely she have not an immortal soul who can loiter life away merely employ to adorn her person that she may amuse the languid hour and soften the care of a fellowcreature who be willing to be enliven by her smile and trick when the serious business of life be over besides the woman who strengthen her body and exercise her mind will by manage her family and practise various virtue become the friend and not the humble dependent of her husband and if she deserve hi regard by possess such substantial quality she will not find it necessary to conceal her affection nor to pretend to an unnatural coldness of constitution to excite her husband passion in fact if we revert to history we shall find that the woman who have distinguish themselves have neither be the most beautiful nor the most gentle of their sex nature or to speak with strict propriety god have make all thing right but man have seek him out many invention to mar the work i now allude to that part of dr gregory treatise where he advise a wife never to let her husband know the extent of her sensibility or affection voluptuous precaution and as ineffectual a absurd love from it very nature must be transitory to seek for a secret that would render it constant would be a wild a search a for the philosopher stone or the grand panacea and the discovery would be equally useless or rather pernicious to mankind the most holy band of society be friendship it have be well say by a shrewd satirist that rare a true love be true friendship be still rarer this be an obvious truth and the cause not lie deep will not elude a slight glance of inquiry love the common passion in which chance and sensation take place of choice and reason be in some degree felt by the mass of mankind for it be not necessary to speak at present of the emotion that rise above or sink below love this passion naturally increase by suspense and difficulty draw the mind out of it accustomed state and exalt the affection but the security of marriage allow the fever of love to subside a healthy temperature be think insipid only by those who have not sufficient intellect to substitute the calm tenderness of friendship the confidence of respect instead of blind admiration and the sensual emotion of fondness this be must be the course of naturefriendship or indifference inevitably succeed love and this constitution seem perfectly to harmonize with the system of government which prevail in the moral world passion be spur to action and open the mind but theysink into mere appetites become a personal momentary gratification when the object be gain and the satisfied mind rest in enjoyment the man who have some virtue whilst he be struggle for a crown often become a voluptuous tyrant when it grace hi brow and when the lover be not lose in the husband the dotard a prey to childish caprice and fond jealousy neglect the serious duty of life and the caress which should excite confidence in hi child be lavish on the overgrown child hi wife in order to fulfil the duty of life and to be able to pursue with vigour the various employment which form the moral character a master and mistress of a family ought not to continue to love each other with passion i mean to say that theyought not to indulge those emotion which disturb the order of society and engross the thought that should be otherwise employ the mind that have never be engross by one object want vigourif it can long be so it be weak a mistaken education a narrow uncultivated mind and many sexual prejudice tend to make woman more constant than men but for the present i shall not touch on this branch of the subject i will go still far and advance without dreaming of a paradox that an unhappy marriage be often very advantageous to a family and that the neglected wife be in general the best mother and this would almost always be the consequence if the female mind be more enlarged for it seem to be the common dispensation of providence that what we gain in present enjoyment should be deduct from the treasure of life experience and that when we be gather the flower of the day and revelling in pleasure the solid fruit of toil and wisdom should not be catch at the same time the way lie before u we must turn to the right or left and he who will pass life away in bound from one pleasure to another must not complain if he neither acquire wisdom nor respectability of character suppose for a moment that the soul be not immortal and that man be only create for the present scene i think we should have reason to complain that love infantine fondness ever grow insipid and pal upon the sense let u eat drink and love for tomorrow we die would be in fact the language of reason the morality of life and who but a fool would part with a reality for a fleeting shadow but if awe by observe the improvable power of the mind we disdain to confine our wish or thought to such a comparatively mean field of action that only appear grand and important a it be connect with a boundless prospect and sublime hope what necessity be there for falsehood in conduct and why must the sacred majesty of truth be violate to detain a deceitful good that sap the very foundation of virtue why must the female mind be taint by coquetish art to gratify the sensualist and prevent love from subside into friendship or compassionate tenderness when there be not quality on which friendship can be build let the honest heart show itself and reason teach passion to submit to necessity or let the dignified pursuit of virtue and knowledge raise the mind above those emotion which rather imbitter than sweeten the cup of life when theybe not restrain within due bound i do not mean to allude to the romantic passion which be the concomitant of genius who can clip it wing but that grand passion not proportion to the puny enjoyment of life be only true to the sentiment and feed on itself the passion which have be celebrate for their durability have always be unfortunate theyhave acquire strength by absence and constitutional melancholy the fancy have hover round a form of beauty dimly seenbut familiarity might have turn admiration into disgust or at least into indifference and allow the imagination leisure to start fresh game with perfect propriety accord to this view of thing do rousseau make the mistress of hi soul eloisa love st preux when life be fade before her but this be no proof of the immortality of the passion of the same complexion be dr gregory advice respect delicacy of sentiment which he advise a woman not to acquire if she have determine to marry this determination however perfectly consistent with hi former advice he call indelicate and earnestly persuade hi daughter to conceal it though it may govern their conduct a if it be indelicate to have the common appetite of human nature noble morality and consistent with the cautious prudence of a little soul that can not extend it view beyond the present minute division of existence if all the faculty of woman mind be only to be cultivate a theyrespect her dependence on man if when she obtain a husband she have arrive at her goal and meanly proud be satisfy with such a paltry crown let her grovel contentedly scarcely raise by her employment above the animal kingdom but if she be struggle for the prize of her high call let her cultivate her understand without stop to consider what character the husband may have whom she be destine to marry let her only determine without be too anxious about present happiness to acquire the quality that ennoble a rational be and a rough inelegant husband may shock her taste without destroy her peace of mind she will not model her soul to suit the frailty of her companion but to bear with them hi character may be a trial but not an impediment to virtue if dr gregory confine hi remark to romantic expectation of constant love and congenial feeling he should have recollect that experience will banish what advice can never make u cease to wish for when the imagination be keep alive at the expence of reason i own it frequently happen that woman who have foster a romantic unnatural delicacy of feel waste their life in imagining how happy theyshould have be with a husband who could love them with a fervid increase affection every day and all day but theymight as well pine marry a single and would not be a jot more unhappy with a bad husband than long for a good one that a proper education or to speak with more precision a well store mind would enable a woman to support a single life with dignity i grant but that she should avoid cultivate her taste l her husband should occasionally shock it be quit a substance for a shadow to say the truth i do not know of what use be an improved taste if the individual be not render more independent of the casualty of life if new source of enjoyment only dependent on the solitary operation of the mind be not open people of taste marry or single without distinction will ever be disgust by various thing that touch not less observe mind on this conclusion the argument must not be allow to hinge but in the whole sum of enjoyment be taste to be denominate a bless the question be whether it procure most pain or pleasure the answer will decide the propriety of dr gregory advice and show how absurd and tyrannic it be thus to lay down a system of slavery or to attempt to educate moral being by any other rule than those deduce from pure reason which apply to the whole specie gentleness of manner forbearance and long suffering be such amiable godlike quality that in sublime poetic strain the deity have be invest with them and perhaps no representation of hi goodness so strongly fasten on the human affection a those that represent him abundant in mercy and willing to pardon gentleness consider in this point of view bear on it front all the characteristic of grandeur combine with the win grace of condescension but what a different aspect it assume when it be the submissive demeanour of dependence the support of weakness that love because it want protection and be forbear because it must silently endure injury smile under the lash at which it dare not snarl abject a this picture appear it be the portrait of an accomplished woman accord to the received opinion of female excellence separate by specious reasoner from human excellence or theyvide rousseau and swedenborg kindly restore the rib and make one moral be of a man and woman not forget to give her all the submissive charm how woman be to exist in that state where there be to be neither marry nor give in marriage we be not tell for though moralist have agree that the tenor of life seem to prove that man be prepare by various circumstance for a future state theyconstantly concur in advise woman only to provide for the present gentleness docility and a spaniellike affection be on this ground consistently recommend a the cardinal virtue of the sex and disregard the arbitrary economy of nature one writer have declare that it be masculine for a woman to be melancholy she be create to be the toy of man hi rattle and it must jingle in hi ear whenever dismiss reason he choose to be amuse to recommend gentleness indeed on a broad basis be strictly philosophical a frail be should labour to be gentle but when forbearance confounds right and wrong it cease to be a virtue and however convenient it may be find in a companion that companion will ever be consider a an inferior and only inspire a vapid tenderness which easily degenerate into contempt still if advice could really make a be gentle whose natural disposition admit not of such a fine polish something toward the advancement of order would be attain but if as might quickly be demonstrate only affectation be produce by this indiscriminate counsel which throw a stumbling block in the way of gradual improvement and true melioration of temper the sex be not much benefit by sacrifice solid virtue to the attainment of superficial grace though for a few year theymay procure the individual regal sway a a philosopher i read with indignation the plausible epithet which men use to soften their insult and a a moralist i ask what be mean by such heterogeneous association a fair defect amiable weakness etc if there be but one criterion of moral but one archetype for man woman appear to be suspend by destiny accord to the vulgar tale of mahomet coffin theyhave neither the unerring instinct of brute nor be allow to fix the eye of reason on a perfect model theybe make to be love and must not aim at respect l theyshould be hunt out of society a masculine but to view the subject in another point of view do passive indolent woman make the best wife confine our discussion to the present moment of existence let u see how such weak creature perform their part do the woman who by the attainment of a few superficial accomplishment have strengthen the prevailing prejudice merely contribute to the happiness of their husband do theydisplay their charm merely to amuse them and have woman who have early imbibed notion of passive obedience sufficient character to manage a family or educate child so far from it that after survey the history of woman i can not help agree with the severe satirist consider the sex a the weakest as well a the most oppressed half of the specie what do history disclose but mark of inferiority and how few woman have emancipate themselves from the gall yoke of sovereign man so few that the exception remind me of an ingenious conjecture respect newton that he be probably a be of a superior order accidentally cage in a human body in the same style i have be lead to imagine that the few extraordinary woman who have rush in eccentrical direction out of the orbit prescribe to their sex be male spirit confine by mistake in a female frame but if it be not philosophical to think of sex when the soul be mention the inferiority must depend on the organ or the heavenly fire which be to ferment the clay be not give in equal portion but avoid a i have hitherto do any direct comparison of the two sex collectively or frankly acknowledge the inferiority of woman accord to the present appearance of thing i shall only insist that men have increase that inferiority till woman be almost sunk below the standard of rational creature let their faculty have room to unfold and their virtue to gain strength and then determine where the whole sex must stand in the intellectual scale yet let it be remember that for a small number of distinguished woman i do not ask a place it be difficult for u purblind mortal to say to what height human discovery and improvement may arrive when the gloom of despotism subsides which make u stumble at every step but when morality shall be settle on a more solid basis then without be gift with a prophetic spirit i will venture to predict that woman will be either the friend or slave of man we shall not a at present doubt whether she be a moral agent or the link which unite man with brute but should it then appear that like the brute theybe principally create for the use of man he will let them patiently bite the bridle and not mock them with empty praise or should their rationality be prove he will not impede their improvement merely to gratify hi sensual appetites he will not with all the grace of rhetoric advise them to submit implicitly their understanding to the guidance of man he will not when he treat of the education of woman assert that theyought never to have the free use of reason nor would he recommend cunning and dissimulation to being who be acquire in like manner a himself the virtue of humanity surely there can be but one rule of right if morality have an eternal foundation and whoever sacrifice virtue strictly so call to present convenience or whose duty it be to act in such a manner live only for the passing day and can not be an accountable creature the poet then should have drop hi sneer when he say if weak woman go astray the star be more in fault than theyfor that theybe bind by the adamantine chain of destiny be most certain if it be prove that theybe never to exercise their own reason never to be independent never to rise above opinion or to feel the dignity of a rational will that only bow to god and often forget that the universe contain any be but itself and the model of perfection to which it ardent gaze be turn to adore attribute that soften into virtue may be imitate in kind though the degree overwhelms the enraptured mind if i say for i would not impress by declamation when reason offer her sober light if theybe really capable of act like rational creature let them not be treat like slave or like the brute who be dependent on the reason of man when theyassociate with him but cultivate their mind give them the salutary sublime curb of principle and let them attain conscious dignity by feel themselves only dependent on god teach them in common with man to submit to necessity instead of give to render them more please a sex to moral further should experience prove that theycan not attain the same degree of strength of mind perseverance and fortitude let their virtue be the same in kind though theymay vainly struggle for the same degree and the superiority of man will be equally clear if not clear and truth a it be a simple principle which admit of no modification would be common to both nay the order of society a it be at present regulate would not be invert for woman would then only have the rank that reason assign her and art could not be practise to bring the balance even much less to turn it these may be term utopian dream thanks to that be who impress them on my soul and give me sufficient strength of mind to dare to exert my own reason till become dependent only on him for the support of my virtue i view with indignation the mistaken notion that enslave my sex i love man a my fellow but hi sceptre real or usurped extends not to me unless the reason of an individual demand my homage and even then the submission be to reason and not to man in fact the conduct of an accountable be must be regulate by the operation of it own reason or on what foundation rest the throne of god it appear to me necessary to dwell on these obvious truth because female have be insult a it be and while theyhave be strip of the virtue that should clothe humanity theyhave be deck with artificial grace that enable them to exercise a short live tyranny love in their bosom take place of every nobler passion their sole ambition be to be fair to raise emotion instead of inspire respect and this ignoble desire like the servility in absolute monarchy destroy all strength of character liberty be the mother of virtue and if woman be by their very constitution slave and not allow to breathe the sharp invigorating air of freedom theymust ever languish like exotics and be reckon beautiful flaw in nature let it also be remember that theybe the only flaw a to the argument respect the subjection in which the sex have ever be hold it retort on man the many have always be enthral by the few and monster who have scarcely show any discernment of human excellence have tyrannize over thousand of their fellow creature why have men of superior endowment submit to such degradation for be it not universally acknowledge that king view collectively have ever be inferior in ability and virtue to the same number of men take from the common mass of mankindyet have theynot and be theynot still treat with a degree of reverence that be an insult to reason china be not the only country where a living man have be make a god men have submit to superior strength to enjoy with impunity the pleasure of the momentwomen have only do the same and therefore till it be prove that the courtier who servilely resign the birthright of a man be not a moral agent it can not be demonstrate that woman be essentially inferior to man because she have always be subjugate brutal force have hitherto govern the world and that the science of politics be in it infancy be evident from philosopher scruple to give the knowledge most useful to man that determinate distinction i shall not pursue this argument any further than to establish an obvious inference that a sound politics diffuse liberty mankind include woman will become more wise and virtuous chapter the same subject continued bodily strength from be the distinction of hero be now sunk into such unmerited contempt that men as well a woman seem to think it unnecessary the latter a it take from their feminine grace and from that lovely weakness the source of their undue power and the former because it appear inimical with the character of a gentleman that theyhave both by depart from one extreme run into another may easily be prove but it first may be proper to observe that a vulgar error have obtain a degree of credit which have give force to a false conclusion in which an effect have be mistake for a cause people of genius have very frequently impair their constitution by study or careless inattention to their health and the violence of their passion bear a proportion to the vigour of their intellect the sword destroy the scabbard have become almost proverbial and superficial observer have infer from thence that men of genius have commonly weak or to use a more fashionable phrase delicate constitution yet the contrary i believe will appear to be the fact for on diligent inquiry i find that strength of mind have in most case be accompany by superior strength of body natural soundness of constitution not that robust tone of nerve and vigour of muscle which arise from bodily labour when the mind be quiescent or only direct the hand dr priestley have remark in the preface to hi biographical chart that the majority of great men have live beyond fortyfive and consider the thoughtless manner in which theylavish their strength when investigate a favourite science theyhave waste the lamp of life forgetful of the midnight hour or when lose in poetic dream fancy have people the scene and the soul have be disturb till it shake the constitution by the passion that meditation have raise whose object the baseless fabric of a vision fade before the exhaust eye theymust have have iron frame shakespeare never grasp the airy dagger with a nerveless hand nor do milton tremble when he lead satan far from the confines of hi dreary prison these be not the raving of imbecility the sickly effusion of distempered brain but the exuberance of fancy that in a fine phrenzy wandering be not continually remind of it material shackle i be aware that this argument would carry me further than it may be suppose i wish to go but i follow truth and still adhere to my first position i will allow that bodily strength seem to give man a natural superiority over woman and this be the only solid basis on which the superiority of the sex can be build but i still insist that not only the virtue but the knowledge of the two sex should be the same in nature if not in degree and that woman consider not only a moral but rational creature ought to endeavour to acquire human virtue or perfection by the same mean a men instead of be educate like a fanciful kind of half be one of rousseau wild chimera but if strength of body be with some show of reason the boast of men why be woman so infatuated a to be proud of a defect rousseau have furnish them with a plausible excuse which could only have occur to a man whose imagination have be allow to run wild and refine on the impression make by exquisite sens that theymight forsooth have a pretext for yield to a natural appetite without violate a romantic specie of modesty which gratify the pride and libertinism of man woman delude by these sentiment sometimes boast of their weakness cunningly obtain power by play on the weakness of men and theymay well glory in their illicit sway for like turkish bashaws theyhave more real power than their master but virtue be sacrifice to temporary gratification and the respectability of life to the triumph of an hour woman as well a despot have now perhaps more power than theywould have if the world divide and subdivide into kingdom and family be govern by law deduce from the exercise of reason but in obtain it to carry on the comparison their character be degrade and licentiousness spread through the whole aggregate of society the many become pedestal to the few i therefore will venture to assert that till woman be more rationally educate the progress of human virtue and improvement in knowledge must receive continual check and if it be grant that woman be not create merely to gratify the appetite of man nor to be the upper servant who provide hi meal and take care of hi linen it must follow that the first care of those mother or father who really attend to the education of female should be if not to strengthen the body at least not to destroy the constitution by mistaken notion of beauty and female excellence nor should girls ever be allow to imbibe the pernicious notion that a defect can by any chemical process of reason become an excellence in this respect i be happy to find that the author of one of the most instructive book that our country have produce for child coincides with me in opinion i shall quote hi pertinent remark to give the force of hi respectable authority to reason but selene education be regulate by different view and conduct upon severer principle if that can be call severity which open the mind to a sense of moral and religious duty and most effectually arm it against the inevitable evil of lifemr day sandford and merton volume but should it be prove that woman be naturally weak than man from whence do it follow that it be natural for her to labour to become still weak than nature intend her to be argument of this cast be an insult to common sense and savour of passion the divine right of husband like the divine right of king may it be to be hop in this enlightened age be contest without danger and though conviction may not silence many boisterous disputant yet when any prevailing prejudice be attack the wise will consider and leave the narrowminded to rail with thoughtless vehemence at innovation the mother who wish to give true dignity of character to her daughter must regardless of the sneer of ignorance proceed on a plan diametrically opposite to that which rousseau have recommend with all the delude charm of eloquence and philosophical sophistry for hi eloquence render absurdity plausible and hi dogmatic conclusion puzzle without convince those who have not ability to refute them throughout the whole animal kingdom every young creature require almost continual exercise and the infancy of child conformable to this intimation should be pass in harmless gambol that exercise the foot and hand without require very minute direction from the head or the constant attention of a nurse in fact the care necessary for selfpreservation be the first natural exercise of the understanding a little invention to amuse the present moment unfold the imagination but these wise design of nature be counteract by mistaken fondness or blind zeal the child be not leave a moment to it own direction particularly a girl and thus render dependentdependence be call natural to preserve personal beauty woman glory the limb and faculty be cramp with bad than chinese band and the sedentary life which theybe condemn to live whilst boy frolic in the open air weaken the muscle and relax the nerve a for rousseau remark which have since be echo by several writer that theyhave naturally that be from their birth independent of education a fondness for doll dress and talk theybe so puerile a not to merit a serious refutation that a girl condemn to sit for hour together listen to the idle chat of weak nurse or to attend at her mother toilet will endeavour to join the conversation be indeed very natural and that she will imitate her mother or aunt and amuse herself by adorn her lifeless doll a theydo in dress her poor innocent babe be undoubtedly a most natural consequence for men of the great ability have seldom have sufficient strength to rise above the surround atmosphere and if the page of genius have always be blur by the prejudice of the age some allowance should be make for a sex who like king always see thing through a false medium in this manner may the fondness for dress conspicuous in woman be easily account for without suppose it the result of a desire to please the sex on which theybe dependent the absurdity in short of suppose that a girl be naturally a coquette and that a desire connect with the impulse of nature to propagate the specie should appear even before an improper education have by heat the imagination call it forth prematurely be so unphilosophical that such a sagacious observer a rousseau would not have adopt it if he have not be accustom to make reason give way to hi desire of singularity and truth to a favourite paradox yet thus to give a sex to mind be not very consistent with the principle of a man who argue so warmly and so well for the immortality of the soul but what a weak barrier be truth when it stand in the way of an hypothesis rousseau respectedalmost adore virtueand yet allow himself to love with sensual fondness hi imagination constantly prepare inflammable fuel for hi inflammable sens but in order to reconcile hi respect for selfdenial fortitude and those heroic virtue which a mind like hi could not coolly admire he labour to invert the law of nature and broach a doctrine pregnant with mischief and derogatory to the character of supreme wisdom hi ridiculous story which tend to prove that girl be naturally attentive to their person without lay any stress on daily example be below contempt and that a little miss should have such a correct taste a to neglect the pleasing amusement of make o merely because she perceive that it be an ungraceful attitude should be select with the anecdote of the learned pig i have probably have an opportunity of observe more girl in their infancy than j j rousseau i can recollect my own feeling and i have look steadily around me yet so far from coincide with him in opinion respect the first dawn of the female character i will venture to affirm that a girl whose spirit have not be damp by inactivity or innocence taint by false shame will always be a romp and the doll will never excite attention unless confinement allow her no alternative girl and boy in short would play harmless together if the distinction of sex be not inculcate long before nature make any difference i will go far and affirm a an indisputable fact that most of the woman in the circle of my observation who have act like rational creature or show any vigour of intellect have accidentally be allow to run wild a some of the elegant former of the fair sex would insinuate the baneful consequence which flow from inattention to health during infancy and youth extend further than be suppose dependence of body naturally produce dependence of mind and how can she be a good wife or mother the great part of whose time be employ to guard against or endure sickness nor can it be expect that a woman will resolutely endeavour to strengthen her constitution and abstain from enervate indulgence if artificial notion of beauty and false description of sensibility have be early entangled with her motif of action most men be sometimes oblige to bear with bodily inconvenience and to endure occasionally the inclemency of the element but genteel woman be literally speak slave to their body and glory in their subjection i once know a weak woman of fashion who be more than commonly proud of her delicacy and sensibility she think a distinguishing taste and puny appetite the height of all human perfection and act accordingly i have see this weak sophisticated be neglect all the duty of life yet recline with selfcomplacency on a sofa and boast of her want of appetite a a proof of delicacy that extend to or perhaps arose from her exquisite sensibility for it be difficult to render intelligible such ridiculous jargon yet at the moment i have see her insult a worthy old gentlewoman whom unexpected misfortune have make dependent on her ostentatious bounty and who in good day have claim on her gratitude be it possible that a human creature should have become such a weak and deprave be if like the sybarite dissolve in luxury every thing like virtue have not be wear away or never impress by precept a poor substitute it be true for cultivation of mind though it serve a a fence against vice such a woman be not a more irrational monster than some of the roman emperor who be deprave by lawless power yet since king have be more under the restraint of law and the curb however weak of honour the record of history be not fill with such unnatural instance of folly and cruelty nor do the despotism that kill virtue and genius in the bud hover over europe with that destructive blast which desolate turkey and render the men as well a the soil unfruitful woman be every where in this deplorable state for in order to preserve their innocence a ignorance be courteously term truth be hide from them and theybe make to assume an artificial character before their faculty have acquire any strength taught from their infancy that beauty be woman sceptre the mind shape itself to the body and roam round it gilt cage only seek to adorn it prison men have various employment and pursuit which engage their attention and give a character to the opening mind but woman confine to one and have their thought constantly direct to the most insignificant part of themselves seldom extend their view beyond the triumph of the hour but be their understanding once emancipate from the slavery to which the pride and sensuality of man and their short sight desire like that of dominion in tyrant of present sway have subject them we should probably read of their weakness with surprise i must be allow to pursue the argument a little farther perhaps if the existence of an evil be be allow who in the allegorical language of scripture go about seek whom he should devour he could not more effectually degrade the human character than by give a man absolute power this argument branch into various ramification birth rich and every intrinsic advantage that exalt a man above hi fellow without any mental exertion sink him in reality below them in proportion to hi weakness he be play upon by design men till the bloated monster have lose all trace of humanity and that tribe of men like flock of sheep should quietly follow such a leader be a solecism that only a desire of present enjoyment and narrowness of understand can solve educate in slavish dependence and enervate by luxury and sloth where shall we find men who will stand forth to assert the right of man or claim the privilege of moral being who should have but one road to excellence slavery to monarchs and minister which the world will be long in free itself from and whose deadly grasp stop the progress of the human mind be not yet abolish let not men then in the pride of power use the same argument that tyrannic king and venal minister have use and fallaciously assert that woman ought to be subject because she have always be so but when man govern by reasonable law enjoy hi natural freedom let him despise woman if she do not share it with him and till that glorious period arrive in descant on the folly of the sex let him not overlook hi own woman it be true obtain power by unjust mean by practise or foster vice evidently lose the rank which reason would assign them and theybecome either abject slave or capricious tyrant theylose all simplicity all dignity of mind in acquire power and act a men be observe to act when theyhave be exalt by the same mean it be time to effect a revolution in female manner time to restore to them their lose dignity and make them a a part of the human specie labour by reform themselves to reform the world it be time to separate unchangeable moral from local manner if men be demigod why let u serve them and if the dignity of the female soul be as disputable a that of animal if their reason do not afford sufficient light to direct their conduct whilst unerring instinct be deny theybe surely of all creatures the most miserable and bent beneath the iron hand of destiny must submit to be a fair defect in creation but to justify the way of providence respect them by point out some irrefragable reason for thus make such a large portion of mankind accountable and not accountable would puzzle the subtle casuist the only solid foundation for morality appear to be the character of the supreme being the harmony of which arise from a balance of attribute and to speak with reverence one attribute seem to imply the necessity of another he must be just because he be wise he must be good because he be omnipotent for to exalt one attribute at the expense of another equally noble and necessary bear the stamp of the warped reason of man the homage of passion man accustom to bow down to power in hi savage state can seldom divest himself of this barbarous prejudice even when civilization determine how much superior mental be to bodily strength and hi reason be cloud by these crude opinion even when he think of the deity hi omnipotence be make to swallow up or preside over hi other attribute and those mortal be suppose to limit hi power irreverently who think that it must be regulate by hi wisdom i disclaim that specie of humility which after investigate nature stop at the author the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity doubtless possess many attribute of which we can form no conception but reason tell me that theycan not clash with those i adore and i be compel to listen to her voice it seem natural for man to search for excellence and either to trace it in the object that he worship or blindly to invest it with perfection a a garment but what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational be he bend to power he adore a dark cloud which may open a bright prospect to him or burst in angry lawless fury on hi devoted head he know not why and supposing that the deity act from the vague impulse of an undirected will man must also follow hi own or act accord to rule deduce from principle which he disclaim a irreverent into this dilemma have both enthusiast and cooler thinker fall when theylabour to free men from the wholesome restraint which a just conception of the character of god impose it be not impious thus to scan the attribute of the almighty in fact who can avoid it that exercise hi faculty for to love god a the fountain of wisdom goodness and power appear to be the only worship useful to a be who wish to acquire either virtue or knowledge a blind unsettled affection may like human passion occupy the mind and warm the heart whilst to do justice love mercy and walk humbly with our god be forget i shall pursue this subject still far when i consider religion in a light opposite to that recommend by dr gregory who treat it a a matter of sentiment or taste to return from this apparent digression it be to be wish that woman would cherish an affection for their husband found on the same principle that devotion ought to rest upon no other firm base be there under heaven for let them beware of the fallacious light of sentiment too often use a a soft phrase for sensuality it follow then i think that from their infancy woman should either be shut up like eastern prince or educate in such a manner a to be able to think and act for themselves why do men halt between two opinion and expect impossibility why do theyexpect virtue from a slave or from a be whom the constitution of civil society have render weak if not vicious still i know that it will require a considerable length of time to eradicate the firmly root prejudice which sensualist have plant it will also require some time to convince woman that theyact contrary to their real interest on an enlarge scale when theycherish or affect weakness under the name of delicacy and to convince the world that the poisoned source of female vice and folly if it be necessary in compliance with custom to use synonymous term in a lax sense have be the sensual homage pay to beauty to beauty of feature for it have be shrewdly observe by a german writer that a pretty woman a an object of desire be generally allow to be so by men of all description whilst a fine woman who inspire more sublime emotion by display intellectual beauty may be overlook or observe with indifference by those men who find their happiness in the gratification of their appetite i foresee an obvious retort whilst man remain such an imperfect be a he appear hitherto to have be he will more or less be the slave of hi appetite and those woman obtain most power who gratify a predominant one the sex be degrade by a physical if not by a moral necessity this objection have i grant some force but while such a sublime precept exist a be pure a your heavenly father be pure it would seem that the virtue of man be not limit by the being who alone could limit them and that he may press forward without consider whether he step out of hi sphere by indulge such a noble ambition to the wild billow it have be say thus far shalt thou go and no further and here shall thy proud wave be stay vainly then do theybeat and foam restrain by the power that confine the struggle planet within their orbit matter yield to the great governing spirit but an immortal soul not restrain by mechanical law and struggle to free itself from the shackle of matter contributes to instead of disturb the order of creation when cooperate with the father of spirit it try to govern itself by the invariable rule that in a degree before which our imagination faint the universe be regulate besides if woman be educate for dependence that be to act accord to the will of another fallible be and submit right or wrong to power where be we to stop are theyto be consider a viceregents allow to reign over a small domain and answerable for their conduct to a high tribunal liable to error it will not be difficult to prove that such delegate will act like men subject by fear and make their child and servant endure their tyrannical oppression a theysubmit without reason theywill have no fixed rule to square their conduct by be kind or cruel just a the whim of the moment directs and we ought not to wonder if sometimes gall by their heavy yoke theytake a malignant pleasure in rest it on weak shoulder but suppose a woman train up to obedience be marry to a sensible man who direct her judgment without make her feel the servility of her subjection to act with as much propriety by this reflected light a can be expect when reason be take at second hand yet she can not ensure the life of her protector he may die and leave her with a large family a double duty devolves on her to educate them in the character of both father and mother to form their principle and secure their property but ala she have never think much less acted for herself she have only learn to please men to depend gracefully on them yet encumber with child how be she to obtain another protector a husband to supply the place of reason a rational man for we be not tread on romantic ground though he may think her a pleasing docile creature will not choose to marry a family for love when the world contain many more pretty creature what be then to become of her she either fall an easy prey to some mean fortune hunter who defraud her child of their paternal inheritance and render her miserable or become the victim of discontent and blind indulgence unable to educate her son or impress them with respect for it be not a play on word to assert that people be never respect though fill an important station who be not respectable she pin under the anguish of unavailing impotent regret the serpent tooth enters into her very soul and the vice of licentious youth bring her with sorrow if not with poverty also to the grave this be not an overcharged picture on the contrary it be a very possible case and something similar must have fall under every attentive eye i have however take it for grant that she be well disposed though experience show that the blind may a easily be lead into a ditch a along the beaten road but suppose no very improbable conjecture that a be only taught to please must still find her happiness in please what an example of folly not to say vice will she be to her innocent daughter the mother will be lose in the coquette and instead of make friend of her daughter view them with eye askance for theybe rivalsrivals more cruel than any other because theyinvite a comparison and drive her from the throne of beauty who have never think of a seat on the bench of reason it do not require a lively pencil or the discriminating outline of a caricature to sketch the domestic misery and petty vice which such a mistress of a family diffuse still she only act a a woman ought to act bring up accord to rousseau system she can never be reproach for be masculine or turn out of her sphere nay she may observe another of hi grand rule and cautiously preserve her reputation free from spot be reckon a good kind of woman yet in what respect can she be term good she abstain it be true without any great struggle from commit gross crime but how do she fulfil her duty dutiesin truth she have enough to think of to adorn her body and nurse a weak constitution with respect to religion she never presume to judge for herself but conform a a dependent creature should to the ceremony of the church which she be bring up in piously believe that wise head than her own have settle that business and not to doubt be her point of perfection she therefore pay her tythe of mint and cummin and thank her god that she be not a other woman be these be the blessed effect of a good education these the virtue of man helpmate i must relieve myself by draw a different picture let fancy now present a woman with a tolerable understanding for i do not wish to leave the line of mediocrity whose constitution strengthen by exercise have allow her body to acquire it full vigour her mind at the same time gradually expand itself to comprehend the moral duty of life and in what human virtue and dignity consist formed thus by the relative duty of her station she marry from affection without lose sight of prudence and look beyond matrimonial felicity she secure her husband respect before it be necessary to exert mean art to please him and fee a dying flame which nature doom to expire when the object become familiar when friendship and forbearance take place of a more ardent affection this be the natural death of love and domestic peace be not destroy by struggle to prevent it extinction i also suppose the husband to be virtuous or she be still more in want of independent principle fate however break this tie she be leave a widow perhaps without a sufficient provision but she be not desolate the pang of nature be felt but after time have soften sorrow into melancholy resignation her heart turn to her child with redoubled fondness and anxious to provide for them affection give a sacred heroic cast to her maternal duty she think that not only the eye see her virtuous effort from whom all her comfort now must flow and whose approbation be life but her imagination a little abstracted and exalt by grief dwells on the fond hope that the eye which her trembling hand close may still see how she subdue every wayward passion to fulfil the double duty of be the father as well a the mother of her child raise to heroism by misfortune she repress the first faint dawning of a natural inclination before it ripen into love and in the bloom of life forgets her sexforgets the pleasure of an awaken passion which might again have be inspire and return she no longer think of pleasing and conscious dignity prevent her from pride herself on account of the praise which her conduct demand her child have her love and her bright hope be beyond the grave where her imagination often stray i think i see her surround by her child reap the reward of her care the intelligent eye meet hers whilst health and innocence smile on their chubby cheek and a theygrow up the care of life be lessen by their grateful attention she live to see the virtue which she endeavour to plant on principle fix into habit to see her child attain a strength of character sufficient to enable them to endure adversity without forget their mother example the task of life thus fulfil she calmly wait for the sleep of death and rise from the grave may say behold thou gavest me a talent and here be five talent i wish to sum up what i have say in a few word for i here throw down my gauntlet and deny the existence of sexual virtue not except modesty for man and woman truth if i understand the meaning of the word must be the same yet the fanciful female character so prettily draw by poet and novelist demand the sacrifice of truth and sincerity virtue become a relative idea have no other foundation than utility and of that utility men pretend arbitrarily to judge shape it to their own convenience woman i allow may have different duty to fulfil but theybe human duty and the principle that should regulate the discharge of them i sturdily maintain must be the same to become respectable the exercise of their understanding be necessary there be no other foundation for independence of character i mean explicitly to say that theymust only bow to the authority of reason instead of be the modest slave of opinion in the superior rank of life how seldom do we meet with a man of superior ability or even common acquirement the reason appear to me clear the state theybe bear in be an unnatural one the human character have ever be form by the employment the individual or class pursues and if the faculty be not sharpen by necessity theymust remain obtuse the argument may fairly be extend to woman for seldom occupy by serious business the pursuit of pleasure give that insignificancy to their character which render the society of the great so insipid the same want of firmness produce by a similar cause force them both to fly from themselves to noisy pleasure and artificial passion till vanity take place of every social affection and the characteristic of humanity can scarcely be discern such be the blessing of civil government a theybe at present organize that wealth and female softness equally tend to debase mankind and be produce by the same cause but allow woman to be rational creature theyshould be incite to acquire virtue which theymay call their own for how can a rational be be ennoble by any thing that be not obtain by it own exertion chapter observation on the state of degradation to which woman is reduced by various cause that woman be naturally weak or degrade by a concurrence of circumstance be i think clear but this position i shall simply contrast with a conclusion which i have frequently hear fall from sensible men in favour of an aristocracy that the mass of mankind can not be any thing or the obsequious slave who patiently allow themselves to be pen up would feel their own consequence and spurn their chain men theyfurther observe submit every where to oppression when theyhave only to lift up their head to throw off the yoke yet instead of assert their birthright theyquietly lick the dust and say let u eat and drink for tomorrow we die woman i argue from analogy be degrade by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment and at last despise the freedom which theyhave not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain but i must be more explicit with respect to the culture of the heart it be unanimously allow that sex be out of the question but the line of subordination in the mental power be never to be pass over only absolute in loveliness the portion of rationality grant to woman be indeed very scanty for deny her genius and judgment it be scarcely possible to divine what remain to characterize intellect the stamen of immortality if i may be allow the phrase be the perfectibility of human reason for be man create perfect or do a flood of knowledge break in upon him when he arrive at maturity that preclude error i should doubt whether hi existence would be continue after the dissolution of the body but in the present state of thing every difficulty in moral that escape from human discussion and equally baffle the investigation of profound thinking and the lightning glance of genius be an argument on which i build my belief of the immortality of the soul reason be consequentially the simple power of improvement or more properly speaking of discern truth every individual be in this respect a world in itself more or less may be conspicuous in one be than other but the nature of reason must be the same in all if it be an emanation of divinity the tie that connect the creature with the creator for can that soul be stamp with the heavenly image that be not perfect by the exercise of it own reason yet outwardly ornament with elaborate care and so adorned to delight man that with honour he may love vide milton the soul of woman be not allow to have this distinction and man ever place between her and reason she be always represent a only create to see through a gross medium and to take thing on trust but dismiss these fanciful theory and consider woman a a whole let it be what it will instead of a part of man the inquiry be whether she have reason or not if she have which for a moment i will take for grant she be not create merely to be the solace of man and the sexual should not destroy the human character into this error men have probably be lead by view education in a false light not consider it a the first step to form a be advance gradually toward perfection this word be not strictly just but i can not find a good but only a a preparation for life on this sensual error for i must call it so have the false system of female manner be rear which rob the whole sex of it dignity and class the brown and fair with the smile flower that only adorn the land this have ever be the language of men and the fear of depart from a suppose sexual character have make even woman of superior sense adopt the same sentiment thus understand strictly speak have be deny to woman and instinct sublimate into wit and cunning for the purpose of life have be substitute in it stead the power of generalize idea of draw comprehensive conclusion from individual observation be the only acquirement for an immortal be that really deserve the name of knowledge merely to observe without endeavour to account for any thing may in a very incomplete manner serve a the common sense of life but where be the store lay up that be to clothe the soul when it leave the body this power have not only be deny to woman but writer have insist that it be inconsistent with a few exception with their sexual character let men prove this and i shall grant that woman only exist for man i must however previously remark that the power of generalize idea to any great extent be not very common amongst men or woman but this exercise be the true cultivation of the understanding and every thing conspire to render the cultivation of the understand more difficult in the female than the male world i be naturally lead by this assertion to the main subject of the present chapter and shall now attempt to point out some of the cause that degrade the sex and prevent woman from generalize their observation i shall not go back to the remote annals of antiquity to trace the history of woman it be sufficient to allow that she have always be either a slave or a despot and to remark that each of these situation equally retard the progress of reason the grand source of female folly and vice have ever appear to me to arise from narrowness of mind and the very constitution of civil government have put almost insuperable obstacle in the way to prevent the cultivation of the female understanding yet virtue can be build on no other foundation the same obstacle be throw in the way of the rich and the same consequence ensue necessity have be proverbially term the mother of invention the aphorism may be extend to virtue it be an acquirement and an acquirement to which pleasure must be sacrifice and who sacrifice pleasure when it be within the grasp whose mind have not be open and strengthen by adversity or the pursuit of knowledge goad on by necessity happy be it when people have the care of life to struggle with for these struggle prevent their become a prey to enervate vice merely from idleness but if from their birth men and woman be place in a torrid zone with the meridian sun of pleasure dart directly upon them how can theysufficiently brace their mind to discharge the duty of life or even to relish the affection that carry them out of themselves pleasure be the business of a womans life accord to the present modification of society and while it continue to be so little can be expect from such weak being inherit in a lineal descent from the first fair defect in nature the sovereignty of beauty theyhave to maintain their power resign their natural right which the exercise of reason might have procure them and choose rather to be shortlived queen than labour to attain the sober pleasures that arise from equality exalt by their inferiority this sound like a contradiction theyconstantly demand homage a woman though experience should teach them that the men who pride themselves upon pay this arbitrary insolent respect to the sex with the most scrupulous exactness be most inclined to tyrannize over and despise the very weakness theycherish often do theyrepeat mr hume sentiment when compare the french and athenian character he allude to woman but what be more singular in this whimsical nation say i to the athenian be that a frolic of yours during the saturnalia when the slave be serve by their master be seriously continue by them through the whole year and through the whole course of their life accompany too with some circumstance which still far augment the absurdity and ridicule your sport only elevate for a few day those whom fortune have throw down and whom she too in sport may really elevate forever above you but this nation gravely exalt those whom nature have subject to them and whose inferiority and infirmity be absolutely incurable the woman though without virtue be their master and sovereign ah why do woman i write with affectionate solicitude condescend to receive a degree of attention and respect from stranger different from that reciprocation of civility which the dictate of humanity and the politeness of civilization authorise between man and man and why do theynot discover when in the noon of beautys power that theybe treat like queen only to be delude by hollow respect till theybe lead to resign or not assume their natural prerogative confine then in cage like the feather race theyhave nothing to do but to plume themselves and stalk with mockmajesty from perch to perch it be true theybe provide with food and raiment for which theyneither toil nor spin but health liberty and virtue be give in exchange but where amongst mankind have be find sufficient strength of mind to enable a be to resign these adventitious prerogative one who rise with the calm dignity of reason above opinion dare to be proud of the privilege inherent in man and it be vain to expect it whilst hereditary power choke the affection and nip reason in the bud the passion of men have thus place woman on throne and till mankind become more reasonable it be to be fear that woman will avail themselves of the power which theyattain with the least exertion and which be the most indisputable theywill smile yes theywill smile though told that in beauty empire be no mean and woman either slave or queen be quickly scornd when not adord but the adoration come first and the scorn be not anticipate lewis the xivth in particular spread factitious manner and caught in a specious way the whole nation in hi toil for establish an artful chain of despotism he make it the interest of the people at large individually to respect hi station and support hi power and woman whom he flatter by a puerile attention to the whole sex obtain in hi reign that princelike distinction so fatal to reason and virtue a king be always a king and a woman always a woman and a wit always a wit might be add for the vain foolery of wit and beauty to obtain attention and make conquest be much upon a par hi authority and her sex ever stand between them and rational converse with a lover i grant she should be so and her sensibility will naturally lead her to endeavour to excite emotion not to gratify her vanity but her heart this i do not allow to be coquetry it be the artless impulse of nature i only exclaim against the sexual desire of conquest when the heart be out of the question this desire be not confine to woman i have endeavour say lord chesterfield to gain the heart of twenty woman whose person i would not have give a fig for the libertine who in a gust of passion take advantage of unsuspecting tenderness be a saint when compare with this coldhearted rascal for i like to use significant word yet only teach to please woman be always on the watch to please and with true heroic ardour endeavour to gain heart merely to resign or spurn them when the victory be decide and conspicuous i must descend to the minutia of the subject i lament that woman be systematically degrade by receive the trivial attention which men think it manly to pay to the sex when in fact theybe insultingly support their own superiority it be not condescension to bow to an inferior so ludicrous in fact do these ceremony appear to me that i scarcely be able to govern my muscle when i see a man start with eager and serious solicitude to lift a handkerchief or shut a door when the lady could have do it herself have she only move a pace or two a wild wish have just fly from my heart to my head and i will not stifle it though it may excite a horse laugh i do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confound in society unless where love animate the behaviour for this distinction be i be firmly persuade the foundation of the weakness of character ascribe to woman be the cause why the understanding be neglect whilst accomplishment be acquire with sedulous care and the same cause account for their prefer the graceful before the heroic virtue mankind include every description wish to be love and respect for something and the common herd will always take the near road to the completion of their wish the respect pay to wealth and beauty be the most certain and unequivocal and of course will always attract the vulgar eye of common mind ability and virtue be absolutely necessary to raise men from the middle rank of life into notice and the natural consequence be notorious the middle rank contain most virtue and ability men have thus in one station at least an opportunity of exert themselves with dignity and of rise by the exertion which really improve a rational creature but the whole female sex be till their character be form in the same condition a the rich for theybe bear i now speak of a state of civilization with certain sexual privilege and whilst theybe gratuitously grant them few will ever think of work of supererogation to obtain the esteem of a small number of superior people when do we hear of woman who start out of obscurity boldly claim respect on account of their great ability or dare virtue where be theyto be find to be observe to be attend to to be take notice of with sympathy complacency and approbation be all the advantage which theyseek true my male reader will probably exclaim but let them before theydraw any conclusion recollect that this be not write originally a descriptive of woman but of the rich in dr smith theory of moral sentiment i have find a general character of people of rank and fortune that in my opinion might with the great propriety be apply to the female sex i refer the sagacious reader to the whole comparison but must be allow to quote a passage to enforce an argument that i mean to insist on a the one most conclusive against a sexual character for if excepting warrior no great men of any denomination have ever appear amongst the nobility may it not be fairly infer that their local situation swallow up the man and produce a character similar to that of woman who be localized if i may be allow the word by the rank theybe place in by courtesy woman commonly call lady be not to be contradict in company be not allow to exert any manual strength and from them the negative virtue only be expect when any virtue be expect patience docility goodhumour and flexibility virtue incompatible with any vigorous exertion of intellect besides by live more with each other and to be seldom absolutely alone theybe more under the influence of sentiment than passion solitude and reflection be necessary to give to wish the force of passion and enable the imagination to enlarge the object and make it the most desirable the same may be say of the rich theydo not sufficiently deal in general idea collect by impassionate thinking or calm investigation to acquire that strength of character on which great resolve be build but hear what an acute observer say of the great do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which theymay acquire the public admiration or do theyseem to imagine that to them a to other men it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood by what important accomplishment be the young nobleman instruct to support the dignity of hi rank and to render himself worthy of that superiority over hi fellow citizen to which the virtue of hi ancestor have raise them be it by knowledge by industry by patience by selfdenial or by virtue of any kind a all hi word a all hi motion be attend to he learn an habitual regard for every circumstance of ordinary behaviour and study to perform all those small duty with the most exact propriety a he be conscious how much he be observe and how much mankind be dispose to favour all hi inclination he act upon the most indifferent occasion with that freedom and elevation which the thought of this naturally inspire hi air hi manner hi deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense of hi own superiority which those who be bear to an inferior station can hardly ever arrive at these be the art by which he propose to make mankind more easily submit to hi authority and to govern their inclination accord to hi own pleasure and in this he be seldom disappointed these art support by rank and preeminence be upon ordinary occasion sufficient to govern the world lewis xiv during the great part of hi reign be regard not only in france but over all europe a the most perfect model of a great prince but what be the talent and virtue by which he acquire this great reputation be it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all hi undertaking by the immense danger and difficulty with which theybe attend or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursue them be it by hi extensive knowledge by hi exquisite judgment or by hi heroic valour it be by none of these quality but he be first of all the most powerful prince in europe and consequently hold the high rank among king and then say hi historian he surpass all hi courtier in the gracefulness of hi shape and the majestic beauty of hi feature the sound of hi voice noble and affect gain those heart which hi presence intimidate he have a step and a deportment which could suit only him and hi rank and which would have be ridiculous in any other person the embarrassment which he occasion to those who speak to him flatter that secret satisfaction with which he felt hi own superiority these frivolous accomplishment support by hi rank and no doubt too by a degree of other talent and virtue which seem however not to have be much above mediocrity establish this prince in the esteem of hi own age and have draw even from posterity a good deal of respect for hi memory compared with these in hi own time and in hi own presence no other virtue it seem appear to have any merit knowledge industry valour and beneficence trembling be abash and lose all dignity before them woman also thus in herself complete by possess all these frivolous accomplishment so change the nature of thing that what she will to do or say seems wise virtuousest discreet best all high knowledge in her presence fall degraded wisdom in discourse with her loses discountenancd and like folly show authority and reason on her wait and all this be build on her loveliness in the middle rank of life to continue the comparison men in their youth be prepare for profession and marriage be not consider a the grand feature in their life whilst woman on the contrary have no other scheme to sharpen their faculty it be not business extensive plan or any of the excursive flight of ambition that engross their attention no their thought be not employ in rear such noble structure to rise in the world and have the liberty of run from pleasure to pleasure theymust marry advantageously and to this object their time be sacrifice and their person often legally prostitute a man when he enter any profession have hi eye steadily fix on some future advantage and the mind gain great strength by have all it effort direct to one point and full of hi business pleasure be consider a mere relaxation whilst woman seek for pleasure a the main purpose of existence in fact from the education which theyreceive from society the love of pleasure may be say to govern them all but do this prove that there be a sex in soul it would be just a rational to declare that the courtier in france when a destructive system of despotism have form their character be not men because liberty virtue and humanity be sacrifice to pleasure and vanity fatal passion which have ever domineer over the whole race the same love of pleasure foster by the whole tendency of their education give a trifle turn to the conduct of woman in most circumstance for instance theybe ever anxious about secondary thing and on the watch for adventure instead of be occupy by duty a man when he undertake a journey have in general the end in view a woman think more of the incidental occurrences the strange thing that may possibly occur on the road the impression that she may make on her fellow traveller and above all she be anxiously intent on the care of the finery that she carry with her which be more than ever a part of herself when go to figure on a new scene when to use an apt french turn of expression she be go to produce a sensation can dignity of mind exist with such trivial care in short woman in general as well a the rich of both sex have acquire all the folly and vice of civilization and miss the useful fruit it be not necessary for me always to premise that i speak of the condition of the whole sex leave exception out of the question their sens be inflame and their understanding neglect consequently theybecome the prey of their sens delicately term sensibility and be blow about by every momentary gust of feeling theybe therefore in a much bad condition than theywould be in be theyin a state nearer to nature ever restless and anxious their over exercise sensibility not only render them uncomfortable themselves but troublesome to use a soft phrase to other all their thought turn on thing calculate to excite emotion and feeling when theyshould reason their conduct be unstable and their opinion be waver not the wavering produce by deliberation or progressive view but by contradictory emotion by fit and start theybe warm in many pursuit yet this warmth never concentrate into perseverance soon exhaust itself exhale by it own heat or meeting with some other fleeting passion to which reason have never give any specific gravity neutrality ensue miserable indeed must be that be whose cultivation of mind have only tend to inflame it passion a distinction should be make between inflame and strengthen them the passion thus pamper whilst the judgment be leave unformed what can be expect to ensue undoubtedly a mixture of madness and folly this observation should not be confine to the fair sex however at present i only mean to apply it to them novel music poetry and gallantry all tend to make woman the creature of sensation and their character be thus form during the time theybe acquire accomplishment the only improvement theybe excite by their station in society to acquire this overstretched sensibility naturally relax the other power of the mind and prevents intellect from attain that sovereignty which it ought to attain to render a rational creature useful to other and content with it own station for the exercise of the understanding a life advance be the only method point out by nature to calm the passion satiety have a very different effect and i have often be forcibly strike by an emphatical description of damnation when the spirit be represent a continually hover with abortive eagerness round the defile body unable to enjoy any thing without the organ of sense yet to their sens be woman make slave because it be by their sensibility that theyobtain present power and will moralist pretend to assert that this be the condition in which one half of the human race should be encourage to remain with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence kind instructor what be we create for to remain it may be say innocent theymean in a state of childhood we might as well never have be bear unless it be necessary that we should be create to enable man to acquire the noble privilege of reason the power of discern good from evil whilst we lie down in the dust from whence we be take never to rise again it would be an endless task to trace the variety of meanness care and sorrow into which woman be plunge by the prevailing opinion that theybe create rather to feel than reason and that all the power theyobtain must be obtain by their charm and weakness fine by defect and amiably weak and make by this amiable weakness entirely dependent except what theygain by illicit sway on man not only for protection but advice be it surprise that neglect the duty that reason alone point out and shrink from trial calculate to strengthen their mind theyonly exert themselves to give their defect a graceful cover which may serve to heighten their charm in the eye of the voluptuary though it sink them below the scale of moral excellence fragile in every sense of the word theybe oblige to look up to man for every comfort in the most trifling danger theycling to their support with parasitical tenacity piteously demand succour and their natural protector extend hi arm or lift up hi voice to guard the lovely tremblerfrom what perhaps the frown of an old cow or the jump of a mouse a rat would be a serious danger in the name of reason and even common sense what can save such being from contempt even though theybe soft and fair these fear when not affect may be very pretty but theyshew a degree of imbecility that degrade a rational creature in a way woman be not aware offor love and esteem be very distinct thing i be fully persuade that we should hear of none of these infantine air if girl be allow to take sufficient exercise and not confine in close room till their muscle be relax and their power of digestion destroy to carry the remark still far if fear in girl instead of be cherish perhaps create be treat in the same manner a cowardice in boy we should quickly see woman with more dignified aspect it be true theycould not then with equal propriety be term the sweet flower that smile in the walk of man but theywould be more respectable member of society and discharge the important duty of life by the light of their own reason educate woman like men say rousseau and the more theyresemble our sex the less power will theyhave over u this be the very point i aim at i do not wish them to have power over men but over themselves in the same strain have i hear men argue against instruct the poor for many be the form that aristocracy assume teach them to read and write say theyand you take them out of the station assign them by nature an eloquent frenchman have answer them i will borrow hi sentiment but theyknow not when theymake man a brute that theymay expect every instant to see him transform into a ferocious beast without knowledge there can be no morality ignorance be a frail base for virtue yet that it be the condition for which woman be organize have be insist upon by the writer who have most vehemently argue in favour of the superiority of man a superiority not in degree but essence though to soften the argument theyhave labour to prove with chivalrous generosity that the sex ought not to be compare man be make to reason woman to feel and that together flesh and spirit theymake the most perfect whole by blend happily reason and sensibility into one character and what be sensibility quickness of sensation quickness of perception delicacy thus be it define by dr johnson and the definition give me no other idea than of the most exquisitely polished instinct i discern not a trace of the image of god in either sensation or matter refine seventy time seven theybe still material intellect dwell not there nor will fire ever make lead gold i come round to my old argument if woman be allow to have an immortal soul she must have a the employment of life an understanding to improve and when to render the present state more complete though every thing prove it to be but a fraction of a mighty sum she be incite by present gratification to forget her grand destination nature be counteract or she be bear only to procreate and rot or grant brute of every description a soul though not a reasonable one the exercise of instinct and sensibility may be the step which theybe to take in this life towards the attainment of reason in the next so that through all eternity theywill lag behind man who why we can not tell have the power give him of attain reason in hi first mode of existence when i treat of the peculiar duty of woman a i should treat of the peculiar duty of a citizen or father it will be find that i do not mean to insinuate that theyshould be take out of their family speaking of the majority he that hath wife and child say lord bacon hath give hostage to fortune for theybe impediment to great enterprise either of virtue or mischief certainly the best work and of great merit for the public have proceed from the unmarried or childless men i say the same of woman but the welfare of society be not build on extraordinary exertion and be it more reasonably organize there would be still less need of great ability or heroic virtue in the regulation of a family in the education of child understand in an unsophisticated sense be particularly required strength both of body and mind yet the men who by their writing have most earnestly labour to domesticate woman have endeavour by argument dictate by a gross appetite that satiety have render fastidious to weaken their body and cramp their mind but if even by these sinister method theyreally persuaded woman by work on their feeling to stay at home and fulfil the duty of a mother and mistress of a family i should cautiously oppose opinion that lead woman to right conduct by prevail on them to make the discharge of a duty the business of life though reason be insult yet and i appeal to experience if by neglect the understanding theybe as much nay more attached from these domestic duty than theycould be by the most serious intellectual pursuit though it may be observe that the mass of mankind will never vigorously pursue an intellectual object i may be allow to infer that reason be absolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty properly and i must again repeat that sensibility be not reason the comparison with the rich still occur to me for when men neglect the duty of humanity woman will do the same a common stream hurry them both along with thoughtless celerity rich and honour prevent a man from enlarge hi understanding and enervate all hi power by reverse the order of nature which have ever make true pleasure the reward of labour pleasureenervating pleasure be likewise within woman reach without earn it but till hereditary possession be spread abroad how can we expect men to be proud of virtue and till theybe woman will govern them by the most direct mean neglect their dull domestic duty to catch the pleasure that be on the wing of time the power of woman say some author be her sensibility and men not aware of the consequence do all theycan to make this power swallow up every other those who constantly employ their sensibility will have most for example poet painter and composer yet when the sensibility be thus increase at the expense of reason and even the imagination why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness the sexual attention of man particularly act on female sensibility and this sympathy have be exercise from their youth up a husband can not long pay those attention with the passion necessary to excite lively emotion and the heart accustom to lively emotion turn to a new lover or pine in secret the prey of virtue or prudence i mean when the heart have really be render susceptible and the taste form for i be apt to conclude from what i have see in fashionable life that vanity be oftener foster than sensibility by the mode of education and the intercourse between the sex which i have reprobate and that coquetry more frequently proceeds from vanity than from that inconstancy which overstrain sensibility naturally produce another argument that have have a great weight with me must i think have some force with every considerate benevolent heart girl who have be thus weakly educate be often cruelly leave by their parent without any provision and of course be dependent on not only the reason but the bounty of their brother these brother be to view the fair side of the question good sort of men and give a a favour what child of the same parent have an equal right to in this equivocal humiliating situation a docile female may remain some time with a tolerable degree of comfort but when the brother marry a probable circumstance from be consider a the mistress of the family she be view with averted look a an intruder an unnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house and hi new partner who can recount the misery which many unfortunate being whose mind and body be equally weak suffer in such situationsunable to work and ashamed to beg the wife a coldhearted narrowminded woman and this be not an unfair supposition for the present mode of education do not tend to enlarge the heart any more than the understanding be jealous of the little kindness which her husband show to hi relation and her sensibility not rise to humanity she be displease at see the property of her child lavish on an helpless sister these be matter of fact which have come under my eye again and again the consequence be obvious the wife have recourse to cunning to undermine the habitual affection which she be afraid openly to oppose and neither tear nor caress be spar till the spy be work out of her home and throw on the world unprepared for it difficulty or send a a great effort of generosity or from some regard to propriety with a small stipend and an uncultivated mind into joyless solitude these two woman may be much upon a par with respect to reason and humanity and change situation might have act just the same selfish part but have theybe differently educate the case would also have be very different the wife would not have have that sensibility of which self be the centre and reason might have teach her not to expect and not even to be flatter by the affection of her husband if it lead him to violate prior duty she would wish not to love him merely because he love her but on account of hi virtue and the sister might have be able to struggle for herself instead of eat the bitter bread of dependence i be indeed persuade that the heart as well a the understanding be open by cultivation and by which may not appear so clear strengthen the organ i be not now talk of momentary flash of sensibility but of affection and perhaps in the education of both sex the most difficult task be so to adjust instruction a not to narrow the understanding whilst the heart be warm by the generous juice of spring just raise by the electric fermentation of the season nor to dry up the feeling by employ the mind in investigation remote from life with respect to woman when theyreceive a careful education theybe either make fine lady brimful of sensibility and teem with capricious fancy or mere notable woman the latter be often friendly honest creature and have a shrewd kind of good sense join with worldly prudence that often render them more useful member of society than the fine sentimental lady though theypossess neither greatness of mind nor taste the intellectual world be shut against them take them out of their family or neighbourhood and theystand still the mind find no employment for literature affords a fund of amusement which theyhave never seek to relish but frequently to despise the sentiment and taste of more cultivated mind appear ridiculous even in those whom chance and family connexion have lead them to love but in mere acquaintance theythink it all affectation a man of sense can only love such a woman on account of her sex and respect her because she be a trusty servant he let her to preserve hi own peace scold the servant and go to church in clothes make of the very best material a man of her own size of understand would probably not agree so well with her for he might wish to encroach on her prerogative and manage some domestic concern himself yet woman whose mind be not enlarge by cultivation or the natural selfishness of sensibility expand by reflection be very unfit to manage a family for by an undue stretch of power theybe always tyrannize to support a superiority that only rest on the arbitrary distinction of fortune the evil be sometimes more serious and domestic be deprive of innocent indulgence and make to work beyond their strength in order to enable the notable woman to keep a well table and outshine her neighbour in finery and parade if she attend to her child it be in general to dress them in a costly mannerand whether this attention arise from vanity or fondness it be equally pernicious besides how many woman of this description pass their day or at least their evening discontentedly their husband acknowledge that theybe good manager and chaste wife but leave home to seek for more agreeable may i be allow to use a significant french word piquant society and the patient drudge who fulfil her task like a blind horse in a mill be defraud of her just reward for the wage due to her be the caress of her husband and woman who have so few resource in themselves do not very patiently bear this privation of a natural right a fine lady on the contrary have be teach to look down with contempt on the vulgar employment of life though she have only be incite to acquire accomplishment that rise a degree above sense for even corporeal accomplishment can not be acquire with any degree of precision unless the understanding have be strengthen by exercise without a foundation of principle taste be superficial and grace must arise from something deep than imitation the imagination however be heat and the feeling render fastidious if not sophisticated or a counterpoise of judgment be not acquire when the heart still remain artless though it become too tender these woman be often amiable and their heart be really more sensible to general benevolence more alive to the sentiment that civilize life than the square elbow family drudge but want a due proportion of reflection and selfgovernment theyonly inspire love and be the mistress of their husband whilst theyhave any hold on their affection and the platonic friend of hi male acquaintance these be the fair defect in nature the woman who appear to be create not to enjoy the fellowship of man but to save him from sink into absolute brutality by rub off the rough angle of hi character and by playful dalliance to give some dignity to the appetite that draw him to them gracious creator of the whole human race hast thou create such a be a woman who can trace thy wisdom in thy work and feel that thou alone art by thy nature exalt above herfor no good purpose can she believe that she be only make to submit to man her equal a be who like her be send into the world to acquire virtue can she consent to be occupy merely to please him merely to adorn the earth when her soul be capable of rise to thee and can she rest supinely dependent on man for reason when she ought to mount with him the arduous steep of knowledge yet if love be the supreme good let woman be only educate to inspire it and let every charm be polish to intoxicate the sens but if theybe moral being let them have a chance to become intelligent and let love to man be only a part of that glow flame of universal love which after encircle humanity mount in grateful incense to god to fulfil domestic duty much resolution be necessary and a serious kind of perseverance that require a more firm support than emotion however lively and true to nature to give an example of order the soul of virtue some austerity of behaviour must be adopt scarcely to be expect from a be who from it infancy have be make the weathercock of it own sensation whoever rationally mean to be useful must have a plan of conduct and in the discharge of the simple duty we be often oblige to act contrary to the present impulse of tenderness or compassion severity be frequently the most certain as well a the most sublime proof of affection and the want of this power over the feeling and of that lofty dignify affection which make a person prefer the future good of the beloved object to a present gratification be the reason why so many fond mother spoil their child and have make it questionable whether negligence or indulgence be most hurtful but i be inclined to think that the latter have do most harm mankind seem to agree that child should be leave under the management of woman during their childhood now from all the observation that i have be able to make woman of sensibility be the most unfit for this task because theywill infallibly carry away by their feeling spoil a child temper the management of the temper the first and most important branch of education require the sober steady eye of reason a plan of conduct equally distant from tyranny and indulgence yet these be the extreme that people of sensibility alternately fall into always shoot beyond the mark i have follow this train of reason much far till i have conclude that a person of genius be the most improper person to be employ in education public or private mind of this rare specie see thing too much in mass and seldom if ever have a good temper that habitual cheerfulness term good humour be perhaps a seldom united with great mental power a with strong feeling and those people who follow with interest and admiration the flight of genius or with cool approbation suck in the instruction which have be elaborately prepared for them by the profound thinker ought not to be disgust if theyfind the former choleric and the latter morose because liveliness of fancy and a tenacious comprehension of mind be scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which lead a man at least to bend to the opinion and prejudice of other instead of roughly confront them but treat of education or manner mind of a superior class be not to be consider theymay be leave to chance it be the multitude with moderate ability who call for instruction and catch the colour of the atmosphere theybreathe this respectable concourse i contend men and woman should not have their sensation heighten in the hotbed of luxurious indolence at the expence of their understanding for unless there be a ballast of understand theywill never become either virtuous or free an aristocracy found on property or sterling talent will ever sweep before it the alternately timid and ferocious slave of feeling numberless be the argument to take another view of the subject bring forward with a show of reason because suppose to be deduce from nature that men have use morally and physically to degrade the sex i must notice a few the female understanding have often be speak of with contempt a arrive sooner at maturity than the male i shall not answer this argument by allude to the early proof of reason as well a genius in cowley milton and pope many other name might be add but only appeal to experience to decide whether young men who be early introduce into company and example now abound do not acquire the same precocity so notorious be this fact that the bare mentioning of it must bring before people who at all mix in the world the idea of a number of swagger ape of men whose understanding be narrow by be bring into the society of men when theyought to have be spin a top or twirl a hoop it have also be assert by some naturalist that men do not attain their full growth and strength till thirty but that woman arrive at maturity by twenty i apprehend that theyreason on false ground lead astray by the male prejudice which deem beauty the perfection of womanmere beauty of feature and complexion the vulgar acceptation of the world whilst male beauty be allow to have some connexion with the mind strength of body and that character of countenance which the french term a physionomie woman do not acquire before thirty any more than men the little artless trick of child it be true be particularly pleasing and attractive yet when the pretty freshness of youth be wear off these artless grace become studied air and disgust every person of taste in the countenance of girl we only look for vivacity and bashful modesty but the springtide of life over we look for soberer sense in the face and for trace of passion instead of the dimple of animal spirit expect to see individuality of character the only fastener of the affection we then wish to converse not to fondle to give scope to our imagination as well a to the sensation of our heart at twenty the beauty of both sex be equal but the libertinism of man lead him to make the distinction and superannuate coquette be commonly of the same opinion for when theycan no longer inspire love theypay for the vigour and vivacity of youth the french who admit more of mind into their notion of beauty give the preference to woman of thirty i mean to say that theyallow woman to be in their most perfect state when vivacity give place to reason and to that majestic seriousness of character which mark maturity or the rest point in youth till twenty the body shoot out till thirty the solid be attain a degree of density and the flexible muscle grow daily more rigid give character to the countenance that be theytrace the operation of the mind with the iron pen of fate and tell u not only what power be within but how theyhave be employ it be proper to observe that animal who arrive slowly at maturity be the long lived and of the noble specie men can not however claim any natural superiority from the grandeur of longevity for in this respect nature have not distinguish the male polygamy be another physical degradation and a plausible argument for a custom that blast every domestic virtue be draw from the wellattested fact that in the country where it be establish more female be bear than male this appear to be an indication of nature and to nature apparently reasonable speculation must yield a further conclusion obviously present itself if polygamy be necessary woman must be inferior to man and make for him with respect to the formation of the foetus in the womb we be very ignorant but it appear to me probable that an accidental physical cause may account for this phenomenon and prove it not to be a law of nature i have meet with some pertinent observation on the subject in forsters account of the isle of the south sea that will explain my meaning after observe that of the two sex amongst animal the most vigorous and hot constitution always prevail and produce it kind he addsif this be apply to the inhabitant of africa it be evident that the men there accustom to polygamy be enervate by the use of so many woman and therefore less vigorous the woman on the contrary be of a hotter constitution not only on account of their more irritable nerve more sensitive organization and more lively fancy but likewise because theybe deprive in their matrimony of that share of physical love which in a monogamous condition would all be theirs and thus for the above reason the generality of child be bear female in the great part of europe it have be prove by the most accurate list of mortality that the proportion of men to woman be nearly equal or if any difference take place the male bear be more numerous in the proportion of to the necessity of polygamy therefore do not appear yet when a man seduce a woman it should i think be term a lefthanded marriage and the man should be legally oblige to maintain the woman and her child unless adultery a natural divorcement abrogate the law and this law should remain in force as long a the weakness of woman cause the word seduction to be use a an excuse for their frailty and want of principle nay while theydepend on man for a subsistence instead of earn it by the exercise of their own hand or head but these woman should not in the full meaning of the relationship be term wife or the very purpose of marriage would be subvert and all those endear charity that flow from personal fidelity and give a sanctity to the tie when neither love nor friendship unite the heart would melt into selfishness the woman who be faithful to the father of her child demand respect and should not be treat like a prostitute though i readily grant that if it be necessary for a man and woman to live together in order to bring up their offspring nature never intend that a man should have more than one wife still highly a i respect marriage a the foundation of almost every social virtue i can not avoid feel the most lively compassion for those unfortunate female who be break off from society and by one error tear from all those affection and relationship that improve the heart and mind it do not frequently even deserve the name of error for many innocent girl become the dupe of a sincere affectionate heart and still more be a it may emphatically be term ruined before theyknow the difference between virtue and vice and thus prepare by their education for infamy theybecome infamous asylum and magdalen be not the proper remedy for these abuse it be justice not charity that be want in the world a woman who have lose her honour imago that she can not fall low and a for recover her former station it be impossible no exertion can wash this stain away losing thus every spur and have no other mean of support prostitution become her only refuge and the character be quickly deprave by circumstance over which the poor wretch have little power unless she possess an uncommon portion of sense and loftiness of spirit necessity never make prostitution the business of men life though numberless be the woman who be thus render systematically vicious this however arise in a great degree from the state of idleness in which woman be educate who be always teach to look up to man for a maintenance and to consider their person a the proper return for hi exertion to support them meretricious air and the whole science of wantonness have then a more powerful stimulus than either appetite or vanity and this remark give force to the prevailing opinion that with chastity all be lose that be respectable in woman her character depend on the observance of one virtue though the only passion foster in her heartis love nay the honour of a woman be not make even to depend on her will when richardson make clarissa tell lovelace that he have rob her of her honour he must have have strange notion of honour and virtue for miserable beyond all name of misery be the condition of a be who could be degrade without it own consent this excess of strictness i have hear vindicate a a salutary error i shall answer in the word of leibnitzerrors be often useful but it be commonly to remedy other error most of the evil of life arise from a desire of present enjoyment that outrun itself the obedience require of woman in the marriage state come under this description the mind naturally weaken by depend on authority never exert it own power and the obedient wife be thus render a weak indolent mother or supposing that this be not always the consequence a future state of existence be scarcely take into the reckoning when only negative virtue be cultivate for in treating of moral particularly when woman be allude to writer have too often consider virtue in a very limited sense and make the foundation of it solely worldly utility nay a still more fragile base have be give to this stupendous fabric and the wayward fluctuating feeling of men have be make the standard of virtue yes virtue as well a religion have be subject to the decision of taste it would almost provoke a smile of contempt if the vain absurdity of man do not strike u on all side to observe how eager men be to degrade the sex from whom theypretend to receive the chief pleasure of life and i have frequently with full conviction retort pope sarcasm on them or to speak explicitly it have appear to me applicable to the whole human race a love of pleasure or sway seem to divide mankind and the husband who lord it in hi little harem think only of hi pleasure or hi convenience to such length indeed do an intemperate love of pleasure carry some prudent men or wear out libertine who marry to have a safe companion that theyseduce their own wife hymen banishes modesty and chaste love take it flight love consider a an animal appetite can not long feed on itself without expire and this extinction in it own flame may be term the violent death of love but the wife who have thus be render licentious will probably endeavour to fill the void leave by the loss of her husband attention for she can not contentedly become merely an upper servant after have be treat like a goddess she be still handsome and instead of transfer her fondness to her child she only dream of enjoy the sunshine of life besides there be many husband so devoid of sense and parental affection that during the first effervescence of voluptuous fondness theyrefuse to let their wife suckle their child theybe only to dress and live to please them and love even innocent love soon sink into lasciviousness when the exercise of a duty be sacrifice to it indulgence personal attachment be a very happy foundation for friendship yet when even two virtuous young people marry it would perhaps be happy if some circumstance check their passion if the recollection of some prior attachment or disappointed affection make it on one side at least rather a match found on esteem in that case theywould look beyond the present moment and try to render the whole of life respectable by form a plan to regulate a friendship which only death ought to dissolve friendship be a serious affection the most sublime of all affection because it be found on principle and cement by time the very reverse may be say of love in a great degree love and friendship can not subsist in the same bosom even when inspire by different object theyweaken or destroy each other and for the same object can only be felt in succession the vain fear and fond jealousy the wind which fan the flame of love when judiciously or artfully temper be both incompatible with the tender confidence and sincere respect of friendship love such a the glow pen of genius have trace exists not on earth or only resides in those exalt fervid imagination that have sketch such dangerous picture dangerous because theynot only afford a plausible excuse to the voluptuary who disguise sheer sensuality under a sentimental veil but a theyspread affectation and take from the dignity of virtue virtue a the very word import should have an appearance of seriousness if not austerity and to endeavour to trick her out in the garb of pleasure because the epithet have be use a another name for beauty be to exalt her on a quicksand a most insidious attempt to hasten her fall by apparent respect virtue and pleasure be not in fact so nearly ally in this life a some eloquent writer have labour to prove pleasure prepare the fading wreath and mix the intoxicating cup but the fruit which virtue give be the recompence of toil and gradually see a it ripen only affords calm satisfaction nay appear to be the result of the natural tendency of thing it be scarcely observe bread the common food of life seldom thought of a a blessing support the constitution and preserve health still feast delight the heart of man though disease and even death lurk in the cup or dainty that elevate the spirit or tickle the palate the lively heated imagination in the same style draw the picture of love a it draw every other picture with those glow colour which the daring hand will steal from the rainbow that be direct by a mind condemn in a world like this to prove it noble origin by pant after unattainable perfection ever pursue what it acknowledge to be a fleeting dream an imagination of this vigorous cast can give existence to insubstantial form and stability to the shadowy revery which the mind naturally fall into when reality be find vapid it can then depict love with celestial charm and dote on the grand ideal object it can imagine a degree of mutual affection that shall refine the soul and not expire when it have serve a a scale to heavenly and like devotion make it absorb every meaner affection and desire in each other arm a in a temple with it summit lose in the cloud the world be to be shut out and every thought and wish that do not nurture pure affection and permanent virtue permanent virtue ala rousseau respectable visionary thy paradise would soon be violate by the entrance of some unexpected guest like milton it would only contain angel or men sink below the dignity of rational creature happiness be not material it can not be see or felt yet the eager pursuit of the good which every one shape to hi own fancy proclaims man the lord of this low world and to be an intelligential creature who be not to receive but acquire happiness theytherefore who complain of the delusion of passion do not recollect that theybe exclaim against a strong proof of the immortality of the soul but leave superior mind to correct themselves and pay dearly for their experience it be necessary to observe that it be not against strong persevering passion but romantic wavering feeling that i wish to guard the female heart by exercise the understanding for these paradisiacal revery be oftener the effect of idleness than of a lively fancy woman have seldom sufficient serious employment to silence their feeling a round of little care or vain pursuit fritter away all strength of mind and organs theybecome naturally only object of sense in short the whole tenor of female education the education of society tends to render the best disposed romantic and inconstant and the remainder vain and mean in the present state of society this evil can scarcely be remedied i be afraid in the slight degree should a more laudable ambition ever gain ground theymay be bring nearer to nature and reason and become more virtuous and useful a theygrow more respectable but i will venture to assert that their reason will never acquire sufficient strength to enable it to regulate their conduct whilst the make an appearance in the world be the first wish of the majority of mankind to this weak wish the natural affection and the most useful virtue be sacrifice girl marry merely to better themselves to borrow a significant vulgar phrase and have such perfect power over their heart a not to permit themselves to fall in love till a man with a superior fortune offer on this subject i mean to enlarge in a future chapter it be only necessary to drop a hint at present because woman be so often degrade by suffer the selfish prudence of age to chill the ardour of youth from the same source flow an opinion that young girl ought to dedicate great part of their time to needle work yet this employment contract their faculty more than any other that could have be choose for them by confine their thought to their person men order their clothes to be make and have do with the subject woman make their own clothes necessary or ornamental and be continually talk about them and their thought follow their hand it be not indeed the making of necessary that weaken the mind but the frippery of dress for when a woman in the low rank of life make her husband and children clothes she do her duty this be part of her business but when woman work only to dress good than theycould otherwise afford it be bad than sheer loss of time to render the poor virtuous theymust be employ and woman in the middle rank of life do theynot ape the fashion of the nobility without catch their ease might employ them whilst theythemselves manage their family instruct their child and exercise their own mind garden experimental philosophy and literature would afford them subject to think of and matter for conversation that in some degree would exercise their understanding the conversation of french woman who be not so rigidly nail to their chair to twist lappet and knot ribband be frequently superficial but i contend that it be not half so insipid a that of those english woman whose time be spend in make caps bonnet and the whole mischief of trimming not to mention shop bargainhunting etc etc and it be the decent prudent woman who be most degrade by these practice for their motive be simply vanity the wanton who exercise her taste to render her person alluring have something more in view these observation all branch out of a general one which i have before make and which can not be too often insisted upon for speaking of men woman or profession it will be find that the employment of the thought shape the character both generally and individually the thought of woman ever hover around their person and be it surprise that their person be reckon most valuable yet some degree of liberty of mind be necessary even to form the person and this may be one reason why some gentle wife have so few attraction beside that of sex add to this sedentary employment render the majority of woman sickly and false notion of female excellence make them proud of this delicacy though it be another fetter that by call the attention continually to the body cramp the activity of the mind woman of quality seldom do any of the manual part of their dress consequently only their taste be exercise and theyacquire by think less of the finery when the business of their toilet be over that ease which seldom appear in the deportment of woman who dress merely for the sake of dress in fact the observation with respect to the middle rank the one in which talent thrive best extend not to woman for those of the superior class by catch at least a smattering of literature and converse more with men on general topic acquire more knowledge than the woman who ape their fashion and fault without share their advantage with respect to virtue to use the word in a comprehensive sense i have see most in low life many poor woman maintain their child by the sweat of their brow and keep together family that the vice of the father would have scatter abroad but gentlewoman be too indolent to be actively virtuous and be soften rather than refine by civilization indeed the good sense which i have meet with among the poor woman who have have few advantage of education and yet have act heroically strongly confirm me in the opinion that trifle employment have render woman a trifler men take her i take her body say ranger body the mind be leave to rust so that while physical love enervate man a be hi favourite recreation he will endeavour to enslave woman and who can tell how many generation may be necessary to give vigour to the virtue and talent of the freed posterity of abject slave suppose that woman be voluntary slavesslavery of any kind be unfavourable to human happiness and improvementknoxs essay in trace the cause that in my opinion have degrade woman i have confine my observation to such a universally act upon the moral and manner of the whole sex and to me it appear clear that theyall spring from want of understand whether this arise from a physical or accidental weakness of faculty time alone can determine for i shall not lay any great stress upon the example of a few woman sappho eloisa mr macaulay the empress of russia madame deon etc these and many more may be reckon exception and be not all hero as well a heroine exception to general rule i wish to see woman neither heroine nor brute but reasonable creature who from have receive a masculine education have acquire courage and resolution i only contend that the men who have be place in similar situation have acquire a similar character i speak of body of men and that men of genius and talent have start out of a class in which woman have never yet be place chapter animadversion on some of the writer who have rendered woman object of pity bordering on contempt the opinion speciously support in some modern publication on the female character and education which have give the tone to most of the observation make in a more cursory manner on the sex remain now to be examine section i shall begin with rousseau and give a sketch of the character of woman in hi own word intersperse comment and reflection my comment it be true will all spring from a few simple principle and might have be deduce from what i have already say but the artificial structure have be raise with so much ingenuity that it seem necessary to attack it in a more circumstantial manner and make the application myself sophia say rousseau should be a perfect a woman a emilius be a man and to render her so it be necessary to examine the character which nature have give to the sex he then proceed to prove that woman ought to be weak and passive because she have less bodily strength than man and from hence infers that she be form to please and to be subject to him and that it be her duty to render herself agreeable to her masterthis be the grand end of her existence suppose woman to have be form only to please and be subject to man the conclusion be just she ought to sacrifice every other consideration to render herself agreeable to him and let this brutal desire of selfpreservation be the grand spring of all her action when it be prove to be the iron bed of fate to fit which her character should be stretch or contract regardless of all moral or physical distinction but if a i think may be demonstrate the purpose of even this life view the whole be subvert by practical rule build upon this ignoble base i may be allow to doubt whether woman be create for man and though the cry of irreligion or even atheism be raise against me i will simply declare that be an angel from heaven to tell me that moses beautiful poetical cosmogony and the account of the fall of man be literally true i could not believe what my reason tell me be derogatory to the character of the supreme being and have no fear of the devil before mine eye i venture to call this a suggestion of reason instead of rest my weakness on the broad shoulder of the first seducer of my frail sex it be once demonstrate continue rousseau that man and woman be not nor ought to be constitute alike in temperament and character it follow of course that theyshould not be educate in the same manner in pursue the direction of nature theyought indeed to act in concert but theyshould not be engage in the same employments the end of their pursuit should be the same but the mean theyshould take to accomplish them and of consequence their taste and inclination should be different rousseau emilius volume page girl be from their early infancy fond of dress not content with be pretty theybe desirous of be think so we see by all their little air that this thought engage their attention and theybe hardly capable of understand what be say to them before theybe to be govern by talk to them of what people will think of their behaviour the same motive however indiscreetly make use of with boy have not the same effect provide theybe let to pursue their amusement at pleasure theycare very little what people think of them time and pain be necessary to subject boy to this motive whencesoever girl derive this first lesson it be a very good one a the body be bear in a manner before the soul our first concern should be to cultivate the former this order be common to both sex but the object of that cultivation be different in the one sex it be the develop of corporeal power in the other that of personal charm not that either the quality of strength or beauty ought to be confine exclusively to one sex but only that the order of the cultivation of both be in that respect reverse woman certainly require a much strength a to enable them to move and act gracefully and men a much address a to qualify them to act with ease child of both sex have a great many amusement in common and so theyought have theynot also many such when theybe grow up each sex have also it peculiar taste to distinguish in this particular boy love sport of noise and activity to beat the drum to whip the top and to drag about their little cart girl on the other hand be fonder of thing of show and ornament such a mirror trinket and dolls the doll be the peculiar amusement of the female from whence we see their taste plainly adapt to their destination the physical part of the art of please lie in dress and this be all which child be capacitate to cultivate of that art here then we see a primary propensity firmly establish which you need only to pursue and regulate the little creature will doubtless be very desirous to know how to dress up her doll to make it sleeve knot it flounce it head dress etc she be oblige to have so much recourse to the people about her for their assistance in these article that it would be much more agreeable to her to owe them all to her own industry hence we have a good reason for the first lesson which be usually teach these young female in which we do not appear to be set them a task but oblige them by instruct them in what be immediately useful to themselves and in fact almost all of them learn with reluctance to read and write but very readily apply themselves to the use of their needle theyimagine themselves already grow up and think with pleasure that such qualification will enable them to decorate themselves this be certainly only an education of the body but rousseau be not the only man who have indirectly say that merely the person of a young woman without any mind unless animal spirit come under that description be very please to render it weak and what some may call beautiful the understanding be neglect and girl force to sit still play with doll and listen to foolish conversation the effect of habit be insist upon a an undoubted indication of nature i know it be rousseau opinion that the first year of youth should be employ to form the body though in educate emilius he deviate from this plan yet the difference between strengthen the body on which strength of mind in a great measure depend and only give it an easy motion be very wide rousseau observation it be proper to remark be make in a country where the art of pleasing be refine only to extract the grossness of vice he do not go back to nature or hi ruling appetite disturb the operation of reason els he would not have draw these crude inference in france boy and girl particularly the latter be only educate to please to manage their person and regulate their exterior behaviour and their mind be corrupt at a very early age by the worldly and pious caution theyreceive to guard them against immodesty i speak of past time the very confession which mere child be oblige to make and the question ask by the holy men i assert these fact on good authority be sufficient to impress a sexual character and the education of society be a school of coquetry and art at the age of ten or eleven nay often much sooner girl begin to coquet and talk unreproved of establish themselves in the world by marriage in short theybe make woman almost from their very birth and compliment be listen to instead of instruction these weaken the mind nature be suppose to have act like a stepmother when she form this afterthought of creation not allow them understand however it be but consistent to subject them to authority independent of reason and to prepare them for this subjection he give the following advice girl ought to be active and diligent nor be that all theyshould also be early subject to restraint this misfortune if it really be one be inseparable from their sex nor do theyever throw it off but to suffer more cruel evil theymust be subject all their life to the most constant and severe restraint which be that of decorum it be therefore necessary to accustom them early to such confinement that it may not afterward cost them too dear and to the suppression of their caprice that theymay the more readily submit to the will of other if indeed theybe fond of be always at work theyshould be sometimes compel to lay it aside dissipation levity and inconstancy be fault that readily spring up from their first propensity when corrupt or pervert by too much indulgence to prevent this abuse we should learn them above all thing to lay a due restraint on themselves the life of a modest woman be reduce by our absurd institution to a perpetual conflict with herself not but it be just that this sex should partake of the suffering which arise from those evil it hath cause u and why be the life of a modest woman a perpetual conflict i should answer that this very system of education make it so modesty temperance and selfdenial be the sober offspring of reason but when sensibility be nurture at the expense of the understanding such weak being must be restrain by arbitrary mean and be subject to continual conflict but give their activity of mind a wider range and nobler passion and motif will govern their appetite and sentiments the common attachment and regard of a mother nay mere habit will make her beloved by her child if she do nothing to incur their hate even the restraint she lay them under if well direct will increase their affection instead of lessen it because a state of dependence be natural to the sex theyperceive themselves form for obedience this be beg the question for servitude not only debase the individual but it effect seem to be transmit to posterity consider the length of time that woman have be dependent be it surprise that some of them hug their chain and fawn like the spaniel these dog observe a naturalist at first keep their ear erect but custom have supersede nature and a token of fear be become a beauty for the same reason add rousseau woman have or ought to have but little liberty theybe apt to indulge themselves excessively in what be allow them addict in every thing to extreme theybe even more transport at their diversion than boys the answer to this be very simple slave and mob have always indulge themselves in the same excess when once theybreak loose from authority the bent bow recoil with violence when the hand be suddenly relaxed that forcibly hold it and sensibility the plaything of outward circumstance must be subject to authority or moderate by reason there result he continue from this habitual restraint a tractableness which the woman have occasion for during their whole life a theyconstantly remain either under subjection to the men or to the opinion of mankind and be never permit to set themselves above those opinion the first and most important qualification in a woman be goodnature or sweetness of temper form to obey a be so imperfect a man often full of vice and always full of fault she ought to learn betimes even to suffer injustice and to bear the insult of a husband without complaint it be not for hi sake but her own that she should be of a mild disposition the perverseness and illnature of the woman only serve to aggravate their own misfortune and the misconduct of their husband theymight plainly perceive that such be not the arm by which theygain the superiority formed to live with such an imperfect be a man theyought to learn from the exercise of their faculty the necessity of forbearance but all the sacred right of humanity be violate by insist on blind obedience or the most sacred right belong only to man the be who patiently endure injustice and silently bear insult will soon become unjust or unable to discern right from wrong besides i deny the fact this be not the true way to form or meliorate the temper for a a sex men have good temper than woman because theybe occupy by pursuit that interest the head as well a the heart and the steadiness of the head give a healthy temperature to the heart people of sensibility have seldom good temper the formation of the temper be the cool work of reason when a life advance she mix with happy art jar element i never know a weak or ignorant person who have a good temper though that constitutional good humour and that docility which fear stamp on the behaviour often obtain the name i say behaviour for genuine meekness never reach the heart or mind unless a the effect of reflection and that simple restraint produce a number of peccant humour in domestic life many sensible men will allow who find some of these gentle irritable creature very troublesome companion each sex he further argues should preserve it peculiar tone and manner a meek husband may make a wife impertinent but mildness of disposition on the woman side will always bring a man back to reason at least if he be not absolutely a brute and will sooner or later triumph over him true the mildness of reason but abject fear always inspire contempt and tear be only eloquent when theyflow down fair cheek of what material can that heart be compose which can melt when insult and instead of revolt at injustice kiss the rod be it unfair to infer that her virtue be build on narrow view and selfishness who can caress a man with true feminine softness the very moment when he treat her tyrannically nature never dictate such insincerity and though prudence of this sort be term a virtue morality become vague when any part be suppose to rest on falsehood these be mere expedient and expedient be only useful for the moment let the husband beware of trust too implicitly to this servile obedience for if hi wife can with win sweetness caress him when angry and when she ought to be angry unless contempt have stifle a natural effervescence she may do the same after part with a lover these be all preparation for adultery or should the fear of the world or of hell restrain her desire of please other men when she can no longer please her husband what substitute can be find by a be who be only form by nature and art to please man what can make her amends for this privation or where be she to seek for a fresh employment where find sufficient strength of mind to determine to begin the search when her habit be fix and vanity have long rule her chaotic mind but this partial moralist recommend cunning systematically and plausibly daughter should be always submissive their mother however should not be inexorable to make a young person tractable she ought not to be make unhappy to make her modest she ought not to be render stupid on the contrary i should not be displease at her be permit to use some art not to elude punishment in case of disobedience but to exempt herself from the necessity of obey it be not necessary to make her dependence burdensome but only to let her feel it subtilty be a talent natural to the sex and a i be persuade all our natural inclination be right and good in themselves i be of opinion this should be cultivate as well a the other it be requisite for u only to prevent it abuse whatever be be right he then proceed triumphantly to infer granted yet perhaps no aphorism ever contain a more paradoxical assertion it be a solemn truth with respect to god he reverentially i speak see the whole at once and saw it just proportion in the womb of time but man who can only inspect disjointed part find many thing wrong and it be a part of the system and therefore right that he should endeavour to alter what appear to him to be so even while he bow to the wisdom of hi creator and respect the darkness he labour to disperse the inference that follow be just suppose the principle to be sound the superiority of address peculiar to the female sex be a very equitable indemnification for their inferiority in point of strength without this woman would not be the companion of man but hi slave it be by her superiour art and ingenuity that she preserve her equality and govern him while she affect to obey woman have every thing against her as well our fault a her own timidity and weakness she have nothing in her favour but her subtilty and her beauty be it not very reasonable therefore she should cultivate both greatness of mind can never dwell with cunning or address for i shall not boggle about word when their direct signification be insincerity and falsehood but content myself with observe that if any class of mankind be so create that it must necessarily be educate by rule not strictly deducible from truth virtue be an affair of convention how could rousseau dare to assert after give this advice that in the grand end of existence the object of both sex should be the same when he well know that the mind form by it pursuit be expand by great view swallow up little one or that it become itself little men have superiour strength of body but be it not for mistaken notion of beauty woman would acquire sufficient to enable them to earn their own subsistence the true definition of independence and to bear those bodily inconvenience and exertion that be requisite to strengthen the mind let u then by be allow to take the same exercise a boy not only during infancy but youth arrive at perfection of body that we may know how far the natural superiority of man extend for what reason or virtue can be expect from a creature when the seedtime of life be neglect nonedid not the wind of heaven casually scatter many useful seed in the fallow ground beauty can not be acquire by dress and coquetry be an art not so early and speedily attain while girl be yet young however theybe in a capacity to study agreeable gesture a please modulation of voice an easy carriage and behaviour as well a to take the advantage of gracefully adapt their look and attitude to time place and occasion their application therefore should not be solely confine to the art of industry and the needle when theycome to display other talent whose utility be already apparent for my part i would have a young englishwoman cultivate her agreeable talent in order to please her future husband with as much care and assiduity a a young circassian cultivate hers to fit her for the haram of an eastern bashaw to render woman completely insignificant he addsthe tongue of woman be very voluble theyspeak early more readily and more agreeably than the men theybe accuse also of speak much more but so it ought to be and i should be very ready to convert this reproach into a compliment their lip and eye have the same activity and for the same reason a man speaks of what he know a woman of what please her the one require knowledge the other taste the principal object of a man discourse should be what be useful that of a woman what be agreeable there ought to be nothing in common between their different conversation but truth we ought not therefore to restrain the prattle of girl in the same manner a we should that of boy with that severe question to what purpose be you talk but by another which be no less difficult to answer how will your discourse be receive in infancy while theybe a yet incapable to discern good from evil theyought to observe it a a law never to say any thing disagreeable to those whom theybe speak to what will render the practice of this rule also the more difficult be that it must ever be subordinate to the former of never speak falsely or tell an untruth to govern the tongue in this manner must require great address indeed and it be too much practise both by men and woman out of the abundance of the heart how few speak so few that i who love simplicity would gladly give up politeness for a quarter of the virtue that have be sacrifice to an equivocal quality which at best should only be the polish of virtue but to complete the sketch it be easy to be conceive that if male child be not in a capacity to form any true notion of religion those idea must be greatly above the conception of the female it be for this very reason i would begin to speak to them the early on this subject for if we be to wait till theybe in a capacity to discuss methodically such profound question we should run a risk of never speak to them on this subject as long a theylive reason in woman be a practical reason capacitate them artfully to discover the mean of attain a known end but which would never enable them to discover that end itself the social relation of the sex be indeed truly admirable from their union there result a moral person of which woman may be term the eye and man the hand with this dependence on each other that it be from the man that the woman be to learn what she be to see and it be of the woman that man be to learn what he ought to do if woman could recur to the first principle of thing as well a man and man be capacitate to enter into their minutae as well a woman always independent of each other theywould live in perpetual discord and their union could not subsist but in the present harmony which naturally subsist between them their different faculty tend to one common end it be difficult to say which of them conduce the most to it each follow the impulse of the other each be obedient and both be master a the conduct of a woman be subservient to the public opinion her faith in matter of religion should for that very reason be subject to authority every daughter ought to be of the same religion a her mother and every wife to be of the same religion a her husband for though such religion should be false that docility which induce the mother and daughter to submit to the order of nature take away in the sight of god the criminality of their error a theybe not in a capacity to judge for themselves theyought to abide by the decision of their father and husband as confidently a by that of the church a authority ought to regulate the religion of the woman it be not so needful to explain to them the reason for their belief a to lay down precisely the tenet theybe to believe for the creed which present only obscure idea to the mind be the source of fanaticism and that which present absurdity lead to infidelity absolute uncontroverted authority it seem must subsist somewhere but be not this a direct and exclusive appropriation of reason the right of humanity have be thus confine to the male line from adam downwards rousseau would carry hi male aristocracy still far for he insinuate that he should not blame those who contend for leave woman in a state of the most profound ignorance if it be not necessary in order to preserve her chastity and justify the man choice in the eye of the world to give her a little knowledge of men and the custom produce by human passion els she might propagate at home without be render less voluptuous and innocent by the exercise of her understanding excepting indeed during the first year of marriage when she might employ it to dress like sophia her dress be extremely modest in appearance and yet very coquettish in fact she do not make a display of her charm she conceal them but in conceal them she know how to affect your imagination every one who see her will say there be a modest and discreet girl but while you be near her your eye and affection wander all over her person so that you can not withdraw them and you would conclude that every part of her dress simple a it seem be only put in it proper order to be take to piece by the imagination be this modesty be this a preparation for immortality again what opinion be we to form of a system of education when the author say of hi heroine that with her do thing well be but a secondary concern her principal concern be to do them neatly secondary in fact be all her virtue and quality for respect religion he make her parent thus address her accustomed to submissionyour husband will instruct you in good time after thus cramp a woman mind if in order to keep it fair he have not make it quite a blank he advise her to reflect that a reflect man may not yawn in her company when he be tire of caress her what have she to reflect about who must obey and would it not be a refinement on cruelty only to open her mind to make the darkness and misery of her fate visible yet these be hi sensible remark how consistent with what i have already be oblige to quote to give a fair view of the subject the reader may determine theywho pass their whole life in work for their daily bread have no idea beyond their business or their interest and all their understanding seem to lie in their finger end this ignorance be neither prejudicial to their integrity nor their moral it be often of service to them sometimes by mean of reflection we be lead to compound with our duty and we conclude by substitute a jargon of word in the room of thing our own conscience be the most enlightened philosopher there be no need of be acquaint with tully office to make a man of probity and perhaps the most virtuous woman in the world be the least acquainted with the definition of virtue but it be no less true than an improved understanding only can render society agreeable and it be a melancholy thing for a father of a family who be fond of home to be oblige to be always wrap up in himself and to have nobody about him to whom he can impart hi sentiment besides how should a woman void of reflection be capable of educate her child how should she discern what be proper for them how should she incline them to those virtue she be unacquainted with or to that merit of which she have no idea she can only sooth or chide them render them insolent or timid she will make them formal coxcomb or ignorant blockhead but will never make them sensible or amiable how indeed should she when her husband be not always at hand to lend her hi reason when theyboth together make but one moral be a blind will eye without hand would go a very little way and perchance hi abstract reason that should concentrate the scattered beam of her practical reason may be employ in judging of the flavour of wine discant on the sauce most proper for turtle or more profoundly intent at a cardtable he may be generalize hi idea a he bet away hi fortune leave all the minutia of education to hi helpmate or chance but grant that woman ought to be beautiful innocent and silly to render her a more alluring and indulgent companionwhat be her understanding sacrifice for and why be all this preparation necessary only accord to rousseau own account to make her the mistress of her husband a very short time for no man ever insist more on the transient nature of love thus speak the philosopher sensual pleasure be transient the habitual state of the affection always loses by their gratification the imagination which deck the object of our desire be lose in fruition except the supreme being who be selfexistent there be nothing beautiful but what be ideal but he return to hi unintelligible paradox again when he thus address sophia emilius in become your husband be become your master and claim your obedience such be the order of nature when a man be married however to such a wife a sophia it be proper he should be direct by her this be also agreeable to the order of nature it be therefore to give you a much authority over hi heart a hi sex give him over your person that i have make you the arbiter of hi pleasure it may cost you perhaps some disagreeable selfdenial but you will be certain of maintain your empire over him if you can preserve it over yourself what i have already observe also show me that this difficult attempt do not surpass your courage would you have your husband constantly at your foot keep him at some distance from your person you will long maintain the authority of love if you know but how to render your favour rare and valuable it be thus you may employ even the art of coquetry in the service of virtue and those of love in that of reason i shall close my extract with a just description of a comfortable couple and yet you must not imagine that even such management will always suffice whatever precaution be take enjoyment will by degree take off the edge of passion but when love hath last as long a possible a pleasing habitude supply it place and the attachment of a mutual confidence succeed to the transport of passion child often form a more agreeable and permanent connexion between married people than even love itself when you cease to be the mistress of emilius you will continue to be hi wife and friend you will be the mother of hi child rousseau emilius child he truly observe form a much more permanent connexion between married people than love beauty he declare will not be value or even see after a couple have live six month together artificial grace and coquetry will likewise pall on the sens why then do he say that a girl should be educate for her husband with the same care a for an eastern haram i now appeal from the revery of fancy and refined licentiousness to the good sense of mankind whether if the object of education be to prepare woman to become chaste wife and sensible mother the method so plausibly recommend in the foregoing sketch be the one best calculate to produce those end will it be allow that the sure way to make a wife chaste be to teach her to practise the wanton art of a mistress term virtuous coquetry by the sensualist who can no longer relish the artless charm of sincerity or taste the pleasure arise from a tender intimacy when confidence be unchecked by suspicion and render interesting by sense the man who can be content to live with a pretty useful companion without a mind have lose in voluptuous gratification a taste for more refined enjoyment he have never felt the calm satisfaction that refresh the parched heart like the silent dew of heavenof be beloved by one who could understand him in the society of hi wife he be still alone unless when the man be sink in the brute the charm of life say a grave philosophical reasoner be sympathy nothing please u more than to observe in other men a fellowfeeling with all the emotion of our own breast but accord to the tenor of reasoning by which woman be keep from the tree of knowledge the important year of youth the usefulness of age and the rational hope of futurity be all to be sacrifice to render woman an object of desire for a short time besides how could rousseau expect them to be virtuous and constant when reason be neither allow to be the foundation of their virtue nor truth the object of their inquiry but all rousseau error in reason arose from sensibility and sensibility to their charm woman be very ready to forgive when he should have reason he become impassioned and reflection inflame hi imagination instead of enlighten hi understand even hi virtue also lead him far astray for bear with a warm constitution and lively fancy nature carry him toward the other sex with such eager fondness that he soon become lascivious had he give way to these desire the fire would have extinguish itself in a natural manner but virtue and a romantic kind of delicacy make him practise selfdenial yet when fear delicacy or virtue restrain him he debauch hi imagination and reflect on the sensation to which fancy give force he trace them in the most glowing colour and sink them deep into hi soul he then seek for solitude not to sleep with the man of nature or calmly investigate the cause of thing under the shade where sir isaac newton indulge contemplation but merely to indulge hi feeling and so warmly have he paint what he forcibly felt that interest the heart and inflame the imagination of hi reader in proportion to the strength of their fancy theyimagine that their understanding be convince when theyonly sympathize with a poetic writer who skilfully exhibit the object of sense most voluptuously shadow or gracefully veiled and thus make u feel whilst dream that we reason erroneous conclusion be leave in the mind why be rousseau life divide between ecstasy and misery can any other answer be give than this that the effervescence of hi imagination produce both but have hi fancy be allow to cool it be possible that he might have acquire more strength of mind still if the purpose of life be to educate the intellectual part of man all with respect to him be right yet have not death lead to a noble scene of action it be probable that he would have enjoy more equal happiness on earth and have felt the calm sensation of the man of nature instead of be prepare for another stage of existence by nourish the passion which agitate the civilized man but peace to hi mane i war not with hi ash but hi opinion i war only with the sensibility that lead him to degrade woman by make her the slave of love cursdvassalage first idolizd till love hot fire be oer then slave to those who court u before dryden the pernicious tendency of those book in which the writer insidiously degrade the sex whilst theybe prostrate before their personal charm can not be too often or too severely exposed let u my dear contemporary arise above such narrow prejudice if wisdom be desirable on it own account if virtue to deserve the name must be found on knowledge let u endeavour to strengthen our mind by reflection till our head become a balance for our heart let u not confine all our thought to the petty occurrence of the day nor our knowledge to an acquaintance with our lover or husband heart but let the practice of every duty be subordinate to the grand one of improve our mind and prepare our affection for a more exalted state beware then my friend of suffer the heart to be move by every trivial incident the reed be shake by a breeze and annually dy but the oak stand firm and for age brave the storm were we indeed only create to flutter our hour out and diewhy let u then indulge sensibility and laugh at the severity of reason yet alas even then we should want strength of body and mind and life would be lose in feverish pleasure or wearisome languor but the system of education which i earnestly wish to see exploded seem to presuppose what ought never to be take for grant that virtue shield u from the casualty of life and that fortune slip off her bandage will smile on a welleducated female and bring in her hand an emilius or a telemachus whilst on the contrary the reward which virtue promise to her votary be confine it be clear to their own bosom and often must theycontend with the most vexatious worldly care and bear with the vice and humour of relation for whom theycan never feel a friendship there have be many woman in the world who instead of be support by the reason and virtue of their father and brother have strengthen their own mind by struggle with their vice and folly yet have never meet with a hero in the shape of a husband who pay the debt that mankind owe them might chance to bring back their reason to it natural dependent state and restore the usurped prerogative of rise above opinion to man section dr fordyces sermon have long make a part of a young woman library nay girl at school be allow to read them but i should instantly dismiss them from my pupil if i wish to strengthen her understanding by lead her to form sound principle on a broad basis or be i only anxious to cultivate her taste though theymust be allow to contain many sensible observation dr fordyce may have have a very laudable end in view but these discourse be write in such an affected style that be it only on that account and have i nothing to object against hi mellifluous precept i should not allow girl to peruse them unless i design to hunt every spark of nature out of their composition melt every human quality into female weakness and artificial grace i say artificial for true grace arises from some kind of independence of mind child careless of pleasing and only anxious to amuse themselves be often very graceful and the nobility who have mostly live with inferior and always have the command of money acquire a graceful ease of deportment which should rather be term habitual grace of body than that superiour gracefulness which be truly the expression of the mind this mental grace not notice by vulgar eye often flash across a rough countenance and irradiate every feature show simplicity and independence of mind it be then we read character of immortality in the eye and see the soul in every gesture though when at rest neither the face nor limb may have much beauty to recommend them or the behaviour any thing peculiar to attract universal attention the mass of mankind however look for more tangible beauty yet simplicity be in general admire when people do not consider what theyadmire and can there be simplicity without sincerity but to have do with remark that be in some measure desultory though naturally excite by the subject in declamatory period dr fordyce spin out rousseau eloquence and in most sentimental rant detail hi opinion respect the female character and the behaviour which woman ought to assume to render her lovely he shall speak for himself for thus he make nature address man behold these smile innocent whom i have grace with my fair gift and commit to your protection behold them with love and respect treat them with tenderness and honour theybe timid and want to be defend theybe frail o do not take advantage of their weakness let their fear and blush endear them let their confidence in you never be abuse but be it possible that any of you can be such barbarian so supremely wicked a to abuse it can you find in your heart to despoil the gentle trusting creature of their treasure or do any thing to strip them of their native robe of virtue curst be the impious hand that would dare to violate the unblemished form of chastity thou wretch thou ruffian forbear nor venture to provoke heaven fierce vengeance i know not any comment that can be make seriously on this curious passage and i could produce many similar one and some so very sentimental that i have hear rational men use the word indecent when theymention them with disgust throughout there be a display of cold artificial feeling and that parade of sensibility which boys and girl should be teach to despise a the sure mark of a little vain mind florid appeal be make to heaven and to the beauteous innocent the fair image of heaven here below whilst sober sense be leave far behind this be not the language of the heart nor will it ever reach it though the ear may be tickle i shall be tell perhaps that the public have be please with these volume trueand herveys meditation be still read though he equally sin against sense and taste i particularly object to the loverlike phrase of pump up passion which be every where intersperse if woman be ever allow to walk without leadingstrings why must theybe cajole into virtue by artful flattery and sexual compliment speak to them the language of truth and soberness and away with the lullaby strain of condescend endearment let them be teach to respect themselves a rational creature and not lead to have a passion for their own insipid person it move my gall to hear a preacher descant on dress and needlework and still more to hear him address the british fair the fair of the fair a if theyhave only feeling even recommend piety he use the following argument never perhaps do a fine woman strike more deeply than when compose into pious recollection and possess with the noble consideration she assume without know it superiour dignity and new grace so that the beauty of holiness seem to radiate about her and the bystander be almost induce to fancy her already worship amongst her kindred angel why be woman to be thus breed up with a desire of conquest the very epithet use in this sense give me a sickly qualm doe religion and virtue offer no strong motives no brighter reward must theyalways be debase by be make to consider the sex of their companion must theybe teach always to be please and when level their small artillery at the heart of man be it necessary to tell them that a little sense be sufficient to render their attention incredibly soothing a a small degree of knowledge entertains in a woman so from a woman though for a different reason a small expression of kindness delight particularly if she have beauty i should have suppose for the same reason why be girl to be tell that theyresemble angel but to sink them below woman or that a gentle innocent female be an object that come near to the idea which we have form of angel than any other yet theybe tell at the same time that theybe only like angel when theybe young and beautiful consequently it be their person not their virtue that procure them this homage idle empty word what can such delusive flattery lead to but vanity and folly the lover it be true have a poetic licence to exalt hi mistress hi reason be the bubble of hi passion and he do not utter a falsehood when he borrow the language of adoration hi imagination may raise the idol of hi heart unblamed above humanity and happy would it be for woman if theybe only flatter by the men who love them i mean who love the individual not the sex but should a grave preacher interlard hi discourse with such foolery in sermon or novel however voluptuousness be always true to it text men be allow by moralist to cultivate a nature directs different quality and assume the different character that the same passion modify almost to infinity give to each individual a virtuous man may have a choleric or a sanguine constitution be gay or grave unreproved be firm till be be almost overbearing or weakly submissive have no will or opinion of hi own but all woman be to be level by meekness and docility into one character of yield softness and gentle compliance i will use the preacher own word let it be observe that in your sex manly exercise be never graceful that in them a tone and figure as well a an air and deportment of the masculine kind be always forbid and that men of sensibility desire in every woman soft feature and a flowing voice a form not robust and demeanour delicate and gentle be not the follow portraitthe portrait of a house slave i be astonish at the folly of many woman who be still reproach their husband for leave them alone for prefer this or that company to theirs for treat them with this and the other mark of disregard or indifference when to speak the truth theyhave themselves in a great measure to blame not that i would justify the men in any thing wrong on their part but have you behave to them with more respectful observance and a more equal tenderness studying their humour overlooking their mistake submitting to their opinion in matter indifferent passing by little instance of unevenness caprice or passion give soft answer to hasty word complain as seldom a possible and make it your daily care to relieve their anxiety and prevent their wish to enliven the hour of dulness and call up the idea of felicity have you pursue this conduct i doubt not but you would have maintain and even increase their esteem so far a to have secure every degree of influence that could conduce to their virtue or your mutual satisfaction and your house might at this day have be the abode of domestic bliss such a woman ought to be an angelor she be an assfor i discern not a trace of the human character neither reason nor passion in this domestic drudge whose be be absorb in that of a tyrant still dr fordyce must have very little acquaintance with the human heart if he really suppose that such conduct would bring back wander love instead of excite contempt no beauty gentleness etc etc may gain a heart but esteem the only lasting affection can alone be obtain by virtue support by reason it be respect for the understanding that keep alive tenderness for the person a these volume be so frequently put into the hand of young people i have take more notice of them than strictly speak theydeserve but a theyhave contribute to vitiate the taste and enervate the understanding of many of my fellowcreatures i could not pass them silently over section such paternal solicitude pervades dr gregory legacy to hi daughter that i enter on the task of criticism with affectionate respect but a this little volume have many attraction to recommend it to the notice of the most respectable part of my sex i can not silently pass over argument that so speciously support opinion which i think have have the most baneful effect on the moral and manner of the female world hi easy familiar style be particularly suit to the tenor of hi advice and the melancholy tenderness which hi respect for the memory of a beloved wife diffuses through the whole work render it very interesting yet there be a degree of concise elegance conspicuous in many passage that disturb this sympathy and we pop on the author when we only expect to meet thefather besides have two object in view he seldom adhere steadily to either for wish to make hi daughter amiable and fear l unhappiness should only be the consequence of instill sentiment that might draw them out of the track of common life without enable them to act with consonant independence and dignity he check the natural flow of hi thought and neither advise one thing nor the other in the preface he tell them a mournful truth that theywill hear at least once in their life the genuine sentiment of a man who have no interest in deceive them hapless woman what can be expect from thee when the being on whom thou art say naturally to depend for reason and support have all an interest in deceive thee this be the root of the evil that have shed a corrode mildew on all thy virtue and blight in the bud thy opening faculty have render thee the weak thing thou art it be this separate interest this insidious state of warfare that undermines morality and divide mankind if love have make some woman wretchedhow many more have the cold unmeaning intercourse of gallantry render vain and useless yet this heartless attention to the sex be reckon so manly so polite that till society be very differently organize i fear this vestige of gothic manner will not be do away by a more reasonable and affectionate mode of conduct besides to strip it of it imaginary dignity i must observe that in the most civilized european state this lipservice prevail in a very great degree accompany with extreme dissoluteness of moral in portugal the country that i particularly allude to it take place of the most serious moral obligation for a man be seldom assassinate when in the company of a woman the savage hand of rapine be unnerve by this chivalrous spirit and if the stroke of vengeance can not be stayedthe lady be entreat to pardon the rudeness and depart in peace though sprinkled perhaps with her husband or brother blood i shall pass over hi stricture on religion because i mean to discuss that subject in a separate chapter the remark relative to behaviour though many of them very sensible i entirely disapprove of because it appear to me to be begin a it be at the wrong end a cultivate understanding and an affectionate heart will never want starch rule of decorum something more substantial than seemliness will be the result and without understand the behaviour here recommend would be rank affectation decorum indeed be the one thing needful decorum be to supplant nature and banish all simplicity and variety of character out of the female world yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce it be however much easy to point out this or that mode of behaviour than to set the reason to work but when the mind have be store with useful knowledge and strengthen by be employ the regulation of the behaviour may safely be leave to it guidance why for instance should the following caution be give when art of every kind must contaminate the mind and why entangle the grand motif of action which reason and religion equally combine to enforce with pitiful worldly shift and slight of hand trick to gain the applause of gap tasteless fool be even cautious in display your good sense it will be think you assume a superiority over the rest of the company but if you happen to have any learning keep it a profound secret especially from the men who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great part and a cultivate understanding if men of real merit a he afterwards observes be superior to this meanness where be the necessity that the behaviour of the whole sex should be modulate to please fool or men who have little claim to respect a individual choose to keep close in their phalanx men indeed who insist on their common superiority have only this sexual superiority be certainly very excusable there would be no end to rule for behaviour if it be proper always to adopt the tone of the company for thus for ever vary the key a flat would often pass for a natural note surely it would have be wise to have advise woman to improve themselves till theyrise above the fume of vanity and then to let the public opinion come roundfor where be rule of accommodation to stop the narrow path of truth and virtue incline neither to the right nor leave it be a straightforward business and theywho be earnestly pursue their road may bind over many decorous prejudice without leave modesty behind make the heart clean and give the head employment and i will venture to predict that there will be nothing offensive in the behaviour the air of fashion which many young people be so eager to attain always strike me like the studied attitude of some modern print copy with tasteless servility after the antique the soul be leave out and none of the part be tie together by what may properly be term character this varnish of fashion which seldom stick very close to sense may dazzle the weak but leave nature to itself and it will seldom disgust the wise besides when a woman have sufficient sense not to pretend to any thing which she do not understand in some degree there be no need of determine to hide her talent under a bushel let thing take their natural course and all will be well it be this system of dissimulation throughout the volume that i despise woman be always to seem to be this and thatyet virtue might apostrophize them in the word of hamletseems i know not seemshave that within that passeth show still the same tone occur for in another place after recommend without sufficiently discriminate delicacy he add the men will complain of your reserve theywill assure you that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable but trust me theybe not sincere when theytell you so i acknowledge that on some occasion it might render you more agreeable a companion but it would make you less amiable a woman an important distinction which many of your sex be not aware of this desire of be always woman be the very consciousness that degrade the sex except with a lover i must repeat with emphasis a former observationit would be well if theybe only agreeable or rational companion but in this respect hi advice be even inconsistent with a passage which i mean to quote with the most marked approbation the sentiment that a woman may allow all innocent freedom provide her virtue be secure be both grossly indelicate and dangerous and have prove fatal to many of your sex with this opinion i perfectly coincide a man or a woman of any feeling must always wish to convince a beloved object that it be the caress of the individual not the sex that be receive and return with pleasure and that the heart rather than the sens be move without this natural delicacy love become a selfish personal gratification that soon degrade the character i carry this sentiment still further affection when love be out of the question authorise many personal endearment that naturally flow from an innocent heart give life to the behaviour but the personal intercourse of appetite gallantry or vanity be despicable when a man squeeze the hand of a pretty woman hand her to a carriage whom he have never see before she will consider such an impertinent freedom in the light of an insult if she have any true delicacy instead of be flatter by this unmeaning homage to beauty these be the privilege of friendship or the momentary homage which the heart pay to virtue when it flash suddenly on the noticemere animal spirit have no claim to the kindness of affection wishing to fee the affection with what be now the food of vanity i would fain persuade my sex to act from simple principle let them merit love and theywill obtain it though theymay never be tell that the power of a fine woman over the heart of men of men of the fine part be even beyond what she conceive i have already notice the narrow caution with respect to duplicity female softness delicacy of constitution for these be the change which he ring round without cease in a more decorous manner it be true than rousseau but it all come home to the same point and whoever be at the trouble to analyze these sentiment will find the first principle not quite so delicate a the superstructure the subject of amusement be treat in too cursory a manner but with the same spirit when i treat of friendship love and marriage it will be find that we materially differ in opinion i shall not then forestall what i have to observe on these important subject but confine my remark to the general tenor of them to that cautious family prudence to those confine view of partial unenlightened affection which exclude pleasure and improvement by vainly wish to ward off sorrow and errorand by thus guard the heart and mind destroy also all their energy it be far good to be often deceive than never to trust to be disappoint in love than never to love to lose a husband fondness than forfeit hi esteem happy would it be for the world and for individual of course if all this unavailing solicitude to attain worldly happiness on a confined plan be turn into an anxious desire to improve the understanding wisdom be the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding how long ye simple one will ye love simplicity and hate knowledge saith wisdom to the daughter of men section i do not mean to allude to all the writer who have write on the subject of female mannersit would in fact be only beat over the old ground for theyhave in general write in the same strain but attack the boasted prerogative of manthe prerogative that may emphatically be call the iron sceptre of tyranny the original sin of tyrant i declare against all power build on prejudice however hoary if the submission demand be found on justicethere be no appeal to a high powerfor god be justice itself let u then a child of the same parent if not bastardize by be the young born reason together and learn to submit to the authority of reason when her voice be distinctly hear but if it be prove that this throne of prerogative only rest on a chaotic mass of prejudice that have no inherent principle of order to keep them together or on an elephant tortoise or even the mighty shoulder of a son of the earth theymay escape who dare to brave the consequence without any breach of duty without sin against the order of thing whilst reason raise man above the brutal herd and death be big with promise theyalone be subject to blind authority who have no reliance on their own strength theybe free who will be free the be who can govern itself have nothing to fear in life but if any thing be dear than it own respect the price must be pay to the last farthing virtue like every thing valuable must be love for herself alone or she will not take up her abode with u she will not impart that peace which passeth understanding when she be merely make the stilt of reputation and respect with pharisaical exactness because honesty be the best policy that the plan of life which enable u to carry some knowledge and virtue into another world be the one best calculate to ensure content in this can not be deny yet few people act accord to this principle though it be universally allow that it admit not of dispute present pleasure or present power carry before it these sober conviction and it be for the day not for life that man bargain with happiness how few how very few have sufficient foresight or resolution to endure a small evil at the moment to avoid a great hereafter woman in particular whose virtue be build on mutual prejudice seldom attain to this greatness of mind so that become the slave of her own feeling she be easily subjugate by those of other thus degrade her reason her misty reason be employ rather to burnish than to snap her chain indignantly have i hear woman argue in the same track a men and adopt the sentiment that brutalize them with all the pertinacity of ignorance i must illustrate my assertion by a few example mr piozzi who often repeat by rote what she do not understand come forward with johnsonian period seek not for happiness in singularity and dread a refinement of wisdom a a deviation into folly thus she dogmatically address a new married man and to elucidate this pompous exordium she add i say that the person of your lady would not grow more pleasing to you but pray let her never suspect that it grow less so that a woman will pardon an affront to her understanding much sooner than one to her person be well know nor will any of u contradict the assertion all our attainment all our art be employ to gain and keep the heart of man and what mortification can exceed the disappointment if the end be not obtain there be no reproof however point no punishment however severe that a woman of spirit will not prefer to neglect and if she can endure it without complaint it only prove that she mean to make herself amends by the attention of other for the slight of her husband these be true masculine sentiment all our art be employ to gain and keep the heart of manand what be the inferenceif her person and be there ever a person though form with medicisan symmetry that be not slight be neglect she will make herself amends by endeavour to please other men noble morality but thus be the understanding of the whole sex affront and their virtue deprive of the common basis of virtue a woman must know that her person can not be a please to her husband a it be to her lover and if she be offend with him for be a human creature she may as well whine about the loss of hi heart a about any other foolish thing and this very want of discernment or unreasonable anger prove that he could not change hi fondness for her person into affection for her virtue or respect for her understanding whilst woman avow and act up to such opinion their understanding at least deserve the contempt and obloquy that men who never insult their person have pointedly level at the female mind and it be the sentiment of these polite men who do not wish to be encumber with mind that vain woman thoughtlessly adopt yet theyshould know that insulted reason alone can spread that sacred reserve about the person which render human affection for human affection have always some base alloy as permanent a be consistent with the grand end of existencethe attainment of virtue the baroness de stael speak the same language a the lady just cite with more enthusiasm her eulogium on rousseau be accidentally put into my hand and her sentiments the sentiment of too many of my sex may serve a the text for a few comment though rousseau she observe have endeavour to prevent woman from interfere in public affair and act a brilliant part in the theatre of politics yet in speaking of them how much have he do it to their satisfaction if he wish to deprive them of some right foreign to their sex how have he for ever restore to them all those to which it have a claim and in attempt to diminish their influence over the deliberation of men how sacredly have he establish the empire theyhave over their happiness in aid them to descend from an usurped throne he have firmly seat them upon that to which theybe destine by nature and though he be full of indignation against them when theyendeavour to resemble men yet when theycome before him with all the charm weakness virtue and error of their sex hi respect for their person amount almost to adoration truefor never be there a sensualist who pay more fervent adoration at the shrine of beauty so devout indeed be hi respect for the person that except the virtue of chastity for obvious reason he only wish to see it embellish by charm weakness and error he be afraid l the austerity of reason should disturb the soft playfulness of love the master wish to have a meretricious slave to fondle entirely dependent on hi reason and bounty he do not want a companion whom he should be compel to esteem or a friend to whom he could confide the care of hi children education should death deprive them of their father before he have fulfil the sacred task he deny woman reason shut her out from knowledge and turn her aside from truth yet hi pardon be grant because he admit the passion of love it would require some ingenuity to show why woman be to be under such an obligation to him for thus admit love when it be clear that he admit it only for the relaxation of men and to perpetuate the specie but he talk with passion and that powerful spell work on the sensibility of a young encomiast what signify it pursue this rhapsodist to woman that hi reason dispute with them the empire when hi heart be devotedly theirs it be not empirebut equality that theyshould contend for yet if theyonly wish to lengthen out their sway theyshould not entirely trust to their person for though beauty may gain a heart it can not keep it even while the beauty be in full bloom unless the mind lend at least some grace when woman be once sufficiently enlighten to discover their real interest on a grand scale theywill i be persuaded be very ready to resign all the prerogative of love that be not mutual speaking of them a last prerogative for the calm satisfaction of friendship and the tender confidence of habitual esteem before marriage theywill not assume any insolent air nor afterward abjectly submit but endeavour to act like reasonable creature in both situation theywill not be tumble from a throne to a stool madame genlis have write several entertain book for child and her letter on education afford many useful hint that sensible parent will certainly avail themselves of but her view be narrow and her prejudice as unreasonable a strong i shall pass over her vehement argument in favour of the eternity of future punishment because i blush to think that a human be should ever argue vehemently in such a cause and only make a few remark on her absurd manner of make the parental authority supplant reason for every where do she inculcate not only blind submission to parent but to the opinion of the world she tell a story of a young man engage by hi father express desire to a girl of fortune before the marriage could take place she be deprive of her fortune and thrown friendless on the world the father practise the most infamous art to separate hi son from her and when the son detect hi villany and follow the dictate of honour marries the girl nothing but misery ensues because forsooth he marry without hi father consent on what ground can religion or morality rest when justice be thus set at defiance in the same style she represent an accomplished young woman a ready to marry any body that her mamma please to recommend and a actually marry the young man of her own choice without feel any emotion of passion because that a well educate girl have not time to be in love be it possible to have much respect for a system of education that thus insult reason and nature many similar opinion occur in her writing mixed with sentiment that do honour to her head and heart yet so much superstition be mixed with her religion and so much worldly wisdom with her morality that i should not let a young person read her work unless i could afterwards converse on the subject and point out the contradiction mr chapones letter be write with such good sense and unaffected humility and contain so many useful observation that i only mention them to pay the worthy writer this tribute of respect i can not it be true always coincide in opinion with her but i always respect her the very word respect bring mr macaulay to my remembrance the woman of the great ability undoubtedly that this country have ever produce and yet this woman have be suffer to die without sufficient respect be pay to her memory posterity however will be more just and remember that catharine macaulay be an example of intellectual acquirement suppose to be incompatible with the weakness of her sex in her style of write indeed no sex appear for it be like the sense it convey strong and clear i will not call hers a masculine understanding because i admit not of such an arrogant assumption of reason but i contend that it be a sound one and that her judgment the matured fruit of profound thinking be a proof that a woman can acquire judgment in the full extent of the word possessing more penetration than sagacity more understanding than fancy she write with sober energy and argumentative closeness yet sympathy and benevolence give an interest to her sentiment and that vital heat to argument which force the reader to weigh them when i first think of write these stricture i anticipate mr macaulay approbation with a little of that sanguine ardour which it have be the business of my life to depress but soon heard with the sickly qualm of disappointed hope and the still seriousness of regretthat she be no more section take a view of the different work which have be write on education lord chesterfield letter must not be silently pass over not that i mean to analyze hi unmanly immoral system or even to cull any of the useful shrewd remark which occur in hi frivolous correspondenceno i only mean to make a few reflection on the avowed tendency of themthe art of acquire an early knowledge of the world an art i will venture to assert that prey secretly like the worm in the bud on the expand power and turn to poison the generous juice which should mount with vigour in the youthful frame inspire warm affection and great resolve for every thing saith the wise man there be reason and who would look for the fruit of autumn during the genial month of spring but this be mere declamation and i mean to reason with those worldlywise instructor who instead of cultivate the judgment instil prejudice and render hard the heart that gradual experience would only have cool an early acquaintance with human infirmity or what be term knowledge of the world be the sure way in my opinion to contract the heart and damp the natural youthful ardour which produce not only great talent but great virtue for the vain attempt to bring forth the fruit of experience before the sapling have throw out it leaf only exhaust it strength and prevent it assume a natural form just a the form and strength of subsiding metal be injure when the attraction of cohesion be disturb tell me ye who have study the human mind be it not a strange way to fix principle by show young people that theybe seldom stable and how can theybe fortify by habit when theybe prove to be fallacious by example why be the ardour of youth thus to be damp and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick this dry caution may it be true guard a character from worldly mischance but will infallibly preclude excellence in either virtue or knowledge the stumblingblock throw across every path by suspicion will prevent any vigorous exertion of genius or benevolence and life will be strip of it most alluring charm long before it calm evening when man should retire to contemplation for comfort and support a young man who have be breed up with domestic friend and lead to store hi mind with as much speculative knowledge a can be acquire by read and the natural reflection which youthful ebullition of animal spirit and instinctive feeling inspire will enter the world with warm and erroneous expectation but this appear to be the course of nature and in moral as well a in work of taste we should be observant of her sacred indication and not presume to lead when we ought obsequiously to follow in the world few people act from principle present feeling and early habit be the grand spring but how would the former be deaden and the latter render iron corrode fetter if the world be show to young people just a it be when no knowledge of mankind or their own heart slowly obtain by experience render them forbear their fellow creature would not then be view a frail being like themselves condemn to struggle with human infirmity and sometimes display the light and sometimes the dark side of their character extort alternate feeling of love and disgust but guard against a beast of prey till every enlarge social feeling in a wordhumanity be eradicate in life on the contrary a we gradually discover the imperfection of our nature we discover virtue and various circumstance attach u to our fellow creature when we mix with them and view the same object that be never think of in acquire a hasty unnatural knowledge of the world we see a folly swell into a vice by almost imperceptible degree and pity while we blame but if the hideous monster burst suddenly on our sight fear and disgust render u more severe than man ought to be might lead u with blind zeal to usurp the character of omnipotence and denounce damnation on our fellow mortal forget that we can not read the heart and that we have seed of the same vice lurk in our own i have already remark that we expect more from instruction than mere instruction can produce for instead of prepare young people to encounter the evil of life with dignity and to acquire wisdom and virtue by the exercise of their own faculty precept be heap upon precept and blind obedience require when conviction should be bring home to reason suppose for instance that a young person in the first ardour of friendship deify the beloved objectwhat harm can arise from this mistake enthusiastic attachment perhaps it be necessary for virtue first to appear in a human form to impress youthful heart the ideal model which a more matured and exalted mind look up to and shape for itself would elude their sight he who love not hi brother whom he hath see how can he love god ask the wise of men it be natural for youth to adorn the first object of it affection with every good quality and the emulation produce by ignorance or to speak with more propriety by inexperience brings forward the mind capable of form such an affection and when in the lapse of time perfection be find not to be within the reach of mortal virtue abstractly be think beautiful and wisdom sublime admiration then give place to friendship properly so call because it be cement by esteem and the be walk alone only dependent on heaven for that emulous panting after perfection which ever glow in a noble mind but this knowledge a man must gain by the exertion of hi own faculty and this be surely the blessed fruit of disappointed hope for he who delighteth to diffuse happiness and show mercy to the weak creature who be learn to know him never implant a good propensity to be a tormenting ignis fatuus our tree be now allow to spread with wild luxuriance nor do we expect by force to combine the majestic mark of time with youthful grace but wait patiently till theyhave strike deep their root and brave many a storm be the mind then which in proportion to it dignity advance more slowly towards perfection to be treat with less respect to argue from analogy every thing around u be in a progressive state and when an unwelcome knowledge of life produce almost a satiety of life and we discover by the natural course of thing that all that be do under the sun be vanity we be draw near the awful close of the drama the day of activity and hope be over and the opportunity which the first stage of existence have afford of advance in the scale of intelligence must soon be sum up a knowledge at this period of the futility of life or early if obtain by experience be very useful because it be natural but when a frail be be show the folly and vice of man that he may be teach prudently to guard against the common casualty of life by sacrifice hi heartsurely it be not speak harshly to call it the wisdom of this world contrast with the nobler fruit of piety and experience i will venture a paradox and deliver my opinion without reserve if men be only bear to form a circle of life and death it would be wise to take every step that foresight could suggest to render life happy moderation in every pursuit would then be supreme wisdom and the prudent voluptuary might enjoy a degree of content though he neither cultivate hi understanding nor keep hi heart pure prudence supposing we be mortal would be true wisdom or to be more explicit would procure the great portion of happiness consider the whole of life but knowledge beyond the convenience of life would be a curse why should we injure our health by close study the exalt pleasure which intellectual pursuit afford would scarcely be equivalent to the hour of languor that follow especially if it be necessary to take into the reckon the doubt and disappointment that cloud our research vanity and vexation close every inquiry for the cause which we particularly wish to discover fly like the horizon before u a we advance the ignorant on the contrary resemble child and suppose that if theycould walk straight forward theyshould at last arrive where the earth and clouds meet yet disappoint a we be in our research the mind gain strength by the exercise sufficient perhaps to comprehend the answer which in another step of existence it may receive to the anxious question it ask when the understanding with feeble wing be flutter round the visible effect to dive into the hidden cause the passion also the wind of life would be useless if not injurious do the substance which compose our thinking be after we have think in vain only become the support of vegetable life and invigorate a cabbage or blush in a rise the appetite would answer every earthly purpose and produce more moderate and permanent happiness but the power of the soul that be of little use here and probably disturb our animal enjoyment even while conscious dignity make u glory in possess them prove that life be merely an education a state of infancy of which the only hop worth cherish should not be sacrifice i mean therefore to infer that we ought to have a precise idea of what we wish to attain by education for the immortality of the soul be contradict by the action of many people who firmly profess the belief if you mean to secure ease and prosperity on earth a the first consideration and leave futurity to provide for itself you act prudently in give your child an early insight into the weakness of hi nature you may not it be true make an inkle of him but do not imagine that he will stick to more than the letter of the law who have very early imbibe a mean opinion of human nature nor will he think it necessary to rise much above the common standard he may avoid gross vice because honesty be the best policy but he will never aim at attain great virtue the example of writer and artist will illustrate this remark i must therefore venture to doubt whether what have be think an axiom in moral may not have be a dogmatical assertion make by men who have coolly see mankind through the medium of book and say in direct contradiction to them that the regulation of the passion be not always wisdom on the contrary it should seem that one reason why men have superiour judgment and more fortitude than woman be undoubtedly this that theygive a freer scope to the grand passion and by more frequently go astray enlarge their mind if then by the exercise of their own reason theyfix on some stable principle theyhave probably to thank the force of their passion nourish by false view of life and permit to overleap the boundary that secure content but if in the dawn of life we could soberly survey the scene before u a in perspective and see every thing in it true colour how could the passion gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculty let me now a from an eminence survey the world stripped of all it false delusive charm the clear atmosphere enable me to see each object in it true point of view while my heart be still i be calm a the prospect in a morning when the mist slowly disperse silently unveil the beauty of nature refresh by rest in what light will the world now appear i rub my eye and think perchance that i be just awake from a lively dream i see the son and daughter of men pursue shadow and anxiously waste their power to fee passion which have no adequate objectif the very excess of these blind impulse pamper by that lie yet constantlytrusted guide the imagination do not by prepare them for some other state render short sight mortal wiser without their own concurrence or what come to the same thing when theybe pursue some imaginary present good after view object in this light it would not be very fanciful to imagine that this world be a stage on which a pantomime be daily perform for the amusement of superiour being how would theybe divert to see the ambitious man consume himself by run after a phantom and pursue the bubble fame in the cannon mouth that be to blow him to nothing for when consciousness be lose it matter not whether we mount in a whirlwind or descend in rain and should theycompassionately invigorate hi sight and show him the thorny path which lead to eminence that like a quicksand sink a he ascend disappoint hi hope when almost within hi grasp would he not leave to other the honour of amuse them and labour to secure the present moment though from the constitution of hi nature he would not find it very easy to catch the fly stream such slave be we to hope and fear but vain a the ambitious man pursuit would be he be often strive for something more substantial than famethat indeed would be the veriest meteor the wild fire that could lure a man to ruin what renounce the most trifling gratification to be applaud when he should be no more wherefore this struggle whether man be mortal or immortal if that noble passion do not really raise the be above hi fellow and love what divert scene would it producepantaloons trick must yield to more egregious folly to see a mortal adorn an object with imaginary charm and then fall down and worship the idol which he have himself set uphow ridiculous but what serious consequence ensue to rob man of that portion of happiness which the deity by call him into existence have or on what can hi attribute rest indubitably promise would not all the purpose of life have be much well fulfil if he have only felt what have be term physical love and would not the sight of the object not see through the medium of the imagination soon reduce the passion to an appetite if reflection the noble distinction of man do not give it force and make it an instrument to raise him above this earthy dross by teach him to love the centre of all perfection whose wisdom appear clear and clear in the work of nature in proportion a reason be illuminate and exalt by contemplation and by acquire that love of order which the struggle of passion produce the habit of reflection and the knowledge attain by foster any passion might be show to be equally useful though the object be prove equally fallacious for theywould all appear in the same light if theybe not magnify by the govern passion implant in u by the author of all good to call forth and strengthen the faculty of each individual and enable it to attain all the experience that an infant can obtain who do certain thing it can not tell why i descend from my height and mixing with my fellow creature feel myself hurry along the common stream ambition love hope and fear exert their wonted power though we be convince by reason that their present and most attractive promise be only lie dream but have the cold hand of circumspection damp each generous feeling before it have leave any permanent character or fix some habit what could be expect but selfish prudence and reason just rise above instinct who that have read dean swift disgust description of the yahoo and insipid one of houyhnhnm with a philosophical eye can avoid see the futility of degrade the passion or make man rest in contentment the youth should act for have he the experience of a grey head he would be fit for death than life though hi virtue rather reside in hi head than hi heart could produce nothing great and hi understanding prepare for this world would not by it noble flight prove that it have a title to a good besides it be not possible to give a young person a just view of life he must have struggle with hi own passion before he can estimate the force of the temptation which betray hi brother into vice those who be enter life and those who be depart see the world from such very different point of view that theycan seldom think alike unless the unfledged reason of the former never attempt a solitary flight when we hear of some dare crimeit come full upon u in the deep shade of turpitude and raise indignation but the eye that gradually saw the darkness thicken must observe it with more compassionate forbearance the world can not be see by an unmoved spectator we must mix in the throng and feel a men feel before we can judge of their feeling if we mean in short to live in the world to grow wiser and good and not merely to enjoy the good thing of life we must attain a knowledge of other at the same time that we become acquainted with ourselves knowledge acquire any other way only harden the heart and perplex the understanding i may be tell that the knowledge thus acquire be sometimes purchase at too dear a rate i can only answer that i very much doubt whether any knowledge can be attain without labour and sorrow and those who wish to spare their child both should not complain if theybe neither wise nor virtuous theyonly aim at make them prudent and prudence early in life be but the cautious craft of ignorant selflove i have observe that young people to whose education particular attention have be pay have in general be very superficial and conceited and far from please in any respect because theyhave neither the unsuspecting warmth of youth nor the cool depth of age i can not help impute this unnatural appearance principally to that hasty premature instruction which lead them presumptuously to repeat all the crude notion theyhave take upon trust so that the careful education which theyreceive make them all their life the slave of prejudice mental as well a bodily exertion be at first irksome so much so that the many would fain let other both work and think for them an observation which i have often make will illustrate my meaning when in a circle of stranger or acquaintance a person of moderate ability assert an opinion with heat i will venture to affirm for i have trace this fact home very often that it be a prejudice these echo have a high respect for the understanding of some relation or friend and without fully comprehend the opinion which theybe so eager to retail theymaintain them with a degree of obstinacy that would surprise even the person who concoct them i know that a kind of fashion now prevail of respect prejudice and when any one dare to face them though actuate by humanity and arm by reason he be superciliously ask whether hi ancestor be fools no i should reply opinion at first of every description be all probably consider and therefore be found on some reason yet not unfrequently of course it be rather a local expedient than a fundamental principle that would be reasonable at all time but mosscovered opinion assume the disproportioned form of prejudice when theybe indolently adopt only because age have give them a venerable aspect though the reason on which theybe build cease to be a reason or can not be trace why be we to love prejudice merely because theybe prejudice a prejudice be a fond obstinate persuasion for which we can give no reason for the moment a reason can be give for an opinion it cease to be a prejudice though it may be an error in judgment and be we then advise to cherish opinion only to set reason at defiance this mode of argue if argue it may be call remind me of what be vulgarly term a woman reason for woman sometimes declare that theylove or believe certain thing because theylove or believe them it be impossible to converse with people to any purpose who in this style only use affirmative and negative before you can bring them to a point to start fairly from you must go back to the simple principle that be antecedent to the prejudice broach by power and it be ten to one but you be stop by the philosophical assertion that certain principle be a practically false a theybe abstractly true nay it may be infer that reason have whisper some doubt for it generally happen that people assert their opinion with the great heat when theybegin to waver strive to drive out their own doubt by convince their opponent theygrow angry when those gnaw doubt be throw back to prey on themselves the fact be that men expect from education what education can not give a sagacious parent or tutor may strengthen the body and sharpen the instrument by which the child be to gather knowledge but the honey must be the reward of the individual own industry it be almost a absurd to attempt to make a youth wise by the experience of another a to expect the body to grow strong by the exercise which be only talked of or see many of those child whose conduct have be most narrowly watched become the weak men because their instructor only instill certain notion into their mind that have no other foundation than their authority and if theybe love or respect the mind be cramp in it exertion and waver in it advance the business of education in this case be only to conduct the shooting tendrils to a proper pole yet after lay precept upon precept without allow a child to acquire judgment itself parent expect them to act in the same manner by this borrow fallacious light a if theyhave illuminate it themselves and be when theyenter life what their parent be at the close theydo not consider that the tree and even the human body do not strengthen it fibre till it have reach it full growth there appear to be something analogous in the mind the sens and the imagination give a form to the character during childhood and youth and the understanding a life advance give firmness to the first fair purpose of sensibilitytill virtue arise rather from the clear conviction of reason than the impulse of the heart morality be make to rest on a rock against which the storm of passion vainly beat i hope i shall not be misunderstood when i say that religion will not have this condense energy unless it be found on reason if it be merely the refuge of weakness or wild fanaticism and not a govern principle of conduct drawn from selfknowledge and a rational opinion respect the attribute of god what can it be expect to produce the religion which consist in warm the affection and exalt the imagination be only the poetical part and may afford the individual pleasure without render it a more moral be it may be a substitute for worldly pursuits yet narrow instead of enlarge the heart but virtue must be love a in itself sublime and excellent and not for the advantage it procure or the evil it avert if any great degree of excellence be expect men will not become moral when theyonly build airy castle in a future world to compensate for the disappointment which theymeet with in this if theyturn their thought from relative duty to religious revery most prospect in life be mar by the shuffle worldly wisdom of men who forget that theycan not serve god and mammon endeavour to blend contradictory thing if you wish to make your son rich pursue one course if you be only anxious to make him virtuous you must take another but do not imagine that you can bind from one road to the other without lose your way barbauld in miscellaneous piece in prose chapter the effect which an early association of idea ha upon the character educated in the enervating style recommend by the writer on whom i have be animadvert and not have a chance from their subordinate state in society to recover their lose ground be it surprise that woman every where appear a defect in nature be it surprise when we consider what a determinate effect an early association of idea have on the character that theyneglect their understanding and turn all their attention to their person the great advantage which naturally result from store the mind with knowledge be obvious from the following consideration the association of our idea be either habitual or instantaneous and the latter mode seem rather to depend on the original temperature of the mind than on the will when the idea and matter of fact be once take in theylie by for use till some fortuitous circumstance make the information dart into the mind with illustrative force that have be receive at very different period of our life like the lightning flash be many recollection one idea assimilating and explain another with astonish rapidity i do not now allude to that quick perception of truth which be so intuitive that it baffle research and make u at a loss to determine whether it be reminiscence or ratiocination lose sight of in it celerity that open the dark cloud over those instantaneous association we have little power for when the mind be once enlarge by excursive flight or profound reflection the raw material will in some degree arrange themselves the understand it be true may keep u from go out of draw when we group our thought or transcribe from the imagination the warm sketch of fancy but the animal spirit the individual character give the colouring over this subtile electric fluid how little power do we possess and over it how little power can reason obtain these fine intractable spirit appear to be the essence of genius and beaming in it eagle eye produce in the most eminent degree the happy energy of associate thought that surprise delight and instruct these be the glow mind that concentrate picture for their fellowcreatures force them to view with interest the object reflect from the impassioned imagination which theypass over in nature i must be allow to explain myself the generality of people can not see or feel poetically theywant fancy and therefore fly from solitude in search of sensible object but when an author lend them hi eye theycan see a he saw and be amuse by image theycould not select though lie before them education thus only supply the man of genius with knowledge to give variety and contrast to hi association but there be an habitual association of idea that grow with our growth which have a great effect on the moral character of mankind and by which a turn be give to the mind that commonly remain throughout life so ductile be the understanding and yet so stubborn that the association which depend on adventitious circumstance during the period that the body take to arrive at maturity can seldom be disentangle by reason one idea call up another it old associate and memory faithful to the first impression particularly when the intellectual power be not employ to cool our sensation retrace them with mechanical exactness this habitual slavery to first impression have a more baneful effect on the female than the male character because business and other dry employment of the understanding tend to deaden the feeling and break association that do violence to reason but female who be make woman of when theybe mere child and bring back to childhood when theyought to leave the gocart forever have not sufficient strength of mind to efface the superinductions of art that have smother nature every thing that theysee or hear serf to fix impression call forth emotion and associate idea that give a sexual character to the mind false notion of beauty and delicacy stop the growth of their limb and produce a sickly soreness rather than delicacy of organ and thus weaken by be employ in unfold instead of examine the first association force on them by every surround object how can theyattain the vigour necessary to enable them to throw off their factitious characterwhere find strength to recur to reason and rise superior to a system of oppression that blast the fair promise of spring this cruel association of idea which every thing conspire to twist into all their habit of thinking or to speak with more precision of feel receives new force when theybegin to act a little for themselves for theythen perceive that it be only through their address to excite emotion in men that pleasure and power be to be

as well a cruel to upbraid them with fault that can scarcely be avoid unless a degree of native vigour be suppose that fall to the lot of very few amongst mankind for instance the severe sarcasm have

a passion for a scarlet coat be so natural that it never surprise me and allow pope summary of their character to be just that every woman be at heart a rake why should theybe bitterly censure for seek a congenial mind and prefer a rake to a man of sense rake know how to work on their sensibility whilst the modest merit of reasonable men have of course less effect on their feeling and theycan not reach the heart by the way of the understanding because theyhave few sentiment in common it seem a little absurd to expect woman to be more reasonable than men in their liking and still to deny them the uncontroled use of reason when do men fall in love with sense when do theywith their superior power and advantage turn from the person to the mind and how can they
