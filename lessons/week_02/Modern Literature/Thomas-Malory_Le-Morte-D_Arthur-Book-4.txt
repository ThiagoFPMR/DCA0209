and come again to the court and be make knight of the round table so on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventure then it befall that arthur and many of hi knight rode ahunting into a great forest and it hap king arthur king uriens and sir accolon of gaul follow a great hart for they three be well horse and so they chase so fast that within a while they three be then ten mile from their

lay in their bed easily and anon they fell asleep and sleep marvellously sore all the night and on the morrow king uriens be in camelot abed in hi wife arm morgan le fay and when he awake he have great marvel how he come there for on the even afore he be two day journey from camelot and when king arthur awake he find himself in a dark prison hear about him many complaint of woful knight what

knight this lord of this castle hi name be sir dama and he be the false knight that liveth and full of treason and a very coward a any liveth and he hath a young brother a good knight of prowess hi name be sir ontzlake and this traitor damas the elder brother will give him no part of hi livelihood but a sir ontzlake keepeth thorough prowess of hi hand and so he keepeth from him a full fair manor and a rich and therein sir ontzlake dwelleth worship and be well beloved of all people and this sir dama our master be a evil beloved for he be without mercy and he be a coward and great war hath be betwixt them both but ontzlake hath ever the good and ever he proffereth sir dama to fight for the livelihood body for body but he will not do otherelse to find a knight to fight for him unto that sir dama have grant to find a knight but he be so evil beloved and hat that there be never a knight will fight for him and when dama saw this that there be never a knight would fight for him he hath daily lain await with many knight with him and take all the knight in this country to see and espy their adventure he hath take them by force and bring them to hi prison and so he take u separately a we ride on our adventure and many good knight have die in this prison for hunger to the number of eighteen knight and if any of u all that here be or hath be would have foughten with hi brother ontzlake he would have deliver u but for because this dama be so false and so full of treason we would never fight for him to die for it and we be so lean for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our foot god deliver you for hi mercy say arthur anon therewithal there come a damosel unto arthur and ask him what cheer i can not say say he sir say she an ye will fight for my lord ye shall be deliver out of prison and els ye escape never the life now say arthur that be hard yet have i liefer to fight with a knight than to die in prison with this say arthur i may be deliver and all these prisoner i will do the battle yes say the damosel i be ready say arthur an i have horse and armour ye shall lack none say the damosel meseemeth damosel i should have see you in the court of arthur nay say the damosel i come never there i be the lord daughter of this castle yet be she false for she be one of the damosel of morgan le fay anon she go unto sir dama and tell him how he would do battle for him and so he send for arthur and when he come he be well colour and well make of hi limb that all knight that saw him say it be pity that such a knight should die in prison so sir dama and he be agree that he should fight for him upon this covenant that all other knight should be deliver and unto that be sir dama swear unto arthur and also to do the battle to the uttermost and with that all the twenty knight be bring out of the dark prison into the hall and deliver and so they all abide to see the battle now turn we unto accolon of gaul that when he awake he find himself by a deep wellside within half a foot in great peril of death and there come out of that fountain a pipe of silver and out of that pipe run water all on high in a stone of marble when sir accolon saw this he bless him and say jesus save my lord king arthur and king uriens for these damosel in this ship have betray u they be devil and no woman and if i may escape this misadventure i shall destroy all where i may find these false damosel that use enchantment right with that there come a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat nose and salute sir accolon and say how he come from queen morgan le fay and she greeteth you well and biddeth you be of strong heart for ye shall fight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime and therefore she hath sent you here excalibur arthur sword and the scabbard and she biddeth you a ye love her that ye do the battle to the uttermost without any mercy like a ye have promise her when ye spake together in privity and what damosel that bringeth her the knight head which ye shall fight withal she will make her a queen now i understand you well say accolon i shall hold that i have promise her now i have the sword when saw ye my lady queen morgan le fay right late say the dwarf then accolon take him in hi arm and say recommend me unto my lady queen and tell her all shall be do that i have promise her and els i will die for it now i suppose say accolon she hath make all these craft and enchantment for this battle ye may well believe it say the dwarf right so there come a knight and a lady with six squire and salute accolon and pray him for to arise and come and rest him at hi manor and so accolon mount upon a void horse and go with the knight unto a fair manor by a priory and there he have pass good cheer then sir dama send unto hi brother sir ontzlake and bid make him ready by tomorn at the hour of prime and to be in the field to fight with a good knight for he have find a good knight that be ready to do battle at all point when this word come unto sir ontzlake he be pass heavy for he be wound a little tofore through both hi thigh with a spear and make great dole but a he be wound he would have take the battle on hand so it hap at that time by the mean of morgan le fay accolon be with sir ontzlake lodge and when he hear of that battle and how ontzlake be wound he say that he would fight for him because morgan le fay have send him excalibur and the sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn this be the cause sir accolon take the battle on hand then sir ontzlake be pass glad and thank sir accolon with all hi heart that he would do so much for him and therewithal sir ontzlake send word unto hi brother sir dama that he have a knight that for him should be ready in the field by the hour of prime so on the morn sir arthur be arm and well horse and ask sir dama when shall we to the field sir say sir dama ye shall hear mass and so arthur hear a mass and when mass be do there come a squire on a great horse and ask sir dama if hi knight be ready for our knight be ready in the field then sir arthur mount upon horseback and there be all the knight and common of that country and so by all advice there be choose twelve good men of the country for to wait upon the two knight and right a arthur be on horseback there come a damosel from morgan le fay and bring unto sir arthur a sword like unto excalibur and the scabbard and say unto arthur morgan le fay sendeth here your sword for great love and he thank her and weened it have be so but she be false for the sword and the scabbard be counterfeit and brittle and false and then they dress them on both party of the field and let their horse run so fast that either smite other in the midst of the shield with their spearhead that both horse and man go to the earth and then they start up both and pull out their sword the meanwhile that they be thus at the battle come the damosel of the lake into the field that put merlin under the stone and she come thither for love of king arthur for she know how morgan le fay have so ordain that king arthur should have be slain that day and therefore she come to save hi life and so they go eagerly to the battle and give many great stroke but always arthur sword bit not like accolons sword but for the most part every stroke that accolon give he wound sore arthur that it be marvel he stand and always hi blood fell from him fast when arthur behold the ground so sore bebled he be dismay and then he deem treason that hi sword be change for hi sword bit not steel a it be wont to do therefore he dread him sore to be dead for ever him seem that the sword in accolons hand be excalibur for at every stroke that accolon strike he draw blood on arthur now knight say accolon unto arthur keep thee well from me but arthur answer not again and give him such a buffet on the helm that it make him to stoop nigh fall down to the earth then sir accolon withdraw him a little and come on with excalibur on high and smote sir arthur such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth then be they wroth both and give each other many sore stroke but always sir arthur lose so much blood that it be marvel he stand on hi foot but he be so full of knighthood that knightly he endure the pain and sir accolon lose not a deal of blood therefore he wax pass light and sir arthur be pass feeble and weened verily to have die but for all that he make countenance a though he might endure and hold accolon as short a he might but accolon be so bold because of excalibur that he wax pass hardy but all men that behold him say they saw never knight fight so well a arthur do consider the blood that he bleed so be all the people sorry for him but the two brother would not accord then always they fight together a fierce knight and sir arthur withdraw him a little for to rest him and sir accolon call him to battle and say it be no time for me to suffer thee to rest and therewith he come fiercely upon arthur and sir arthur be wroth for the blood that he have lose and smote accolon on high upon the helm so mightily that he make him nigh to fall to the earth and therewith arthur sword brast at the cross and fell in the grass among the blood and the pommel and the sure handle he hold in hi hand when sir arthur saw that he be in great fear to die but always he hold up hi shield and lose no ground nor bat no cheer then sir accolon begin with word of treason and say knight thou art overcome and mayst not endure and also thou art weaponless and thou hast lose much of thy blood and i be full loath to slay thee therefore yield thee to me a recreant nay say sir arthur i may not so for i have promise to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith of my body while me lasteth the life and therefore i have liefer to die with honour than to live with shame and if it be possible for me to die an hundred time i have liefer to die so oft than yield me to thee for though i lack weapon i shall lack no worship and if thou slay me weaponless that shall be thy shame well say accolon a for the shame i will not spare now keep thee from me for thou art but a dead man and therewith accolon give him such a stroke that he fell nigh to the earth and would have have arthur to have cry him mercy but sir arthur press unto accolon with hi shield and give him with the pommel in hi hand such a buffet that he go three stride aback when the damosel of the lake beheld arthur how full of prowess hi body be and the false treason that be work for him to have have him slay she have great pity that so good a knight and such a man of worship should so be destroy and at the next stroke sir accolon strike him such a stroke that by the damosel enchantment the sword excalibur fell out of accolons hand to the earth and therewithal sir arthur lightly leap to it and gat it in hi hand and forthwith he know that it be hi sword excalibur and say thou hast be from me all too long and much damage hast thou do me and therewith he espy the scabbard hanging by hi side and suddenly he sterte to him and pull the scabbard from him and throw it from him as far a he might throw it o knight say arthur this day hast thou do me great damage with this sword now be ye come unto your death for i shall not warrant you but ye shall as well be reward with this sword or ever we depart a thou hast reward me for much pain have ye make me to endure and much blood have i lose and therewith sir arthur rush on him with all hi might and pull him to the earth and then rush off hi helm and give him such a buffet on the head that the blood come out at hi ear hi nose and hi mouth now will i slay thee say arthur slay me ye may well say accolon an it please you for ye be the best knight that ever i find and i see well that god be with you but for i promise to do this battle say accolon to the uttermost and never to be recreant while i live therefore shall i never yield me with my mouth but god do with my body what he will then sir arthur remember him and think he should have see this knight now tell me say arthur or i will slay thee of what country art thou and of what court sir knight say sir accolon i be of the court of king arthur and my name be accolon of gaul then be arthur more dismayed than he be beforehand for then he remember him of hi sister morgan le fay and of the enchantment of the ship o sir knight say he i pray you tell me who give you this sword and by whom ye have it then sir accolon bethink him and say woe worth this sword for by it have i get my death it may well be say the king now sir say accolon i will tell you this sword hath be in my keep the most part of this twelvemonth and morgan le fay king uriens wife send it me yesterday by a dwarf to this intent that i should slay king arthur her brother for ye shall understand king arthur be the man in the world that she most hateth because he be most of worship and of prowess of any of her blood also she loveth me out of measure a paramour and i her again and if she might bring about to slay arthur by her craft she would slay her husband king uriens lightly and then have she me devise to be king in this land and so to reign and she to be my queen but that be now do say accolon for i be sure of my death well say sir arthur i feel by you ye would have be king in this land it have be great damage to have destroy your lord say arthur it be truth say accolon

to agree and consent to her false lust but i shall be sore avenged upon her an i live that all christendom shall speak of it god knoweth i have honour her and worship her more than all my kin and more

say unto king uriens my sister your wife be alway about to betray me and well i wot either ye or my nephew your son be of counsel with her to have me destroy but a for you say the king to king uriens i deem not greatly that ye be of her counsel for accolon confess to me by hi own mouth that she would have destroy you as well a me therefore i hold you excuse but a for your son sir uwaine i hold him suspect therefore i charge you put him out of my court so sir uwaine be discharge and when sir gawain wist that he make him ready to go with him and say whoso banisheth my cousingermain shall banish me so they two depart and ride into a great forest and so they come to an abbey of monk and there be well lodge but when the king wist that sir gawain be depart from the court there be make great sorrow among all the estate now say gaheris gawain brother we have lose two good knight for the love of one so on the morn they hear their mass in the abbey and so they ride forth till that they come to a great forest then be sir gawain ware in a valley by a turret of twelve fair damosel and two knight arm on great horse and the damosel go to and fro by a tree and then be sir gawain ware how there hang a white shield on that tree and ever a the damosel come by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon the shield then sir gawain and sir uwaine go and salute them and ask why they do that despite to the shield sir say the damosel we shall tell you there be a knight in this country that owneth this white shield and he be a passing good man of hi hand but he hateth all lady and gentlewoman and therefore we do all this despite to the shield i shall say you say sir gawain it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all lady and gentlewoman and peradventure though he hate you he hath some certain cause and peradventure he loveth in some other place lady and gentlewoman and to be love again an he be such a man of prowess a ye speak of now what be hi name sir say they hi name be marhaus the king son of ireland i know him well say sir uwaine he be a passing good knight a any be alive for i saw him once prove at a joust where many knight be gather and that time there might no man withstand him ah say sir gawain damosel methinketh ye be to blame for it be to suppose he that hang that shield there he will not be long therefrom and then may those knight match him on horseback and that be more your worship than thus for i will abide no long to see a knight shield dishonoured and therewith sir uwaine and gawain depart a little from them and then be they ware where sir marhaus come rid on a great horse straight toward them and when the twelve damosel saw sir marhaus they flee into the turret a they be wild so that some of them fell by the way then the one of the knight of the tower dress hi shield and say on high sir marhaus defend thee and so they run together that the knight brake hi spear on marhaus and marhaus smite him so hard that he brake hi neck and the horse back that saw the other knight of the turret and dress him toward marhaus and they meet so eagerly together that the knight of the turret be soon smitten down horse and man stark dead and then sir marhaus ride unto hi shield and saw how it be defouled and say of this despite i be a part avenge but for her love that give me this white shield i shall wear thee and hang mine where thou wast and so he hang it about hi neck then he ride straight unto sir gawain and to sir uwaine and ask them what they do there they answer him that they come from king arthur court to see adventure well say sir marhaus here be i ready an adventurous knight that will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire and so depart from them to fetch hi range let him go say sir uwaine unto sir gawain for he be a passing good knight a any be living i would not by my will that any of u be match with him nay say sir gawain not so it be shame to u be he not assay be he never so good a knight well say sir uwaine i will assay him afore you for i be more weak than ye and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me so these two knight come together with great raundon that sir uwaine smote sir marhaus that hi spear brast in piece on the shield and sir marhaus smite him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth and hurt sir uwaine on the left side then sir marhaus turn hi horse and rode toward gawain with hi spear and when sir gawain saw that he dress hi shield and they aventred their spear and they come together with all the might of their horse that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their shield but sir gawain spear brake but sir marhaus spear hold and therewith sir gawain and hi horse rush down to the earth and lightly sir gawain rise on hi foot and pull out hi sword and dress him toward sir marhaus on foot and sir marhaus saw that and pull out hi sword and begin to come to sir gawain on horseback sir knight say sir gawain alight on foot or els i will slay thy horse gramercy say sir marhaus of your gentleness ye teach me courtesy for it be not for one knight to be on foot and the other on horseback and therewith sir marhaus set hi spear against a tree and alight and tie hi horse to a tree and dress hi shield and either come unto other eagerly and smite together with their sword that their shield fly in cantels and they bruise their helm and their hauberk and wound either other but sir gawain from it pass nine of the clock wax ever strong and strong for then it come to the hour of noon and thrice hi might be increase all this espy sir marhaus and have great wonder how hi might increase and so they wound other pass sore and then when it be past noon and when it draw toward evensong sir gawain strength feebled and wax pass faint that unnethes he might dure any long and sir marhaus be then big and big sir knight say sir marhaus i have well felt that ye be a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might a ever i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrel be not great and therefore it be pity to do you hurt for i feel ye be pass feeble ah say sir gawain gentle knight ye say the word that i should say and therewith they take off their helm and either kiss other and there they swear together either to love other a brother and sir marhaus pray sir gawain to lodge with him that night and so they take their horse and ride toward sir marhaus house and a they ride by the way sir knight say sir gawain i have marvel that so valiant a man a ye be love no lady nor damosel sir say sir marhaus they name me wrongfully those that give me that name but well i wot it be the damosel of the turret that so name me and other such a they be now shall i tell you for what cause i hate them for they be sorceress and enchanter many of them and be a knight never so good of hi body and full of prowess a man may be they will make him a stark coward to have the good of him and this be the principal cause that i hate them and to all good lady and gentlewoman i owe my service a a knight ought to do a the book rehearseth in french there be many knight that overmatched sir gawain for all the thrice might that he have sir launcelot de lake sir tristram sir bors de ganis sir percivale sir pelleas and sir marhaus these six knight have the good of sir gawain then within a little while they come to sir marhaus place which be in a little priory and there they alight and lady and damosel unarm them and hastily look to their hurt for they be all three hurt and so they have all three good lodge with sir marhaus and good cheer for when he wist that they be king arthur sister son he make them all the cheer that lay in hi power and so they sojourn there a sennight and be well ease of their wound and at the last departed now say sir marhaus we will not depart so lightly for i will bring you through the forest and rode day by day well a seven day or they find any adventure at the last they come into a great forest that be name the country and forest of arroy and the country of strange adventure in this country say sir marhaus come never knight since it be christen but he find strange adventure and so they ride and come into a deep valley full of stone and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby be the head of the stream a fair fountain and three damosel sit thereby and then they ride to them and either salute other and the eldest have a garland of gold about her head and she be three score winter of age or more and her hair be white under the garland the second damosel be of thirty winter of age with a circlet of gold about her head the third damosel be but fifteen year of age and a garland of flower about her head when these knight have so behold them they ask them the cause why they sit at that fountain we be here say the damosel for this cause if we may see any errant knight to teach them unto strange adventure and ye be three knight that seek adventure and we be three damosel and therefore each one of you must choose one of u and when ye have do so we will lead you unto three highway and there each of you shall choose a way and hi damosel with him and this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again and god send you your life and thereto ye must plight your troth this be well say say sir marhaus now shall everych of u choose a damosel i shall tell you say sir uwaine i be the young and most weak of you both therefore i will have the eldest damosel for she hath see much and can best help me when i have need for i have most need of help of you both now say sir marhaus i will have the damosel of thirty winter age for she falleth best to me well say sir gawain i thank you for ye have leave me the young and the fairest and she be most liefest to me then every damosel take her knight by the rein of hi bridle and bring him to the three way and there be their oath make to meet at the fountain that day twelvemonth an they be live and so they kiss and depart and each knight set hi lady behind him and sir uwaine take the way that lay west and sir marhaus take the way that lay south and sir gawain take the way that lay north now will we begin at sir gawain that hold that way till that he come unto a fair manor where dwell an old knight and a good householder and there sir gawain ask the knight if he know any adventure in that country i shall show you some tomorn say the old knight and that marvellous so on the morn they ride into the forest of adventure to a laund and thereby they find a cross and a they stand and hove there come by them the fair knight and the seemly man that ever they saw make the great dole that ever man make and then he be ware of sir gawain and salute him and pray god to send him much worship a to that say sir gawain gramercy also i pray to god that he send you honour and worship ah say the knight i may lay that aside for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship and therewith he pass unto the one side of the laund and on the other side saw sir gawain ten knight that hove still and make them ready with their shield and spear against that one knight that come by sir gawain then this one knight aventred a great spear and one of the ten knight encounter with him but this woful knight smote him so hard that he fell over hi horse tail so this same dolorous knight serve them all that at the leastway he smite down horse and man and all he do with one spear and so when they be all ten on foot they go to that one knight and he stand stone still and suffer them to pull him down off hi horse and bound him hand and foot and tie him under the horse belly and so lead him with them o jesu say sir gawain this be a doleful sight to see the yonder knight so to be entreat and it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so for he maketh no resistance no say hi host that be truth for an he would they all be too weak so to do him sir say the damosel unto sir gawain meseemeth it be your worship to help that dolorous knight for methinketh he be one of the best knight that ever i saw i would do for him say sir gawain but it seemeth he will have no help then say the damosel methinketh ye have no lust to help him thus a they talk they saw a knight on the other side of the laund all arm save the head and on the other side there come a dwarf on horseback all arm save the head with a great mouth and a short nose and when the dwarf come nigh he say where be the lady should meet u here and therewithal she come forth out of the wood and then they begin to strive for the lady for the knight say he would have her and the dwarf say he would have her will we do well say the dwarf yonder be a knight at the cross let u put it both upon him and a he deemeth so shall it be i will well say the knight and so they go all three unto sir gawain and tell him wherefore they strive well sir say he will ye put the matter in my hand yea they say both now damosel say sir gawain ye shall stand betwixt them both and whether ye list well to go to he shall have you and when she be set between them both she leave the knight and go to the dwarf and the dwarf take her and go hi way singing and the knight go hi way with great mourn then come there two knight all arm and cry on high sir gawain knight of king arthur make thee ready in all haste and joust with me so they run together that either fell down and then on foot they draw their sword and do full actually the meanwhile the other knight go to the damosel and ask her why she abide with that knight and if ye would abide with me i will be your faithful knight and with you will i be say the damosel for with sir gawain i may not find in mine heart to be with him for now here be one knight discomfit ten knight and at the last he be cowardly lead away and therefore let u two go whilst they fight and sir gawain fought with that other knight long but at the last they accord both and then the knight pray sir gawain to lodge with him that night so a sir gawain go with this knight he ask him what knight be he in this country that smite down the ten knight for when he have do so manfully he suffer them to bind him hand and foot and so lead him away ah say the knight that be the best knight i trow in the world and the most man of prowess and he hath be serve so a he be even more than ten time and hi name hight sir pelleas and he loveth a great lady in this country and her name be ettard and so when he love her there be cry in this country a great joust three day and all the knight of this country be there and gentlewoman and who that prove him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a circlet of gold and the circlet the knight should give it to the fair lady that be at the joust and this knight sir pelleas be the best knight that be there and there be five hundred knight but there be never man that ever sir pelleas meet withal but he strike him down or els from hi horse and every day of three day he strike down twenty knight therefore they give him the prize and forthwith he go thereas the lady ettard be and give her the circlet and say openly she be the fair lady that there be and that would he prove upon any knight that would say nay and so he choose her for hi sovereign lady and never to love other but her but she be so proud that she have scorn of him and say that she would never love him though he would die for her wherefore all lady and gentlewoman have scorn of her that she be so proud for there be fair than she and there be none that be there but an sir pelleas would have proffer them love they would have love him for hi noble prowess and so this knight promise the lady ettard to follow her into this country and never to leave her till she love him and thus he be here the most part nigh her and lodge by a priory and every week she sendeth knight to fight with him and when he hath put them to the bad then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner because he would have a sight of this lady and always she doth him great despite for sometime she maketh her knight to tie him to hi horse tail and some to bind him under the horse belly thus in the most shamefullest way that she can think he be bring to her and all she doth it for to cause him to leave this country and to leave hi love but all this can not make him to leave for an he would have fight on foot he might have have the good of the ten knight as well on foot a on horseback ala say sir gawain it be great pity of him and after this night i will seek him tomorrow in this forest to do him all the help i can so on the morn sir gawain take hi leave of hi host sir carados and ride into the forest and at the last he meet with sir pelleas make great moan out of measure so each of them salute other and ask him why he make such sorrow and a it be above rehearse sir pelleas tell sir gawain but always i suffer her knight to fare so with me a ye saw yesterday in trust at the last to win her love for she knoweth well all her knight should not lightly win me an me list to fight with them to the uttermost wherefore an i love her not so sore i have liefer die an hundred time an i might die so oft rather than i would suffer that despite but i trust she will have pity upon me at the last for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to have hi entent but alas i be unfortunate and therewith he make so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on horseback now say sir gawain leave your mourning and i shall promise you by the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the love of your lady and thereto i will plight you my troth ah say sir pelleas of what court be ye tell me i pray you my good friend and then sir gawain say i be of the court of king arthur and hi sister son and king lot of orkney be my father and my name be sir gawain and then he say my name be sir pelleas bear in the isle and of many isle i be lord and never have i love lady nor damosel till now in an unhappy time and sir knight since ye be so nigh cousin unto king arthur and a king son therefore betray me not but help me for i may never come by her but by some good knight for she be in a strong castle here fast by within this four mile and over all this country she be lady of and so i may never come to her presence but a i suffer her knight to take me and but if i do so that i might have a sight of her i have be dead long or this time and yet fair word have i never of her but when i be brought tofore her she rebuketh me in the foul manner and then they take my horse and harness and put me out of the gate and she will not suffer me to eat nor drink and always i offer me to be her prisoner but that she will not suffer me for i would desire no more what pain so ever i have so that i might have a sight of her daily well say sir gawain all this shall i amend an ye will do a i shall devise i will have your horse and your armour and so will i ride unto her castle and tell her that i have slay you and so shall i come within her to cause her to cherish me and then shall i do my true part that ye shall not fail to have the love of her and therewith sir gawain plight hi troth unto sir pelleas to be true and faithful unto him so each one plight their troth to other and so they change horse and harness and sir gawain depart and come to the castle whereas stand the pavilion of this lady without the gate and as soon a ettard have espy sir gawain she flee in toward the castle sir gawain spake on high and bid her abide for he be not sir pelleas i be another knight that have slay sir pelleas do off your helm say the lady ettard that i may see your visage and so when she saw that it be not sir pelleas she bid him alight and lead him unto her castle and ask him faithfully whether he have slay sir pelleas and he say her yea and tell her hi name be sir gawain of the court of king arthur and hi sister son truly say she that be great pity for he be a passing good knight of hi body but of all men alive i hat him most for i could never be quit of him and for ye have slay him i shall be your woman and to do anything that might please you so she make sir gawain good cheer then sir gawain say that he love a lady and by no mean she would love him she be to blame say ettard an she will not love you for ye that be so well bear a man and such a man of prowess there be no lady in the world too good for you will ye say sir gawain promise me to do all that ye may by the faith of your body to get me the love of my lady yea sir say she and that i promise you by the faith of my body now say sir gawain it be yourself that i love so well therefore i pray you hold your promise i may not choose say the lady ettard but if i should be forswear and so she grant him to fulfil all hi desire so it be then in the month of may that she and sir gawain go out of the castle and sup in a pavilion and there be make a bed and there sir gawain and the lady ettard go to bed together and in another pavilion she lay her damosel and in the third pavilion she lay part of her knight for then she have no dread of sir pelleas and there sir gawain lay with her in that pavilion two day and two night and on the third day in the morning early sir pelleas arm him for he have never sleep since sir gawain depart from him for sir gawain have promise him by the faith of hi body to come to him unto hi pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night then sir pelleas mount upon horseback and come to the pavilion that stand without the castle and find in the first pavilion three knight in three bed and three squire lie at their foot then go he to the second pavilion and find four gentlewoman lie in four bed and then he yede to the third pavilion and find sir gawain lie in bed with hi lady ettard and either clip other in arm and when he saw that hi heart wellnigh brast for sorrow and say ala that ever a knight should be find so false and then he take hi horse and might not abide no long for pure sorrow and when he have ride nigh half a mile he turn again and think to slay them both and when he saw them both so lie sleep fast unnethe he might hold him on horseback for sorrow and say thus to himself though this knight be never so false i will never slay him sleep for i will never destroy the high order of knighthood and therewith he depart again and or he have ride half a mile he return again and think then to slay them both make the great sorrow that ever man make and when he come to the pavilion he tie hi horse unto a tree and pull out hi sword naked in hi hand and go to them thereas they lay and yet he think it be shame to slay them sleep and lay the naked sword overthwart both their throat and so take hi horse and ride hi way and when sir pelleas come to hi pavilion he tell hi knight and hi squire how he have speed and say thus to them for your true and good service ye have do me i shall give you all my good for i will go unto my bed and never arise until i be dead and when that i be dead i charge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her betwixt two silver dish and tell her how i saw her lie with the false knight sir gawain right so sir pelleas unarm himself and go unto hi bed make marvellous dole and sorrow when sir gawain and ettard awoke of their sleep and find the naked sword overthwart their throat then she know well it be sir pelleas sword ala say she to sir gawain ye have betray me and sir pelleas both for ye tell me ye have slay him and now i know well it be not so he be alive and if sir pelleas have be as uncourteous to you a ye have be to him ye have be a dead knight but ye have deceive me and betray me falsely that all lady and damosel may beware by you and me and therewith sir gawain make him ready and go into the forest so it hap then that the damosel of the lake nimue meet with a knight of sir pelleas that go on hi foot in the forest making great dole and she ask him the cause and so the woful knight tell her how hi master and lord be betray through a knight and lady and how he will never arise out of hi bed till he be dead bring me to him say she anon and i will warrant hi life he shall not die for love and she that hath cause him so to love she shall be in as evil plight a he be or it be long to for it be no joy of such a proud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant knight anon that knight bring her unto him and when she saw him lie in hi bed she think she saw never so likely a knight and therewith she throw an enchantment upon him and he fell asleep and therewhile she ride unto the lady ettard and charge no man to awake him till she come again so within two hour she bring the lady ettard thither and both lady find him asleep lo say the damosel of the lake ye ought to be ashamed for to murder such a knight and therewith she throw such an enchantment upon her that she love him sore that wellnigh she be out of her mind o lord jesu say the lady ettard how be it befall unto me that i love now him that i have most hat of any man alive that be the righteous judgment of god say the damosel and then anon sir pelleas awake and look upon ettard and when he saw her he know her and then he hat her more than any woman alive and say away traitress come never in my sight and when she hear him say so she weep and make great sorrow out of measure sir knight pelleas say the damosel of the lake take your horse and come forth with me out of this country and ye shall love a lady that shall love you i will well say sir pelleas for this lady ettard hath do me
