such a make it their business to oversee human action do not find themselves in anything so much perplexed a to reconcile them and bring them into the world eye with the same lustre and reputation for they commonly so strangely contradict one another that it seem impossible they should proceed from one and the same person we find the young marius one while a son of mar and another a son of venus pope boniface viii enter it be say into hi papacy like a fox behave himself in it like a lion and die like a dog and who could believe it to be the same nero the perfect image of all cruelty who have the sentence of a condemned man bring to him to sign a be the custom cry out o that i have never be teach to write so much it go to hi heart to condemn a man to death all story be full of such example and every man be able to produce so many to himself or out of hi own practice or observation that i sometimes wonder to see men of understand give themselves the trouble of sort these piece consider that irresolution appear to me to be the most common and manifest vice of our nature witness the famous verse of the player publius there seem some reason in form a judgment of a man from the most usual method of hi life but consider the natural instability of our manner and opinion i have often think even the best author a little out in so obstinately endeavour to make of u any constant and solid contexture they choose a general air of a man and accord to that interpret all hi action of which if they can not bend some to a uniformity with the rest they be presently impute to dissimulation augustus have escape them for there be in him so apparent sudden and continual variety of action all the whole course of hi life that he have slip away clear and undecided from the most daring critic i can more hardly believe a man constancy than any other virtue and believe nothing sooner than the contrary he that would judge of a man in detail and distinctly bite by bit would oftener be able to speak the truth it be a hard matter from all antiquity to pick out a dozen men who have form their life to one certain and constant course which be the principal design of wisdom for to comprise it all in one word say one of the ancient and to contract all the rule of human life into one it be to will and not to will always one and the same thing i will not vouchsafe say he to add provide the will be just for if it be not just it be impossible it should be always one i have indeed formerly learn that vice be nothing but irregularity and want of measure and therefore ti impossible to fix constancy to it ti a saying of demosthenes that the beginning oh all virtue be consultation and deliberation the end and perfection constancy if we would resolve on any certain course by reason we should pitch upon the best but nobody have think ont our ordinary practice be to follow the inclination of our appetite be it to the left or right upwards or downwards accord a we be waft by the breath of occasion we never meditate what we would have till the instant we have a mind to have it and change like that little creature which receive it colour from what it be lay upon what we but just now propose to ourselves we immediately alter and presently return again to it ti nothing but shift and inconsistency we do not go we be drive like thing that float now leisurely then with violence accord to the gentleness or rapidity of the current every day a new whimsy and our humour keep motion with the time we fluctuate betwixt various inclination we will nothing freely nothing absolutely nothing constantly in any one who have prescribe and establish determinate law and rule in hi head for hi own conduct we should perceive an equality of manner an order and an infallible relation of one thing or action to another shine through hi whole life empedocles observe this discrepancy in the agrigentines that they give themselves up to delight a if every day be their last and build a if they have be to live for ever the judgment would not be hard to make a be very evident in the young cato he who therein have find one step it will lead him to all the rest ti a harmony of very accord sound that can not jar but with u t be quite contrary every particular action require a particular judgment the sure way to steer in my opinion would be to take our measure from the near allied circumstance without engage in a long inquisition or without conclude any other consequence i be tell during the civil disorder of our poor kingdom that a maid hard by the place where i then be have throw herself out of a window to avoid be force by a common soldier who be quarter in the house she be not kill by the fall and therefore repeat her attempt would have cut her own throat have she not be prevent but have nevertheless wound herself to some show of danger she voluntarily confess that the soldier have not a yet importune her otherwise than by courtship earnest solicitation and present but that she be afraid that in the end he would have proceed to violence all which she deliver with such a countenance and accent and withal embrued in her own blood the high testimony of her virtue that she appear another lucretia and yet i have since be very well assure that both before and after she be not so difficult a piece and accord to my host tale in ariosto be a handsome a man and a worthy a gentleman a you will do not conclude too much upon your mistress inviolable chastity for have be repulse you do not know but she may have a good stomach to your muleteer antigonus have take one of hi soldier into a great degree of favour and esteem for hi valour give hi physician strict charge to cure him of a long and inward disease under which he have a great while languish and observe that after hi cure he go much more coldly to work than before he ask him what have so altered and cow him yourself sir reply the other by have ease me of the pain that make me weary of my life lucullus soldier have be rifle by the enemy perform upon them in revenge a brave exploit by which have make himself a gainer lucullus who have conceive a good opinion of him from that action go about to engage him in some enterprise of very great danger with all the plausible persuasion and promise he could think of pray employ answer he some miserable plunder soldier in that affair and flatly refuse to go when we read that mahomet have furiously rat chasan bassa of the janissary because he have see the hungarian break into hi squadron and himself behave very ill in the business and that chasan instead of any other answer rush furiously alone scimitar in hand into the first body of the enemy where he be presently cut to piece we be not to look upon that action peradventure so much a vindication a a turn of mind not so much natural valour a a sudden despite the man you saw yesterday so adventurous and brave you must not think it strange to see him as great a poltroon the next anger necessity company wine or the sound of the trumpet have rouse hi spirit this be no valour form and establish by reason but accidentally create by such circumstance and therefore it be no wonder if by contrary circumstance it appear quite another thing these supple variation and contradiction so manifest in u have give occasion to some to believe that man have two soul other two distinct power that always accompany and incline u the one towards good and the other towards ill accord to their own nature and propension so abrupt a variety not be imaginable to flow from one and the same source for my part the puff of every accident not only carry me along with it accord to it own proclivity but moreover i discompose and trouble myself by the instability of my own posture and whoever will look narrowly into hi own bosom will hardly find himself twice in the same condition i give to my soul sometimes one face and sometimes another accord to the side i turn her to if i speak variously of myself it be because i consider myself variously all the contrariety be there to be find in one corner or another after one fashion or another bashful insolent chaste lustful prate silent laborious delicate ingenious heavy melancholic pleasant lie true know ignorant liberal covetous and prodigal i find all this in myself more or less accord a i turn myself about and whoever will sift himself to the bottom will find in himself and even in hi own judgment this volubility and discordance i have nothing to say of myself entirely simply and solidly without mixture and confusion distinguo be the most universal member of my logic though i always intend to speak well of good thing and rather to interpret such thing a fall out in the best sense than otherwise yet such be the strangeness of our condition that we be often push on to do well even by vice itself if welldoing be not judge by the intention only one gallant action therefore ought not to conclude a man valiant if a man be brave indeed he would be always so and upon all occasion if it be a habit of valour and not a sally it would render a man equally resolute in all accident the same alone a in company the same in list a in a battle for let them say what they will there be not one valour for the pavement and another for the field he would bear a sickness in hi bed as bravely a a wound in the field and no more fear death in hi own house than at an assault we should not then see the same man charge into a breach with a brave assurance and afterwards torment himself like a woman for the loss of a trial at law or the death of a child when be an infamous coward he be firm in the necessity of poverty when he shrink at the sight of a barber razor and rush fearless upon the sword of the enemy the action be commendable not the man many of the greek say cicero can not endure the sight of an enemy and yet be courageous in sickness the cimbrians and celtiberians quite contrary no valour can be more extreme in it kind than that of alexander but it be of but one kind nor full enough throughout nor universal incomparable a it be it have yet some blemish of which hi be so often at hi wit end upon every light suspicion of hi captain conspire against hi life and the carry himself in that inquisition with so much vehemence and indiscreet injustice and with a fear that subvert hi natural reason be one pregnant instance the superstition also with which he be so much tainted carry along with it some image of pusillanimity and the excess of hi penitence for the murder of clytus be also a testimony of the unevenness of hi courage all we perform be no other than a cento a a man may say of several piece and we would acquire honour by a false title virtue can not be follow but for herself and if one sometimes borrow her mask to some other purpose she presently pull it away again tis a vivid and strong tincture which when the soul have once thoroughly imbibe it will not out but with the piece and therefore to make a right judgment of a man we be long and very observingly to follow hi trace if constancy do not there stand firm upon her own proper base if the variety of occurrence make him alter hi pace hi path i mean for the pace may be faster or slow let him go such an one run before the wind avau le dent a the motto of our talebot have it ti no wonder say one of the ancient that chance have so great a dominion over u since it be by chance we live it be not possible for any one who have not design hi life for some certain end it be impossible for any one to arrange the piece who have not the whole form already contrive in hi imagination of what use be colour to him that know not what he be to paint no one lay down a certain design for hi life and we only deliberate thereof by piece the archer ought first to know at what he be to aim and then accommodate hi arm bow string shaft and motion to it our counsel deviate and wander because not level to any determinate end no wind serve him who address hi voyage to no certain port i can not acquiesce in the judgment give by one in the behalf of sophocles who conclude him capable of the management of domestic affair against the accusation of hi son from have read one of hi tragedy neither do i allow of the conjecture of the parians send to regulate the milesians sufficient for such a consequence a they from thence derive come to visit the island they take notice of such ground a be best husband and such countryhouses a be best govern and have take the name of the owner when they have assemble the citizen they appoint these farmer for new governor and magistrate conclude that they who have be so provident in their own private concern would be so of the public too we be all lump and of so various and inform a contexture that every piece play every moment it own game and there be as much difference betwixt u and ourselves a betwixt u and other since ambition can teach man valour temperance and liberality and even justice too see that avarice can inspire the courage of a shopboy breed and nurse up in obscurity and ease with the assurance to expose himself so far from the fireside to the mercy of the wave and angry neptune in a frail boat that she further teach discretion and prudence and that even venus can inflate boy under the discipline of the rod with boldness and resolution and infuse masculine courage into the heart of tender virgin in their mother arm ti not all the understanding have to do simply to judge u by our outward action it must penetrate the very soul and there discover by what spring the motion be guide but that be a high and hazardous undertaking i could wish that few would attempt it the world be nothing but variety and disemblance vice be all alike a they be vice and peradventure the stoic understand them so but although they be equally vice yet they be not all equal vice and he who have transgress the ordinary bound a hundred pace should not be in a bad condition than he that have advance but ten be not to be believe or that sacrilege be not bad than steal a cabbage there be in this a great diversitya in anything whatever the confounding of the order and measure of sin be dangerous murderer traitor and tyrant get too much by it and it be not reasonable they should flatter their conscience because another man be idle lascivious or not assiduous at hi devotion every one overrate the offence of hi companion but extenuate hi own our very instructors themselves rank them sometimes in my opinion very ill a socrates say that the principal office of wisdom be to distinguish good from evil we the best of whom be vicious ought also to say the same of the science of distinguish betwixt vice and vice without which and that very exactly perform the virtuous and the wicked will remain confounded and unrecognised now amongst the rest drunkenness seem to me to be a gross and brutish vice the soul have great part in the rest and there be some vice that have something if a man may so say of generous in them there be vice wherein there be a mixture of knowledge diligence valour prudence dexterity and address this one be totally corporeal and earthly and the rude nation this day in europe be that alone where it be in fashion other vice discompose the understanding this totally overthrow it and render the body stupid the bad state of man be that wherein he lose the knowledge and government of himself and ti say amongst other thing upon this subject that a the must ferment in a vessel work up to the top whatever it have in the bottom so wine in those who have drink beyond measure vent the most inward secret josephus tell u that by give an ambassador the enemy have send to him hi full dose of liquor he worm out hi secret and yet augustus commit the most inward secret of hi affair to lucius piso who conquer thrace never find him faulty in the least no more than tiberias do cossus with whom he intrust hi whole counsel though we know they be both so give to drink that they have often be fain to carry both the one and the other drunk out of the senate and the design of kill caesar be a safely communicate to cimber though he would often be drink a to cassius who drink nothing but water we see our german when drunk a the devil know their post remember the word and keep to their rank i could not have believe there have be so profound senseless and dead a degree of drunkenness have i not read in history that attalus have to put a notable affront upon him invite to supper the same pausanias who upon the very same occasion afterwards kill philip of macedon a king who by hi excellent quality give sufficient testimony of hi education in the house and company of epaminondas make him drink to such a pitch that he could after abandon hi beauty a of a hedge strumpet to the muleteer and servant of the base office in the house and i have be further tell by a lady whom i highly honour and esteem that near bordeaux and about castres where she live a country woman a widow of chaste repute perceiving in herself the first symptom of breed innocently tell her neighbour that if she have a husband she should think herself with child but the cause of suspicion every day more and more increasing and at last grow up to a manifest proof the poor woman be reduce to the necessity of cause it to be proclaim in her parish church that whoever have do that deed and would frankly confess it she do not only promise to forgive but moreover to marry him if he like the motion whereupon a young fellow that serve her in the quality of a labourer encourage by this proclamation declare that he have one holiday find her have take too much of the bottle so fast asleep by the chimney and in so indecent a posture that he could conveniently do hi business without wake her and they yet live together man and wife it be true that antiquity have not much decry this vice the writing even of several philosopher speak very tenderly of it and even amongst the stoic there be some who advise folk to give themselves sometimes the liberty to drink nay to drunkenness to refresh the soul that censor and reprover of other cato be reproach that he be a hard drinker cyrus that so renowned king amongst the other quality by which he claim to be prefer before hi brother artaxerxes urge this excellence that he could drink a great deal more than he and in the best governed nation this trial of skill in drinking be very much in use i have hear silvius an excellent physician of paris say that lest the digestive faculty of the stomach should grow idle it be not amiss once a month to rouse them by this excess and to spur them l they should grow dull and rusty and one author tell u that the persian use to consult about their most important affair after be well warm with wine my taste and constitution be great enemy to this vice than my discourse for besides that i easily submit my belief to the authority of ancient opinion i look upon it indeed a an unmanly and stupid vice but less malicious and hurtful than the other which almost all more directly jostle public society and if we can not please ourselves but it must cost u something a they hold i find this vice cost a man conscience less than the other besides that it be of no difficult preparation nor hard to be find a consideration not altogether to be despise a man well advanced both in dignity and age amongst three principal commodity that he say remain to him of life reckon to me this for one and where would a man more justly find it than amongst the natural convenience but he do not take it right for delicacy and the curious choice of wine be therein to be avoid if you find your pleasure upon drinking of the best you condemn yourself to the penance of drinking of the bad your taste must be more indifferent and free so delicate a palate be not require to make a good toper the german drink almost indifferently of all wine with delight their business be to pour down and not to taste and it so much the good for them their pleasure be so much the more plentiful and nearer at hand secondly to drink after the french fashion but at two meal and then very moderately be to be too spar of the favour of the god there be more time and constancy require than so the ancient spend whole night in this exercise and ofttimes add the day follow to eke it out and therefore we be to take great liberty and stick close to our work i have see a great lord of my time a man of high enterprise and famous success that without set himself tot and after hi ordinary rate of drinking at meal drink not much less than five quart of wine and at hi go away appear but too wise and discreet to the detriment of our affair the pleasure we hold in esteem for the course of our life ought to have a great share of our time dedicate to it we should like shopboys and labourer refuse no occasion nor omit any opportunity of drinking and always have it in our mind methinks we every day abridge and curtail the use of wine and that the after breakfast dinner snatch and collation i use to see in my father house when i be a boy be more usual and frequent then than now be it that we pretend to a reformation truly no but it may be we be more addicted to venus than our father be they be two exercise that thwart and hinder one another in their vigour lechery weaken our stomach on the one side and on the other sobriety render u more spruce and amorous for the exercise of love ti wonderful what strange story i have hear my father tell of the chastity of that age wherein he live it be for him to say it be both by art and nature cut out and finish for the service of lady he speak well and little ever mix hi language with some illustration out of author most in use especially in spanish and among the spanish he whom they call marcus aurelius be ordinarily in hi mouth hi behaviour be gently grave humble and very modest he be very solicitous of neatness and propriety both in hi person and clothes whether on horseback or afoot he be monstrously punctual in hi word and of a conscience and religion generally tend rather towards superstition than otherwise for a man of little stature very strong well proportion and well knit of a pleasing countenance incline to brown and very adroit in all noble exercise i have yet in the house to be see cane pour full of lead with which they say he exercise hi arm for throw the bar or the stone or in fencing and shoe with leaden sol to make him light for run or leaping of hi vaulting he have leave little miracle behind him i have see him when past three score laugh at our exercise and throw himself in hi furred gown into the saddle make the tour of a table upon hi thumb and scarce ever mount the stair into hi chamber without take three or four step at a time but a to what i be speak of before he say there be scarce one woman of quality of ill fame in the whole province he would tell of strange confidence and some of them hi own with virtuous woman free from any manner of suspicion of ill and for hi own part solemnly swear he be a virgin at hi marriage and yet it be after a long practice of arm beyond the mountain of which war he leave u a journal under hi own hand wherein he have give a precise account from point to point of all passage both relate to the public and to himself and he be moreover marry at a well advanced maturity in the year 1528 the threeandthirtieth year of hi age upon hi way home from italy but let u return to our bottle the incommodities of old age that stand in need of some refreshment and support might with reason beget in me a desire of this faculty it be a it be the last pleasure the course of year deprive u of the natural heat say the goodfellows first seat itself in the foot that concern infancy thence it mount into the middle region where it make a long abode and produce in my opinion the sole true pleasure of human life all other pleasure in comparison sleep towards the end like a vapour that still mount upward it arrive at the throat where it make it final residence and conclude the progress i do not nevertheless understand how a man can extend the pleasure of drink beyond thirst and forge in hi imagination an appetite artificial and against nature my stomach would not proceed so far it have enough to do to deal with what it take in for it necessity my constitution be not to care for drink but a follow eating and wash down my meat and for that reason my last draught be always the great and see that in old age we have our palate furred with phlegm or deprave by some other ill constitution the wine taste well to u a the pore be clean washed and lay more open at least i seldom taste the first glass well anacharsis wonder that the greek drank in great glass towards the end of a meal than at the beginning which be i suppose for the same reason the german do the same who then begin the battle of drink plato forbid child wine till eighteen year of age and to get drunk till forty but after forty give them leave to please themselves and to mix a little liberally in their feast the influence of dionysos that good deity who restore to younger men their gaiety and to old men their youth who mollify the passion of the soul a iron be soften by fire and in hi lazes allow such merry meeting provide they have a discreet chief to govern and keep them in order a good and of great utility drunkenness be he say a true and certain trial of every one nature and withal fit to inspire old men with mettle to divert themselves in dance and music thing of great use and that they dare not attempt when sober he moreover say that wine be able to supply the soul with temperance and the body with health nevertheless these restriction in part borrow from the carthaginian please him that men forbear excess in the expedition of war that every judge and magistrate abstain from it when about the administration of hi place or the consultation of the public affair that the day be not to be employ with it that be a time due to other occupation nor the night on which a man intend to get child ti say that the philosopher stilpo when oppress with age purposely hasten hi end by drink pure wine the same thing but not design by him despatch also the philosopher arcesilaus but tis an old and pleasant question whether the soul of a wise man can be overcome by the strength of wine to what vanity do the good opinion we have of ourselves push u the most regular and most perfect soul in the world have but too much to do to keep itself upright and from be overthrow by it own weakness there be not one of a thousand that be right and settle so much a one minute in a whole life and that may not very well doubt whether accord to her natural condition she ever can be but to join constancy to it be her utmost perfection i mean when nothing should jostle and discompose her which a thousand accident may do tis to much purpose that the great poet lucretius keep such a clatter with hi philosophy when behold he go mad with a love philtre be it to be imagine that an apoplexy will not stun socrates as well a a porter some men have forget their own name by the violence of a disease and a slight wound have turn the judgment of other topsyturvy let him be as wise a he will after all he be but a man and than that what be there more frail more miserable or more nothing wisdom do not force our natural disposition he must shut hi eye against the blow that threaten him he must tremble upon the margin of a precipice like a child nature have reserve these light mark of her authority not to be force by our reason and the stoic virtue to teach man hi mortality and our weakness he turn pale with fear red with shame and groan with the cholic if not with desperate outcry at least with hoarse and broken voice the poet that feign all thing at pleasure dare not acquit their great hero of tear ti sufficient for a man to curb and moderate hi inclination for totally to suppress them be not in him to do even our great plutarch that excellent and perfect judge of human action when he see brutus and torquatus kill their child begin to doubt whether virtue could proceed so far and to question whether these person have not rather be stimulate by some other passion all action exceed the ordinary bound be liable to sinister interpretation for as much a our like no more hold with what be above than with what be below it let u leave that other sect that set up an express profession of scornful superiority but when even in that sect repute the most quiet and gentle we hear these rhodomontade of metrodorus when anaxarchus by command of nicocreon the tyrant of cyprus be put into a stone mortar and lay upon with maul of iron cease not to say strike batter break ti not anaxarchus ti but hi sheath that you pound and bray so when we hear our martyr cry out to the tyrant from the middle of the flame this side be roast enough fall to and eat it be enough do fall to work with the other when we hear the child in josephus torn piecemeal with pincer defy antiochus and cry out with a constant and assured voice tyrant thou losest thy labour i be still at ease where be the pain where be the torment with which thou didst so threaten me be this all thou canst do my constancy torment thee more than thy cruelty do me o pitiful coward thou faintest and i grow strong make me complain make me bend make me yield if thou canst encourage thy guard cheer up thy executioner see see they faint and can do no more arm them flesh them anew spur them up truly a man must confess that there be some phrenzy some fury how holy soever that at that time possess those soul when we come to these stoical sally i have rather be mad than voluptuous a saying of antisthenes when sextius tell u he have rather be fetter with affliction than pleasure when epicurus take upon him to play with hi gout and refuse health and ease defies all torment and despise the less pain a disdain to contend with them he covet and call out for other sharper more violent and more worthy of him who but must conclude that these be wild sally push on by a courage that have break loose from it place our soul can not from her own seat reach so high ti necessary she must leave it raise herself up and take the bridle in her teeth transport her man so far that he shall afterwards himself be astonish at what he have do a in war the heat of battle impels generous soldier to perform thing of so infinite danger a afterwards recollect them they themselves be the first to wonder at a it also fare with the poet who be often rapt with admiration of their own writing and know not where again to find the track through which they perform so fine a career which also be in them call fury and rapture and a plato say ti to no purpose for a soberminded man to knock at the door of poesy so aristotle say that no excellent soul be exempt from a mixture of madness and he have reason to call all transport how commendable soever that surpass our own judgment and understanding madness forasmuch a wisdom be a regular government of the soul which be carry on with measure and proportion and for which she be to herself responsible plato argue thus that the faculty of prophesying be so far above u that we must be out of ourselves when we meddle with it and our prudence must either be obstruct by sleep or sickness or lift from her place by some celestial rapture if to philosophise be a ti define to doubt much more to write at random and play the fool a i do ought to be repute doubt for it be for novice and freshman to inquire and to dispute and for the chairman to moderate and determine my moderator be the authority of the divine will that govern u without contradiction and that be seat above these human and vain contestation philip have forcibly enter into peloponnesus and some one say to damidas that the lacedaemonians be likely very much to suffer if they do not in time reconcile themselves to hi favour why you pitiful fellow reply he what can they suffer who do not fear to die it be also ask of agis which way a man might live free why say he by despise death these and a thousand other saying to the same purpose distinctly sound of something more than the patient attend the stroke of death when it shall come for there be several accident in life far bad to suffer than death itself witness the lacedaemonian boy take by antigonus and sell for a slave who be by hi master command to some base employment thou shalt see say the boy whom thou hast buy it would be a shame for me to serve be so near the reach of liberty and have so say threw himself from the top of the house antipater severely threaten the lacedaemonians that he might the good incline them to acquiesce in a certain demand of hi if thou threatenest u with more than death reply they we shall the more willingly die and to philip have write them word that he would frustrate all their enterprise what wilt thou also hinder u from die this be the meaning of the sentence that the wise man live as long a he ought not so long a he can and that the most obliging present nature have make u and which take from u all colour of complaint of our condition be to have deliver into our own custody the key of life she have only order one door into life but a hundred thousand way out we may be straiten for earth to live upon but earth sufficient to die upon can never be want a boiocalus answer the roman why dost thou complain of this world it detain thee not thy own cowardice be the cause if thou liv in pain there need no more to die but to will to die neither be it a recipe for one disease only death be the infallible cure of all tis a most assured port that be never to be fear and very often to be seek it come all to one whether a man give himself hi end or stay to receive it by some other mean whether he pay before hi day or stay till hi day of payment come from whencesoever it come it be still hi in what part soever the thread break theres the end of the clue the most voluntary death be the fine life depend upon the pleasure of other death upon our own we ought not to accommodate ourselves to our own humour in anything so much a in this reputation be not concern in such an enterprise ti folly to be concern by any such apprehension living be slavery if the liberty of die be want the ordinary method of cure be carry on at the expense of life they torment u with caustic incision and amputation of limb they interdict aliment and exhaust our blood one step far and we be cure indeed and effectually why be not the jugular vein a much at our disposal a the median vein for a desperate disease a desperate cure servius the grammarian be torment with the gout could think of no good remedy than to apply poison to hi leg to deprive them of their sense let them be gouty at their will so they be insensible of pain god give u leave enough to go when he be pleased to reduce u to such a condition that to live be far bad than to die ti weakness to truckle under infirmity but it madness to nourish them the stoic say that it be live accord to nature in a wise man to take hi leave of life even in the height of prosperity if he do it opportunely and in a fool to prolong it though he be miserable provide he be not indigent of those thing which they repute to be accord to nature a i do not offend the law against thief when i embezzle my own money and cut my own purse nor that against incendiary when i burn my own wood so be i not under the lash of those make against murderer for have deprive myself of my own life hegesias say that a the condition of life do so the condition of death ought to depend upon our own choice and diogenes meet the philosopher speusippus so blow up with an inveterate dropsy that he be fain to be carry in a litter and by him salute with the compliment i wish you good health no health to thee reply the other who art content to live in such a condition and in fact not long after speusippus weary of so languish a state of life find a mean to die but this do not pass without admit a dispute for many be of opinion that we can not quit this garrison of the world without the express command of him who have place u in it and that it appertain to god who have place u here not for ourselves only but for hi glory and the service of other to dismiss u when it shall best please him and not for u to depart without hi licence that we be not bear for ourselves only but for our country also the law of which require an account from u upon the score of their own interest and have an action of manslaughter good against u and if these fail to take cognisance of the fact we be punish in the other world a deserter of our duty there be more constancy in suffer the chain we be tie to than in break it and more pregnant evidence of fortitude in regulus than in cato ti indiscretion and impatience that push u on to these precipice no accident can make true virtue turn her back she seek and require evils pain and grief a the thing by which she be nourished and support the menace of tyrant rack and torture serve only to animate and rouse her and a another say or a this ti cowardice not virtue to lie squat in a furrow under a tomb to evade the blow of fortune virtue never stop nor go out of her path for the great storm that blow for the most part the fly from other inconvenience bring u to this nay endeavour to evade death we often run into it very mouth like those who from fear of a precipice throw themselves headlong into it plato in hi law assign an ignominious sepulture to him who have deprive hi near and best friend namely himself of life and hi destined course be neither compel so to do by public judgment by any sad and inevitable accident of fortune nor by any insupportable disgrace but merely push on by cowardice and the imbecility of a timorous soul and the opinion that make so little of life be ridiculous for it be our be tis all we have thing of a nobler and more elevated be may indeed reproach ours but it be against nature for u to contemn and make little account of ourselves tis a disease particular to man and not discern in any other creature to hate and despise itself and it be a vanity of the same stamp to desire to be something els than what we be the effect of such a desire do not at all touch u forasmuch a it be contradict and hinder in itself he that desire of a man to be make

excusable incitement i give a it seem to me with good reason the palm to jacques amyot of all our french writer not only for the simplicity and purity of hi language wherein he excel all other nor for hi constancy in go through so long a work nor for the depth of hi knowledge have be able so successfully to smooth and unravel so knotty and intricate an author for let people tell me what they will i understand nothing of greek but i meet with sense so well united and maintain throughout hi whole translation that certainly he either know the true fancy of the author or have by be long conversant with him imprint a vivid and general idea of that of plutarch in hi soul he have deliver u nothing that either derogates from or contradicts him but above all i be the most take with him for have make so discreet a choice of a book so worthy and of so great utility wherewith to present hi country we ignorant fellow have be lose have not this book raise u out of the dirt by this favour of hi we dare now speak and write the lady be able to read to schoolmaster tis our breviary if this good man be yet live i would recommend to him xenophon to do as much by that ti a much more easy task than the other and consequently more proper for hi age and besides though i know not how methinks he do brisklyand clearly enough trip over step another would have stumble at yet nevertheless hi style seem to be more hi own where he do not encounter those difficulty and roll away at hi own ease i be just now read this passage where plutarch say of himself that rusticus be present at a declamation of hi at rome there receive a packet from the emperor and defer to open it till all be do for which say he all the company highly applaud the gravity of this person ti true that be upon the subject of curiosity and of that eager passion for news which make u with so much indiscretion and impatience leave all to entertain a newcomer and without any manner of respect or outcry tear open on a sudden in what company soever the letter that be deliver to u he have reason to applaud the gravity of rusticus upon this occasion and might moreover have add to it the commendation of hi civility and courtesy that would not interrupt the current of hi declamation but i doubt whether any one can commend hi prudence for receive unexpected letter and especially from an emperor it might have fall out that the defer to read them might have be of great prejudice the vice opposite to curiosity be negligence to which i naturally incline and wherein i have see some men so extreme that one might have find letter send them three or four day before still seal up in their pocket i never open any letter direct to another not only those intrust with me but even such a fortune have guide to my hand and be angry with myself if my eye unawares steal any content of letter of importance he be read when i stand near a great man never be man less inquisitive or less pry into other men affair than i in our father day monsieur de boutieres have like to have lose turin from have while engage in good company at supper delayed to read information that be send him of the treason plot against that city where he command and this very plutarch have give me to understand that julius caesar have preserve himself if go to the senate the day he be assassinate by the conspirator he have read a note which be present to him by the way he tell also the story of archias the tyrant of thebe that the night before the execution of the design pelopidas have plot to kill him to restore hi country to liberty he have a full account send him in writing by another archias an athenian of the whole conspiracy and that this packet have be deliver to him while he sit at supper he defer the opening of it say which afterwards turn to a proverb in greece business tomorrow a wise man may i think out of respect to another a not to disturb the company a rusticus do or not to break off another affair of importance in hand defer to read or hear any new thing that be bring him but for hi own interest or particular pleasure especially if he be a public minister that he will not interrupt hi dinner or break hi sleep be inexcusable and there be anciently at rome the consular place a they call it which be the most honourable at the table a be a place of most liberty and of more convenient access to those who come in to speak to the person seat there by which it appear that be at meat they do not totally abandon the concern of other affair and incident but when all be say it be very hard in human action to give so exact a rule upon moral reason that fortune will not therein maintain her own right the sieur de la brousse my brother and i travel one day together during the time of our civil war meet a gentleman of good sort he be of the contrary party though i do not know so much for he pretend otherwise and the mischief ont be that in this sort of war the card be so shuffled your enemy not be distinguish from yourself by any apparent mark either of language or habit and be nourish under the same law air and manner it be very hard to avoid disorder and confusion this make me afraid myself of meet any of our troop in a place where i be not know that i might not be in fear to tell my name and peradventure of something worse a it have befall me before where by such a mistake i lose both men and horse and amongst other an italian gentleman my page whom i breed with the great care and affection be miserably slay in whom a youth of great promise and expectation be extinguish but the gentleman my brother and i meet have so desperate halfdead a fear upon him at meet with any horse or passing by any of the town that hold for the king that i at last discover it to be alarm of conscience it seem to the poor man a if through hi visor and the cross upon hi cassock one would have penetrate into hi bosom and read the most secret intention of hi heart so wonderful be the power of conscience it make u betray accuse and fight against ourselves and for want of other witness to give evidence against ourselves this story be in every child mouth bessus the paeonian be reproach for wantonly pull down a nest of young sparrow and kill them reply that he have reason to do so see that those little bird never cease falsely to accuse him of the murder of hi father this parricide have till then be conceal and unknown but the revenging fury of conscience cause it to be discover by him himself who be to suffer for it hesiod correct the saying of plato that punishment closely follow sin it be a he say bear at the same time with it whoever expect punishment already suffer it and whoever have deserve it expect it wickedness contrive torment against itself a the wasp sting and hurt another but most of all itself for it there lose it sting and it use for ever cantharides have somewhere about them by a contrariety of nature a counterpoison against their poison in like manner at the same time that men take delight in vice there spring in the conscience a displeasure that afflict u sleep and wake with various torment imagination apollodorus dream that he saw himself flay by the scythian and afterwards boil in a cauldron and that hi heart mutter these word i be the cause of all these mischief that have befall thee epicurus say that no hidinghole could conceal the wicked since they could never assure themselves of be hid whilst their conscience discover them to themselves a an ill conscience fill u with fear so a good one give u great confidence and assurance and i can truly say that i have go through several hazard with a more steady pace in consideration of the secret knowledge i have of my own will and the innocence of my intention of this be a thousand example but it will be enough to instance three of one and the same person scipio be one day accuse before the people of rome of some crime of a very high nature instead of excuse himself or flatter hi judge it will become you well say he to sit in judgment upon a head by whose mean you have the power to judge all the world another time all the answer he give to several impeachment bring against him by a tribune of the people instead of make hi defence let u go citizen say he let u go render thanks to the god for the victory they give me over the carthaginian a this day and advance himself before towards the temple he have presently all the assembly and hi very accuser himself follow at hi heel and petilius have be set on by cato to demand an account of the money that have pass through hi hand in the province of antioch scipio be come into the senate to that purpose produce a book from under hi robe wherein he tell them be an exact account of hi receipt and disbursement but be require to deliver it to the prothonotary to be examine he refuse say he would not do himself so great a disgrace and in the presence of the whole senate tear the book with hi own hand to piece i do not believe that the most seared conscience could have counterfeit so great an assurance he have naturally too high a spirit and be accustom to too high a fortune say titius livius to know how to be criminal and to lower himself to the meanness of defend hi innocence the put men to the rack be a dangerous invention and seem to be rather a trial of patience than of truth both he who have the fortitude to endure it conceal the truth and he who have not for why should pain sooner make me confess what really be than force me to say what be not and on the contrary if he who be not guilty of that whereof he be accuse have the courage to undergo those torment why should not he who be guilty have the same so fair a reward a life be in hi prospect i believe the ground of this invention proceeds from the consideration of the force of conscience for to the guilty it seem to assist the rack to make him confess hi fault and to shake hi resolution and on the other side that it fortify the innocent against the torture but when all be do ti in plain truth a trial full of uncertainty and danger what would not a man say what would not a man do to avoid so intolerable torment whence it come to pass that him whom the judge have rack that he may not die innocent he make him die both innocent and rack a thousand and a thousand have charge their own head by false confession amongst whom i place philotas consider the circumstance of the trial alexander put upon him and the progress of hi torture but so it be that some say it be the least evil human weakness could invent very inhumanly notwithstanding and to very little purpose in my opinion many nation less barbarous in this than the greek and roman who call them so repute it horrible and cruel to torment and pull a man to piece for a fault of which they be yet in doubt how can he help your ignorance are not you unjust that not to kill him without cause do bad than kill him and that this be so do but observe how often men prefer to die without reason than undergo this examination more painful than execution itself and that ofttimes by it extremity anticipate execution and perform it i know not where i have this story but it exactly match the conscience of our justice in this particular a countrywoman to a general of a very severe discipline accuse one of hi soldier that he have take from her child the little soup meat she have leave to nourish them withal the army have consume all the rest but of this proof there be none the general after have caution the woman to take good heed to what she say for that she would make herself guilty of a false accusation if she tell a lie and she persist he presently cause the soldier belly to be rip up to clear the truth of the fact and the woman be find to be right an instructive sentence ti not to be expect that argument and instruction though we never so voluntarily surrender our belief to what be read to u should be of force to lead u on so far a to action if we do not over and above exercise and form the soul by experience to the course for which we design it it will otherwise doubtless find itself at a loss when it come to the pinch of the business this be the reason why those amongst the philosopher who be ambitious to attain to a great excellence be not content to await the severity of fortune in the retirement and repose of their own habitation l he should have surprise them raw and inexpert in the combat but sallied out to meet her and purposely throw themselves into the proof of difficulty some of them abandon rich to exercise themselves in a voluntary poverty other seek out labour and an austerity of life to inure them to hardship and inconvenience other have deprive themselves of their dear member a of sight and of the instrument of generation l their too delightful and effeminate service should soften and debauch the stability of their soul but in die which be the great work we have to do practice can give u no assistance at all a man may by custom fortify himself against pain shame necessity and suchlike accident but a to death we can experiment it but once and be all apprentice when we come to it there have anciently be men so excellent manager of their time that they have try even in death itself to relish and taste it and who have bend their utmost faculty of mind to discover what this passage be but they be none of them come back to tell u the news julius canus a noble roman of singular constancy and virtue have be condemn to die by that worthless fellow caligula besides many marvellous testimony that he give of hi resolution a he be just go to receive the stroke of the executioner be ask by a philosopher a friend of hi well canus whereabout be your soul now what be she do what be you think ofi be think reply the other to keep myself ready and the faculty of my mind full settle and fix to try if in this short and quick instant of death i could perceive the motion of the soul when she part from the body and whether she have any sentiment at the separation that i may after come again if i can to acquaint my friend with it this man philosophise not unto death only but in death itself what a strange assurance be this and what bravery of courage to desire hi death should be a lesson to him and to have leisure to think of other thing in so great an affair and yet i fancy there be a certain way of make it familiar to u and in some sort of make trial what it be we may gain experience if not entire and perfect yet such at least a shall not be totally useless to u and that may render u more confident and more assured if we can not overtake it we may approach it and view it and if we do not advance so far a the fort we may at least discover and make ourselves acquaint with the avenue it be not without reason that we be taught to consider sleep a a resemblance of death with how great facility do we pass from wake to sleep and with how little concern do we lose the knowledge of light and of ourselves peradventure the faculty of sleep would seem useless and contrary to nature since it deprive u of all action and sentiment be it not that by it nature instruct u that she have equally make u to die a to live and in life present to u the eternal state she reserve for u after it to accustom u to it and to take from u the fear of it but such a have by violent accident fall into a swoon and in it have lose all sense these methinks have be very near see the true and natural face of death for a to the moment of the passage it be not to be fear that it bring with it any pain or displeasure forasmuch a we can have no feeling without leisure our suffering require time which in death be so short and so precipitous that it must necessarily be insensible they be the approach that we be to fear and these may fall within the limit of experience many thing seem great by imagination than they be in effect i have pass a good part of my life in a perfect and entire health i say not only entire but moreover sprightly and wanton this state so full of verdure jollity and vigour make the consideration of sickness so formidable to me that when i come to experience it i find the attack faint and easy in comparison with what i have apprehend of this i have daily experience if i be under the shelter of a warm room in a stormy and tempestuous night i wonder how people can live abroad and be afflict for those who be out in the field if i be there myself i do not wish to be anywhere els this one thing of be always shut up in a chamber i fancy insupportable but i be presently inure to be so imprison a week nay a month together in a very weak disorder and sad condition and i have find that in the time of my health i much more pitied the sick than i think myself to be pity when i be so and that the force of my imagination enhances near onehalf of the essence and reality of the thing i hope that when i come to die i shall find it the same and that after all it be not worth the pain i take so much preparation and so much assistance a i call in to undergo the stroke but at all event we can not give ourselves too much advantage in the time of our third or second trouble i do not well remember which go one day abroad to take the air about a league from my own house which be seat in the very centre of all the bustle and mischief of the late civil war in france think myself in all security and so near to my retreat that i stand in need of no good equipage i have take a horse that go very easy upon hi pace but be not very strong being upon my return home a sudden occasion fall out to make use of this horse in a kind of service that he be not accustom to one of my train a lusty tall fellow mount upon a strong german horse that have a very ill mouth fresh and vigorous to play the brave and set on ahead of hi fellow come thunder full speed in the very track where i be rush like a colossus upon the little man and the little horse with such a career of strength and weight that he turn u both over and over topsyturvy with our heel in the air so that there lay the horse overthrown and stun with the fall and i ten or twelve pace from him stretch out at length with my face all batter and break my sword which i have have in my hand above ten pace beyond that and my belt break all to piece without motion or sense any more than a stock twas the only swoon i be ever in till that hour in my life those who be with me after have use all the mean they could to bring me to myself conclude me dead take me up in their arm and carry me with very much difficulty home to my house which be about half a french league from thence on the way have be for more than two hour give over for a dead man i begin to move and to fetch my breath for so great abundance of blood be fall into my stomach that nature have need to rouse her force to discharge it they then raise me upon my foot where i throw off a whole bucket of clot of blood a this i do also several time by the way this give me so much ease that i begin to recover a little life but so leisurely and by so small advance that my first sentiment be much nearer the approach of death than life the remembrance of this accident which be very well imprint in my memory so naturally represent to me the image and idea of death have in some sort reconcile me to that untoward adventure when i first begin to open my eye it be with so perplexed so weak and dead a sight that i could yet distinguish nothing but only discern the light a to the function of the soul they advance with the same pace and measure with those of the body i saw myself all bloody my doublet be stain all over with the blood i have vomit the first thought that come into my mind be that i have a harquebus shot in my head and indeed at the time there be a great many fire round about u methought my life but just hung upon my lip and i shut my eye to help methought to thrust it out and take a pleasure in languish and let myself go it be an imagination that only superficially float upon my soul a tender and weak a all the rest but really not only exempt from anything displease but mixed with that sweetness that people feel when they glide into a slumber i believe it be the very same condition those people be in whom we see swoon with weakness in the agony of death we pity them without cause suppose them agitate with grievous dolour or that their soul suffer under painful thought it have ever be my belief contrary to the opinion of many and particularly of la boetie that those whom we see so subdue and stupefy at the approach of their end or oppress with the length of the disease or by accident of an apoplexy or fall sickness or hurt in the head whom we hear to mutter and by fit to utter grievous groan though we gather from these sign by which it seem a if they have some remains of consciousness and that there be movement of the body i have always believe i say both the body and the soul benumb and asleep and could not believe that in so great a stupefaction of the member and so great a defection of the sens the soul could maintain any force within to take cognisance of herself and that therefore they have no torment reflection to make them consider and be sensible of the misery of their condition and consequently be not much to be pity i can for my part think of no state so insupportable and dreadful a to have the soul vivid and afflict without mean to declare itself a one should say of such a be send to execution with their tongue first cut out be it not that in this kind of die the most silent seem to me the most graceful if accompany with a grave and constant countenance or if those miserable prisoner who fall into the hand of the base hangman soldier of this age by whom they be torment with all sort of inhuman usage to compel them to some excessive and impossible ransom keep in the meantime in such condition and place where they have no mean of express or signify their thought and their misery the poet have feign some god who favour the deliverance of such a suffer under a languishing death both the interrupted word and the short and irregular answer one get from them sometimes by bawl and keep a clutter about them or the motion which seem to yield some consent to what we would have them do be no testimony nevertheless that they live an entire life at least so it happen to u in the yawning of sleep before it have fully possess u to perceive a in a dream what be do about u and to follow the last thing that be say with a perplexed and uncertain hearing which seem but to touch upon the border of the soul and to make answer to the last word that have be speak to u which have more in them of chance than sense now see i have in effect try it i have no doubt but i have hitherto make a right judgment for first be in a swoon i labour to rip open the button of my doublet with my nail for my sword be go and yet i felt nothing in my imagination that hurt me for we have many motion in u that do not proceed from our direction so fall people extend their arm before them by a natural impulse which prompt our limb to office and motion without any commission from our reason my stomach be so oppressed with the coagulated blood that my hand move to that part of their own voluntary motion a they frequently do to the part that itch without be direct by our will there be several animal and even men in whom one may perceive the muscle to stir and tremble after they be dead every one experimentally know that there be some member which grow stiff and flag without hi leave now those passion which only touch the outward bark of u can not be say to be ours to make them so there must be a concurrence of the whole man and the pain which be felt by the hand or the foot while we be sleep be none of ours a i draw near my own house where the alarm of my fall be already get before me and my family be come out to meet me with the hubbub usual in such case not only do i make some little answer to some question which be ask me but they moreover tell me that i be sufficiently collect to order them to bring a horse to my wife whom on the road i saw struggle and tire herself which be hilly and rugged this should seem to proceed from a soul it function but it be nothing so with me i know not what i say or do and they be nothing but idle thought in the cloud that be stir up by the sens of the eye and ear and proceed not from me i know not for all that whence i come or whither i go neither be i capable to weigh and consider what be say to me these be light effect that the sens produce of themselves a of custom what the soul contribute be in a dream lightly touch lick and bedew by the soft impression of the sens notwithstanding my condition be in truth very easy and quiet i have no affliction upon me either for other or myself it be an extreme languor and weakness without any manner of pain i saw my own house but know it not when they have put me to bed i find an inexpressible sweetness in that repose for i have be desperately tug and lug by those poor people who have take the pain to carry me upon their arm a very great and a very rough way and have in so do all quite tire out themselves twice or thrice one after another they offer me several remedy but i would take none certainly believe that i be mortally wound in the head and in earnest it have be a very happy death for the weakness of my understanding deprive me of the faculty of discerning and that of my body of the sense of feeling i be suffer myself to glide away so sweetly and after so soft and easy a manner that i scarce find any other action less troublesome than that be but when i come again to myself and to resume my faculty which be two or three hour after i felt myself on a sudden involve in terrible pain have my limb batter and ground with my fall and be so ill for two or three night after that i think i be once more dying again but a more painful death have conclude myself as good a dead before and to this hour be sensible of the bruise of that terrible shock i will not here omit that the last thing i could make them beat into my head be the memory of this accident and i have it over and over again repeat to me whither i be go from whence i come and at what time of the day this mischance befall me before i could comprehend it a to the manner of my fall that be conceal from me in favour to him who have be the occasion and other flimflam be invent but a long time after and the very next day that my memory begin to return and to represent to me the state wherein i be at the instant that i perceive this horse come full drive upon me for i have see him at my heel and give myself for go but this thought have be so sudden that fear have have no leisure to introduce itself it seem to me like a flash of lightning that have pierce my soul and that i come from the other world this long story of so light an accident would appear vain enough be it not for the knowledge i have gain by it for my own use for i do really find that to get acquaint with death need no more but nearly to approach it every one a pliny say be a good doctrine to himself provide he be capable of discover himself near at hand here this be not my doctrine ti my study and be not the lesson of another but my own and if i communicate it it ought not to be ill take for that which be of use to me may also peradventure be useful to another a to the rest i spoil nothing i make use of nothing but my own and if i play the fool ti at my own expense and nobody els be concerned int for ti a folly that will die with me and that no one be to inherit we hear but of two or three of the ancient who have beat this path and yet i can not say if it be after this manner know no more of them but their name no one since have follow the track ti a rugged road more so than it seem to follow a pace so rambling and uncertain a that of the soul to penetrate the dark profundity of it intricate internal winding to choose and lay hold of so many little nimble motion tis a new and extraordinary undertaking and that withdraw u from the common and most recommended employment of the world ti now many year since that my thought have have no other aim and level than myself and that i have only pry into and study myself or if i study any other thing ti to apply it to or rather in myself and yet i do not think it a fault if a other do by other much less profitable science i communicate what i have learn in this though i be not very well pleased with my own progress there be no description so difficult nor doubtless of so great utility a that of a man self and withal a man must curl hi hair and set out and adjust himself to appear in public now i be perpetually trick myself out for i be eternally upon my own description custom have make all speaking of a man self vicious and positively interdict it in hatred to the boasting that seem inseparable from the testimony men give of themselves instead of blow the child nose this be to take hi nose off altogether i think the remedy bad than the disease but allow it to be true that it must of necessity be presumption to entertain people with discourse of one self i ought not pursue my general design to forbear an action that publish this infirmity of mine nor conceal the fault which i not only practise but profess notwithstanding to speak my thought freely i think that the custom of condemn wine because some people will be drunk be itself to be condemn a man can not abuse anything but what be good in itself and i believe that this rule have only regard to the popular vice they be bit for calf with which neither the saint whom we hear speak so highly of themselves nor the philosopher nor the divine will be curb neither will i who be as little the one a the other if they do not write of it expressly at all event when the occasion arise they dont hesitate to put themselves on the public highway of what do socrates treat more largely than of himself to what do he more direct and address the discourse of hi disciple than to speak of themselves not of the lesson in their book but of the essence and motion of their soul we confess ourselves religiously to god and our confessor a our neighbour do to all the people but some will answer that we there speak nothing but accusation against ourselves why then we say all for our very virtue itself be faulty and penetrable my trade and art be to live he that forbid me to speak accord to my own sense experience and practice may as well enjoin an architect not to speak of build accord to hi own knowledge but accord to that of hi neighbour accord to the knowledge of another and not accord to hi own if it be vainglory for a man to publish hi own virtue why do not cicero prefer the eloquence of hortensius and hortensius that of cicero peradventure they mean that i should give testimony of myself by work and effect not barely by word i chiefly paint my thought a subject void of form and incapable of operative production ti all that i can do to couch it in this airy body of the voice the wise and devout men have live in the great care to avoid all apparent effect effect would more speak of fortune than of me they manifest their own office and not mine but uncertainly and by conjecture pattern of some one particular virtue i expose myself entire ti a body where at one view the vein muscle and tendon be apparent every of them in it proper place here the effect of a cold there of the heart beat very dubiously i do not write my own act but myself and my essence i be of opinion that a man must be very cautious how he value himself and equally conscientious to give a true report be it good or worse impartially if i think myself perfectly good and wise i would rattle it out to some purpose to speak less of one self than what one really be be folly not modesty and to take that for current pay which be under a man value be pusillanimity and cowardice accord to aristotle no virtue assist itself with falsehood truth be never matter of error to speak more of one self than be really true be not always mere presumption ti moreover very often folly to be immeasurably pleased with what one be and to fall into an indiscreet selflove be in my opinion the substance of this vice the most sovereign remedy to cure it be to do quite contrary to what these people direct who in forbid men to speak of themselves consequently at the same time interdict thinking of themselves too pride dwell in the thought the tongue can have but a very little share in it they fancy that to think of one self be to be delight with one self to frequent and converse with one self to be overindulgent but this excess spring only in those who take but a superficial view of themselves and dedicate their main inspection to their affair who call it mere reverie and idleness to occupy one self with one self and the building one self up a mere building of castle in the air who look upon themselves a a third person only a stranger if any one be in rapture with hi own knowledge look only on those below him let him but turn hi eye upward towards past age and hi pride will be abate when he shall there find so many thousand wit that trample him under foot if he enter into a flattering presumption of hi personal valour let him but recollect the life of scipio epaminondas so many army so many nation that leave him so far behind them no particular quality can make any man proud that will at the same time put the many other weak and imperfect one he have in the other scale and the nothingness of human condition to make up the weight because socrates have alone digest to purpose the precept of hi god to know himself and by that study arrive at the perfection of set himself at nought he only be repute worthy the title of a sage whosoever shall so know himself let him boldly speak it out they who write the life of augustus caesar observe this in hi military discipline that he be wonderfully liberal of gift to men of merit but that a to the true recompense of honour he be a sparing yet he himself have be gratify by hi uncle with all the military recompense before he have ever be in the field it be a pretty invention and receive into most government of the world to institute certain vain and in themselves valueless distinction to honour and recompense virtue such a the crown of laurel oak and myrtle the particular fashion of some garment the privilege to ride in a coach in the city or at night with a torch some peculiar place assign in public assembly the prerogative of certain additional name and title certain distinction in the bearing of coat of arm and the like the use of which accord to the several humour of nation have be variously receive and yet continue we in france a also several of our neighbour have order of knighthood that be institute only for this end and ti in earnest a very good and profitable custom to find out an acknowledgment for the worth of rare and excellent men and to satisfy them with reward that be not at all chargeable either to prince or people and that which have always be find by ancient experience and which we have heretofore observe among ourselves that men of quality have ever be more jealous of such recompense than of those wherein there be gain and profit be not without very good ground and reason if with the reward which ought to be simply a recompense of honour they should mix other commodity and add rich this mixture instead of procure an increase of estimation would debase and abate it the order of st michael which have be so long in repute amongst u have no great commodity than that it have no communication with any other commodity which produce this effect that formerly there be no office or title whatever to which the gentry pretend with so great desire and affection a they do to that no quality that carry with it more respect and grandeur valour and worth more willingly embrace and with great ambition aspire to a recompense purely it own and rather glorious than profitable for in truth other gift have not so great a dignity of usage by reason they be lay out upon all sort of occasion with money a man pay the wage of a servant the diligence of a courier dance vault speaking and the mean office we receive nay and reward vice with it too a flattery treachery and pimping and therefore ti no wonder if virtue less desire and less willingly receive this common sort of payment than that which be proper and peculiar to her throughout generous and noble augustus have reason to be more sparing of this than the other insomuch that honour be a privilege which derive it principal essence from rarity and so virtue itself we do not intend it for a commendation when we say that such a one be careful in the education of hi child by reason it be a common act how just and well do soever no more than we commend a great tree where the whole forest be the same i do not think that any citizen of sparta glorify himself much upon hi valour it be the universal virtue of the whole nation and as little upon hi fidelity and contempt of rich there be no recompense become virtue how great soever that be once pass into a custom and i know not withal whether we can ever call it great be common see then that these remuneration of honour have no other value and estimation but only this that few people enjoy them ti but to be liberal of them to bring them down to nothing and though there should be now more men find than in former time worthy of our order the estimation of it nevertheless should not be abate nor the honour make cheap and it may easily happen that more may merit it for there be no virtue that so easily spread a that of military valour there be another virtue true perfect and philosophical of which i do not speak and only make use of the word in our common acceptation much great than this and more full which be a force and assurance of the soul equally despise all sort of adverse accident equable uniform and constant of which ours be no more than one little ray use education example and custom can do all in all to the establishment of that whereof i be speak and with great facility render it common a by the experience of our civil war be manifest enough and whoever could at this time unite u all catholic and huguenot into one body and set u upon some brave common enterprise we should again make our ancient military reputation flourish it be most certain that in time past the recompense of this order have not only a regard to valour but have a further prospect it never be the reward of a valiant soldier but of a great captain the science of obey be not repute worthy of so honourable a guerdon there be therein a more universal military expertness require and that comprehend the most and the great quality of a military man a also besides a condition suitable to such a dignity but i say though more men be worthy than formerly yet ought it not to be more liberally distribute and it be good to fall short in not give it at all to whom it should be due than for ever to lose a we have lately do the fruit of so profitable an invention no man of spirit will deign to advantage himself with what be in common with many and such of the present time a have least merit this recompense themselves make the great show of disdain it in order thereby to be rank with those to whom so much wrong have be do by the unworthy conferring and debase the distinction which be their particular right now to expect that in obliterate and abolish this suddenly to create and bring into credit a like institution be not a proper attempt for so licentious and so sick a time a this wherein we now be and it will fall out that the last will from it birth incur the same inconvenience that have ruin the other the rule for dispense this new order have need to be extremely clipt and bound under great restriction to give it authority and this tumultuous season be incapable of such a curb besides that before this can be bring into repute ti necessary that the memory of the first and of the contempt into which it be fall be bury in oblivion this place might naturally enough admit of some discourse upon the consideration of valour and the difference of this virtue from other but plutarch have so often handle this subject i should give myself an unnecessary trouble to repeat what he have say but this be worth consider that our nation place valour vaillance in the high degree of virtue a it very word evidence be derive from valeur and that accord to our use when we say a man of high worth a good man in our court styletis to say a valiant man after the roman way for the general appellation of virtue with them take etymology from vi force the proper sole and essential profession of the french noblesse be that of arm and ti likely that the first virtue that discover itself amongst men and have give to some advantage over other be that by which the strong and most valiant have master the weak and acquire a particular authority and reputation whence come to it that dignify appellation or els that these nation be very warlike give the preeminence to that of the virtue which be most familiar to them just a our passion and the feverish solicitude we have of the chastity of woman occasion that to say a good woman a woman of worth a woman of honour and virtue signifies merely a chaste woman a if to oblige them to that one duty we be indifferent a to all the rest and give them the rein in all other fault whatever to compound for that one of incontinence madam if the strangeness and novelty of my subject which be wont to give value to thing do not save me i shall never come off with honour from this foolish attempt but ti so fantastic and carry a face so unlike the common use that this peradventure may make it pass ti a melancholic humour and consequently a humour very much an enemy to my natural complexion engender by the pensiveness of the solitude into which for some year past i have retire myself that first put into my head this idle fancy of write wherein find myself totally unprovided and empty of other matter i present myself to myself for argument and subject ti the only book in the world of it kind and of a wild and extravagant design there be nothing worth remark in this affair but that extravagancy for in a subject so vain and frivolous the best workman in the world could not have give it a form fit to recommend it to any manner of esteem now madam have to draw my own picture to the life i have omit one important feature have i not therein represent the honour i have ever have for you and your merit which i have purposely choose to say in the beginning of this chapter by reason that amongst the many other excellent quality you be mistress of that of the tender love you have manifest to your child be seat in one of the high place whoever know at what age monsieur destissac your husband leave you a widow the great and honourable match that have since be offer to you as many a to any lady of your condition in france the constancy and steadiness wherewith for so many year you have sustain so many sharp difficulty the burden and conduct of affair which have persecute you in every corner of the kingdom and be not yet weary of torment you and the happy direction you have give to all these by your sole prudence or good fortune will easily conclude with me that we have not so vivid an example a yours of maternal affection in our time i praise god madam that it have be so well employ for the great hope monsieur destissac your son give of himself render sufficient assurance that when he come of age you will reap from him all the obedience and gratitude of a very good man but forasmuch a by reason of hi tender year he have not be capable of take notice of those office of extreme value he have in so great number receive from you i will if these paper shall one day happen to fall into hi hand when i shall neither have mouth nor speech left to deliver it to him that he shall receive from me a true account of those thing which shall be more effectually manifest to him by their own effect by which he will understand that there be not a gentleman in france who stand more indebted to a mother care and that he can not in the future give a good nor more certain testimony of hi own worth and virtue than by acknowledge you for that excellent mother you be if there be any law truly natural that be to say any instinct that be see universally and perpetually imprint in both beast and men which be not without controversy i can say that in my opinion next to the care every animal have of it own preservation and to avoid that which may hurt him the affection that the begetter bear to hi offspring hold the second place in this rank and seeing that nature appear to have recommend it to u have regard to the extension and progression of the successive piece of this machine of hers tis no wonder if on the contrary that of child towards their parent be not so great to which we may add this other aristotelian consideration that he who confer a benefit on any one love him good than he be beloved by him again that he to whom be owe love well than he who owe and that every artificer be fond of hi work than if that work have sense it would be of him by reason that it be dear to u to be and to be consists in movement and action therefore every one have in some sort a be in hi work he who confer a benefit exercise a fine and honest action he who receive it exercise the useful only now the useful be much less lovable than the honest the honest be stable and permanent supply him who have do it with a continual gratification the useful lose itself easily slide away and the memory of it be neither so fresh nor so please those thing be dear to u that have cost u most and give be more chargeable than receive since it have please god to endue u with some capacity of reason to the end we may not like brute be servilely subject and enslave to the law common to both but that we should by judgment and a voluntary liberty apply ourselves to them we ought indeed something to yield to the simple authority of nature but not suffer ourselves to be tyrannically hurry away and transport by her reason alone should have the conduct of our inclination i for my part have a strange disgust for those propensions that be start in u without the mediation and direction of the judgment a upon the subject i be speak of i can not entertain that passion of dandle and caress infant scarcely bear have a yet neither motion of soul nor shape of body distinguishable by which they can render themselves amiable and have not willingly suffer them to be nurse near me a true and regular affection ought to spring and increase with the knowledge they give u of themselves and then if they be worthy of it the natural propension walk hand in hand with reason to cherish them with a truly paternal love and so to judge also if they be otherwise still render ourselves to reason notwithstanding the inclination of nature ti ofttimes quite otherwise and most commonly we find ourselves more take with the run up and down the game and puerile simplicity of our child than we do afterwards with their most complete action a if we have love them for our sport like monkey and not a men and some there be who be very liberal in buy them ball to play withal who be very closehanded for the least necessary expense when they come to age nay it look a if the jealousy of see them appear in and enjoy the world when we be about to leave it render u more niggardly and stingy towards them it vex u that they tread upon our heel a if to solicit u to go out if this be to be fear since the order of thing will have it so that they can not to speak the truth be nor live but at the expense of our be and life we should never meddle with be father at all for my part i think it cruelty and injustice not to receive them into the share and society of our good and not to make them partaker in the intelligence of our domestic affair when they be capable and not to lessen and contract our own expense to make the more room for theirs seeing we beget them to that effect ti unjust that an old fellow broken and half dead should alone in a corner of the chimney enjoy the money that would suffice for the maintenance and advancement of many child and suffer them in the meantime to lose their best year for want of mean to advance themselves in the public service and the knowledge of men a man by this course drive them to despair and to seek out by any mean how unjust or dishonourable soever to provide for their own support a i have in my time see several young men of good extraction so addict to steal that no correction could cure them of it i know one of a very good family to whom at the request of a brother of hi a very honest and brave gentleman i once speak on this account who make answer and confess to me roundly that he have be put upon this paltry practice by the severity and avarice of hi father but that he be now so accustomed to it he could not leave it off and at that very time he be trap steal a lady ring have come into her chamber a she be dress with several other he put me in mind of a story i have hear of another gentleman so perfect and accomplish in this fine trade in hi youth that after he come to hi estate and resolve to give it over he could not hold hi hand nevertheless if he pass by a shop where he saw anything he like from catch it up though it put him to the shame of send afterwards to pay for it and i have myself see several so habituate to this quality that even amongst their comrade they could not forbear filch though with intent to restore what they have take i be a gascon and yet there be no vice i so little understand a that i hate it something more by disposition than i condemn it by reason i do not so much a desire anything of another man this province of ours be in plain truth a little more decried than the other part of the kingdom and yet we have several time see in our time men of good family of other province in the hand of justice convict of abominable theft i fear this vice be in some sort to be attribute to the forementioned vice of the father and if a man should tell me a a lord of very good understanding once do that he hoard up wealth not to extract any other fruit and use from hi parsimony but to make himself honour and seek after by hi relation and that age have deprive him of all other power it be the only remain remedy to maintain hi authority in hi family and to keep him from be neglect and despise by all around in truth not only old age but all other imbecility accord to aristotle be the promoter of avarice that be something but it be physic for a disease that a man should prevent the birth of a father be very miserable who have no other hold on hi children affection than the need they have of hi assistance if that can be call affection he must render himself worthy to be respect by hi virtue and wisdom and beloved by hi kindness and the sweetness of hi manner even the very ash of a rich matter have their value and we be wont to have the bone and relic of worthy men in regard and reverence no old age can be so decrepid in a man who have pass hi life in honour but it must be venerable especially to hi child whose soul he must have train up to their duty by reason not by necessity and the need they have of him nor by harshness and compulsion i condemn all violence in the education of a tender soul that be design for honour and liberty there be i know not what of servile in rigour and constraint and i be of opinion that what be not to be do by reason prudence and address be never to be affect by force i myself be bring up after that manner and they tell me that in all my first age i never felt the rod but twice and then very slightly i practise the same method with my child who all of them die at nurse except leonora my only daughter and who arrive to the age of five year and upward without other correction for her childish fault her mother indulgence easily concur than word only and those very gentle in which kind of proceed though my end and expectation should be both frustrate there be other cause enough to lay the fault on without blame my discipline which i know to be natural and just and i should in this have yet be more religious towards the male a less born to subjection and more free and i should have make it my business to fill their heart with ingenuousness and freedom i have never observe other effect of whip than to render boy more cowardly or more wilfully obstinate do we desire to be beloved of our child will we remove from them all occasion of wish our death though no occasion of so horrid a wish can either be just or excusable let u reasonably accommodate their life with what be in our power in order to this we should not marry so young that our age shall in a manner be confound with theirs for this inconvenience plunge u into many very great difficulty and especially the gentry of the nation who be of a condition wherein they have little to do and who live upon their rent only for elsewhere with people who live by their labour the plurality and company of child be an increase to the common stock they be so many new tool and instrument wherewith to grow rich i marry at threeandthirty year of age and concur in the opinion of thirtyfive which be say to be that of aristotle plato will have nobody marry before thirty but he have reason to laugh at those who undertake the work of marriage after fiveandfifty and condemn their offspring a unworthy of aliment and life thales give the true limit who young and be importune by hi mother to marry answer that it be too soon and be grow into year and urge again that it be too late a man must deny opportunity to every inopportune action the ancient gaul look upon it a a very horrid thing for a man to have society with a woman before he be twenty year of age and strictly recommend to the men who design themselves for war the keep their virginity till well grow in year forasmuch a courage be abate and divert by intercourse with woman muley hassam king of tunis he whom the emperor charles v restore to hi kingdom reproach the memory of hi father mahomet with the frequent of woman style him loose effeminate and a getter of child the greek history observes of iccus the tarentine of chryso astyllus diopompos and other that to keep their body in order for the olympic game and such like exercise they deny themselves during that preparation all commerce with venus in a certain country of the spanish indie men be not permit to marry till after forty age and yet the girl be allow at ten ti not time for a gentleman of thirty year old to give place to hi son who be twenty he be himself in a condition to serve both in the expedition of war and in the court of hi prince have need of all hi appurtenance and yet doubtless he ought to surrender a share but not so great an one a to forget himself for other and for such an one the answer that father have ordinarily in their mouth i will not put off my clothes before i go to bed serf well but a father wear out with age and infirmity and deprive by weakness and want of health of the common society of men wrong himself and hi to amass a great heap of treasure he have live long enough if he be wise to have a mind to strip himself to go to bed not to hi very shirt i confess but to that and a good warm dressinggown the remain pomp of which he have no far use he ought voluntarily to surrender to those to whom by the order of nature they belong ti reason he should refer the use of those thing to them see that nature have reduce him to such a state that he can not enjoy them himself otherwise there be doubtless malice and envy in the case the great act of the emperor charles v be that when in imitation of some of the ancient of hi own quality confess it but reason to strip ourselves when our clothes encumber and grow too heavy for u and to lie down when our leg begin to fail u he resign hi possession grandeur and power to hi son when he find himself fail in vigour and steadiness for the conduct of hi affair suitable with the glory he have therein acquire this fault of not perceive betimes and of not be sensible of the feebleness and extreme alteration that age naturally bring both upon body and mind which in my opinion be equal if indeed the soul have not more than half have lose the reputation of most of the great men in the world i have know in my time and be intimately acquaint with person of great authority whom one might easily discern marvellously lapse from the sufficiency i know they be once endue with by the reputation they have acquire in their former year whom i could heartily for their own sake have wish at home at their ease discharge of their public or military employment which be now grow too heavy for their shoulder i have formerly be very familiar in a gentleman house a widower and very old though healthy and cheerful enough this gentleman have several daughter to marry and a son already of ripe age which bring upon him many visitor and a great expense neither of which well please him not only out of consideration of frugality but yet more for have by reason of hi age enter into a course of life far differ from ours i tell him one day a little boldly a i use to do that he would do good to give u young folk room and to leave hi principal house for he have but that well place and furnish to hi son and himself retire to an estate he have hard by where nobody would trouble hi repose seeing he could not otherwise avoid be importune by u the condition of hi child consider he take my advice afterwards and find an advantage in so do i do not mean that a man should so instal them a not to reserve to himself a liberty to retract i who be now arrive to the age wherein such thing be fit to be do would resign to them the enjoyment of my house and good but with a power of revocation if they should give me cause to alter my mind i would leave to them the use that be no longer convenient for me and of the general authority and power over all would reserve a much asi thought good to myself have always hold that it must needs be a great satisfaction to an age father himself to put hi child into the way of govern hi affair and to have power during hi own life to control their behaviour supply them with instruction and advice from hi own experience and himself to transfer the ancient honour and order of hi house into the hand of those who be to succeed him and by that mean to satisfy himself a to the hope he may conceive of their future conduct and in order to this i would not avoid their company i would observe them near at hand and partake accord to the condition of my age of their feast and jollity if i do not live absolutely amongst them which i could not do without annoy them and their friend by reason of the moros of my age and the restlessness of my infirmity and without violate also the rule and order of living i should then have set down to myself i would at least live near them in some retired part of my house not the best in show but the most commodious nor a i saw some year ago a dean of st hilary of poitier give up to such a solitude that at the time i come into hi chamber it have be two and twenty year that he have not step one foot out of it and yet have all hi motion free and easy and be in good health save a cold that fell upon hi lung he would hardly once in a week suffer any one to come in to see him he always keep himself shut up in hi chamber alone except that a servant bring him once a day something to eat and do then but just come in and go out again hi employment be to walk up and down and read some book for he be a bit of a scholar but a to the rest obstinately bent to die in this retirement a he soon after do i would endeavour by pleasant conversation to create in my child a warm and unfeigned friendship and goodwill towards me which in welldescended nature be not hard to do for if they be furious brute of which this age of ours produce thousand we be then to hate and avoid them a such i be angry at the custom of forbid child to call their father by the name of father and to enjoin them another a more full of respect and reverence a if nature have not sufficiently provide for our authority we call almighty god father and disdain to have our child call u so i have reform this error in my family and ti also folly and injustice to deprive child when grow up of familiarity with their father and to carry a scornful and austere countenance toward them think by that to keep them in awe and obedience for it be a very idle farce that instead of produce the effect design render father distasteful and which be worse ridiculous to their own child they have youth and vigour in possession and consequently the breath and favour of the world and therefore receive these fierce and tyrannical looksmere scarecrow of a man without blood either in hi heart or vein with mockery and contempt though i could make myself fear i have yet much rather make myself beloved there be so many sort of defect in old age so much imbecility and it be so liable to contempt that the best acquisition a man can make be the kindness and affection of hi own family command and fear be no longer hi weapon such an one i have know who have be very imperious in hi youth when he come to be old though he might have live at hi full ease would ever strike rant swear and curse the most violent householder in france fret himself with unnecessary suspicion and vigilance and all this rumble and clutter but to make hi family cheat him the more of hi barn hi kitchen cellar nay and hi very purse too other have the great use and share whilst he keep hi key in hi pocket much more carefully than hi eye whilst he hug himself with the pitiful frugality of a niggard table everything go to rack and ruin in every corner of hi house in play drink all sort of profusion make sport in their junket with hi vain anger and fruitless parsimony every one be a sentinel against him and if by accident any wretched fellow that serve him be of another humour and will not join with the rest he be presently render suspect to him a bait that old age very easily bite at of itself how often have this gentleman boast to me in how great awe he keep hi family and how exact an obedience and reverence they pay him how clearly he saw into hi own affair i do not know any one that can muster more part both natural and acquire proper to maintain dominion than he yet he be fall from it like a child for this reason it be that i have pick out him amongst several other that i know of the same humour for the great example it be matter for a question in the school whether he be well thus or otherwise in hi presence all submit to and bow to him and give so much way to hi vanity that nobody ever resist him he have hi fill of assent of seem fear submission and respect doe he turn away a servant he pack up hi bundle and be go but tis no further than just out of hi sight the step of old age be so slow the sens so troubled that he will live and do hi old office in the same house a year together without be perceive and after a fit interval of time letter be pretend to come from a great way off very humble suppliant and full of promise of amendment by virtue of which he be again receive into favour doe monsieur make any bargain or prepare any despatch that do not please ti suppress and cause afterwards forge to excuse the want of execution in the one or answer in the other no letter be first bring to him he never see any but those that shall seem fit for hi knowledge if by accident they fall first into hi own hand be use to trust somebody to read them to him he read extempore what he think fit and often make such a one ask him pardon who abuse and rail at him in hi letter in short he see nothing but by an image prepared and design beforehand and the most satisfactory they can invent not to rouse and awaken hi ill humour and choler i have see under various aspect enough of these mode of domestic government longenduring constant to the like effect woman be evermore addict to cross their husband they lay hold with both hand on all occasion to contradict and oppose them the first excuse serf for a plenary justification i have see one who rob her husband wholesale that a she tell her confessor she might distribute the more liberal alms let who will trust to that religious dispensation no management of affair seem to them of sufficient dignity if proceed from the husband assent they must usurp it either by insolence or cunning and always injuriously or els it have not the grace and authority they desire when a in the case i be speak of ti against a poor old man and for the child then they make use of this title to serve their passion with glory and a for a common service easily cabal and combine against hi government and dominion if they be male grow up in full and flourish health they presently corrupt either by force or favour steward receiver and all the rout such a have neither wife nor son do not so easily fall into this misfortune but withal more cruelly and unworthily cato the elder in hi time say so many servant so many enemy consider then whether accord to the vast difference between the purity of the age he live in and the corruption of this of ours he do not seem to shew u that wife son and servant be so many enemy to u ti well for old age that it be always accompany by want of observation ignorance and a proneness to be deceive for should we see how we be use and would not acquiesce what would become of u especially in such an age a this where the very judge who be to determine our controversy be usually partisan to the young and interested in the cause in case the discovery of this cheating escape me i can not at least fail to discern that i be very fit to be cheat and can a man ever enough exalt the value of a friend in comparison with these civil tie the very image of it which i see in beast so pure and uncorrupted how religiously do i respect it if other deceive me yet do i not at least deceive myself in think i be able to defend myself from them or in cudgel my brain to make myself so i protect myself from such treason in my own bosom not by an unquiet and tumultuous curiosity but rather by diversion and resolution when i hear talk of any one condition i never trouble myself to think of him i presently turn my eye upon myself to see in what condition i be whatever concern another relates to me the accident that have befall him give me caution and rouse me to turn my defence that way we every day and every hour say thing of another that we might properly say of ourselves could we but apply our observation to our own concern as well a extend it to other and several author have in this manner prejudice their own cause by run headlong upon those they attack and dart those shaft against their enemy that be more properly and with great advantage to be turn upon themselves the late mareschal de montluc have lose hi son who die in the island of madeira in truth a very worthy gentleman and of great expectation do to me amongst hi other regret very much insist upon what a sorrow and heartbreaking it be that he have never make himself familiar with him and by that humour of paternal gravity and grimace to have lose the opportunity of have an insight into and of well know hi son a also of let him know the extreme affection he have for him and the worthy opinion he have of hi virtue that poor boy say he never saw in me other than a stern and disdainful countenance and be go in a belief that i neither know how to love him nor esteem him accord to hi desert for whom do i reserve the discovery of that singular affection i have for him in my soul be it not he himself who ought to have have all the pleasure of it and all the obligation i constrain and rack myself to put on and maintain this vain disguise and have by that mean deprive myself of the pleasure of hi conversation and i doubt in some measure hi affection which could not but be very cold to me have never other from me than austerity nor felt other than a tyrannical manner of proceed i find this complaint to be rational and rightly apprehend for a i myself know by too certain experience there be no so sweet consolation in the loss of friend a the conscience of have have no reserve or secret for them and to have have with them a perfect and entire communication oh my friend be i the good for be sensible of this or be i the bad i be doubtless much the good i be console and honour in the sorrow for hi death be it not a pious and a pleasing office of my life to be always upon my friend obsequies can there be any joy equal to this privation i open myself to my family as much a i can and very willingly let them know the state of my opinion and good will towards them a i do to everybody els i make haste to bring out and present myself to them for i will not have them mistake in me in anything amongst other particular custom of our ancient gaul this a caesar report be one that the son never present themselves before their father nor durst ever appear in their company in public till they begin to bear arm a if they would intimate by this that it be also time for their father to receive them into their familiarity and acquaintance i have observe yet another sort of indiscretion in father of my time that not content with have deprive their child during their own long life of the share they naturally ought to have have in their fortune they afterwards leave to their wife the same authority over their estate and liberty to dispose of them accord to their own fancy and i have know a certain lord one of the principal officer of the crown who have in reversion above fifty thousand crown yearly revenue die necessitous and overwhelmed with debt at above fifty year of age hi mother in her extreme decrepitude be yet in possession of all hi property by the will of hi father who have for hi part live till near fourscore year old this appear to me by no mean reasonable and therefore i think it of very little advantage to a man whose affair be well enough to seek a wife who encumber hi estate with a very great fortune there be no sort of foreign debt that bring more ruin to family than this my predecessor have ever be aware of that danger and provide against it and so have i but those who dissuade u from rich wife for fear they should be less tractable and kind be out in their advice to make a man lose a real commodity for so frivolous a conjecture it cost an unreasonable woman no more to pass over one reason than another they cherish themselves most where they be most wrong injustice allure them a the honour of their virtuous action do the good and the more rich they bring with them they be so much the more goodnatured a woman who be handsome be all the more inclined and proud to be chaste ti reasonable to leave the administration of affair to the mother till the child be old enough accord to law to manage them but the father have bring them up very ill if he can not hope that when they come to maturity they will have more wisdom and ability in the management of affair than hi wife consider the ordinary weakness of the sex it be notwithstanding to say the truth more against nature to make the mother depend upon the discretion of their child they ought to be plentifully provide for to maintain themselves accord to their quality and age by reason that necessity and indigence be much more unbecoming and insupportable to them than to men the son should rather be cut short than the mother in general the most judicious distribution of our good when we come to die be in my opinion to let them be distribute accord to the custom of the country the law have consider the matter good than we know how to do and tis wise to let them fail in their appointment than rashly to run the hazard of miscarry in ours nor be the good properly ours since by civil prescription and without u they be all destine to certain successor and although we have some liberty beyond that yet i think we ought not without great and manifest cause to take away that from one which hi fortune have allot him and to which the public equity give him title and that it be against reason to abuse this liberty in make it serve our own frivolous and private fancy my destiny have be kind to me in not present me with occasion to tempt me and divert my affection from the common and legitimate institution i see many with whom ti time lose to employ a long exercise of good office a word ill take obliterate ten year merit he be happy who be in a position to oil their goodwill at this last passage the last action carry it not the best and most frequent office but the most recent and present do the work these be people that play with their will a with apple or rod to gratify or chastise every action of those who pretend to an interest in their care tis a thing of too great weight and consequence to be so tumbled and tossed and altered every moment and wherein the wise determine once for all have above all thing regard to reason and the public observance we lay these masculine substitution too much to heart propose a ridiculous eternity to our name we be moreover too superstitious in vain conjecture a to the future that we derive from the word and action of child peradventure they might have do me an injustice in dispossess me of my right for have be the most dull and heavy the most slow and unwilling at my book not of all my brother only but of all the boy in the whole province whether about learn my lesson or about any bodily exercise ti a folly to make an election out of the ordinary course upon the credit of these divination wherein we be so often deceive if the ordinary rule of descent be to be violate and the destiny correct in the choice they have make of our heir one might more plausibly do it upon the account of some remarkable and enormous personal deformity a permanent and incorrigible defect and in the opinion of u french who be great admirer of beauty an important prejudice the pleasant dialogue betwixt plato legislator and hi citizen will be an ornament to this place what say they feel themselves about to die may we not dispose of our own to whom we please god what cruelty that it shall not be lawful for u accord a we have be serve and attend in our sickness in our old age in our affair to give more or less to those whom we have find most diligent about u at our own fancy and discretion to which the legislator answer thus my friend who be now without question very soon to die it be hard for you in the condition you be either to know yourselves or what be yours accord to the delphic inscription i who make the law be of opinion that you neither be yourselves your own nor be that yours of which you be possess both your good and you belong to your family a well those past a those to come but further both your family and good much more appertain to the public wherefore l any flatterer in your old age or in your sickness or any passion of your own should unseasonably prevail with you to make an unjust will i shall take care to prevent that inconvenience but have respect both to the universal interest of the city and that of your particular family i shall establish law and make it by good reason appear that private convenience ought to give place to the common benefit go then cheerfully where human necessity call you it be for me who regard no more the one thing than the other and who as much a in me lie be provident of the public interest to have a care a to what you leave behind you to return to my subject it appear to me that woman be very rarely bear to whom the prerogative over men the maternal and natural except be in any sort due unless it be for the punishment of such a in some amorous fever have voluntarily submit themselves to them but that in no way concern the old one of whom we be now speak this consideration it be which have make u so willingly to enact and give force to that law which be never yet see by any one by which woman be exclude the succession to our crown and there be hardly a government in the world where it be not plead a it be here by the probability of reason that authorise it though fortune have give it more credit in some place than in other ti dangerous to leave the disposal of our succession to their judgment accord to the choice they shall make of child which be often fantastic and unjust for the irregular appetite and deprave taste they have during the time of their be with child they have at all other time in the mind we commonly see them fond of the most weak ricketty and deformed child or of those if they have such a be still hang at the breast for not have sufficient force of reason to choose and embrace that which be most worthy they the more willingly suffer themselves to be carry away where the impression of nature be most alone like animal that know their young no long than they give them suck a to the rest it be easy by experience to be discern that this natural affection to which we give so great authority have but very weak root for a very little profit we every day tear their own child out of the mother arm and make them take ours in their room we make them abandon their own to some pitiful nurse to whom we disdain to commit ours or to some shegoat forbid them not only to give them suck what danger soever they run thereby but moreover to take any manner of care of them that they may wholly be occupy with the care of and attendance upon ours and we see in most of them an adulterate affection more vehement than the natural begotten by custom toward the foster child and a great solicitude for the preservation of those they have take charge of than of their own and that which i be say of goat be upon this account that it be ordinary all about where i live to see the countrywoman when they want milk of their own for their child to call goat to their assistance and i have at this hour two manservant that never suck woman milk more than eight day after they be bear these goat be immediately teach to come to suckle the little child know their voice when they cry and come run to them if any other than this fosterchild be present to them they refuse to let it suck and the child in like manner will refuse to suck another goat i saw one the other day from whom they have take away the goat that use to nourish it by reason the father have only borrow it of a neighbour the child would not touch any other they could bring and die doubtless of hunger beast a easily alter and corrupt their natural affection a we i believe that in what herodotus relate of a certain district of lybia there be many mistake he say that the woman be there in common but that the child so soon a it can go find him out in the crowd for hi father to whom he be first lead by hi natural inclination now to consider this simple reason for love our child that we have beget them therefore call them our second self it appear methinks that there be another kind of production proceeding from u that be of no less recommendation for that which we engender by the soul the issue of our understanding courage and ability spring from nobler part than those of the body and that be much more our own we be both father and mother in this generation these cost u a great deal more and bring u more honour if they have anything of good in them for the value of our other child be much more theirs than ours the share we have in them be very little but of these all the beauty all the grace and value be ours and also they more vividly represent u than the other plato add that these be immortal child that immortalise and deify their father a lycurgus solon minos now histories be full of example of the common affection of father to their child it seem not altogether improper to introduce some few of this other kind heliodorus that good bishop of trikka rather choose to lose the dignity profit and devotion of so venerable a prelacy than to lose hi daughter a daughter that continue to this day very graceful and comely but peradventure a little too curiously and wantonly trick and too amorous for an ecclesiastical and sacerdotal daughter there be one labienus at rome a man of great worth and authority and amongst other quality excellent in all sort of literature who be a i take it the son of that great labienus the chief of caesar captain in the war of gaul and who afterwards side with pompey the great so valiantly maintain hi cause till he be by caesar defeat in spain this labienus of whom i be now speak have several enemy envious of hi good quality and ti likely the courtier and minion of the emperor of hi time who be very angry at hi freedom and the paternal humour which he yet retain against tyranny with which it be to be suppose he have tincture hi book and write hi adversary prosecute several piece he have publish before the magistrate at rome and prevail so far against him a to have them condemn to the fire it be in him that this new example of punishment be begin which be afterwards continue against other at rome to punish even write and study with death there would not be mean and matter enough of cruelty do we not mix with them thing that nature have exempt from all sense and suffering a reputation and the product of the mind and do we not communicate corporal punishment to the teaching and monument of the mus now labienus could not suffer this loss nor survive these hi so dear issue and therefore cause himself to be convey and shut up alive in the monument of hi ancestor where he make shift to kill and bury himself at once ti hard to shew a more vehement paternal affection than this cassius severus a man of great eloquence and hi very intimate friend see hi book burn cry out that by the same sentence they should as well condemn him to the fire too see that he carry in hi memory all that they contain the like accident befel cremutius cordus who be accuse of have in hi book commend brutus and cassius that dirty servile and corrupt senate worthy a bad master than tiberius condemn hi writing to the flame he be willing to bear them company and kill himself with fast the good lucan be condemn by that rascal nero at the last gasp of hi life when the great part of hi blood be already spend through the vein of hi arm which he have cause hi physician to open to make him die and when the cold have seize upon all hi extremity and begin to approach hi vital part the last thing he have in hi memory be some of the verse of hi battle of phaysalia which he recite die with them in hi mouth what be this but take a tender and paternal leave of hi child in imitation of the valediction and embrace wherewith we part from ours when we come to die and an effect of that natural inclination that suggest to our remembrance in this extremity those thing which be dear to u during the time of our life can we believe that epicurus who a he say himself die of the intolerable pain of the stone have all hi consolation in the beauty of the doctrine he leave behind him could have receive the same satisfaction from many child though never so wellconditioned and bring up have he have them a he do from the production of so many rich writing or that have it be in hi choice to have leave behind him a deformed and untoward child or a foolish and ridiculous book he or any other man of hi understand would not rather have choose to have run the first misfortune than the other it have be for example peradventure an impiety in st augustin if on the one hand it have be propose to him to bury hi writing from which religion have receive so great fruit or on the other to bury hi child have he have them have he not rather choose to bury hi child and i know not whether i have not much rather have beget a very beautiful one through society with the mus than by lie with my wife to this such a it be what i give it i give absolutely and irrevocably a men do to their bodily child that little i have do for it be no more at my own disposal it may know many thing that be go from me and from me hold that which i have not retain and which as well a a stranger i should borrow thence should i stand in need if i be wiser than my book it be rich than i there be few men addict to poetry who would not be much prouder to be the father to the aeneid than to the handsome youth of rome and who would not much well bear the loss of the one than of the other for accord to aristotle the poet of all artificer be the fond of hi work ti hard to believe that epaminondas who boast that in lieu of all posterity he leave two daughter behind him that would one day do their father honour mean the two victory he obtain over the lacedaemonians would willingly have consent to exchange these for the most beautiful creature of all greece or that alexander or caesar ever wish to be deprive of the grandeur of their glorious exploit in war for the convenience of child and heirs how perfect and accomplish soever nay i make a great question whether phidias or any other excellent sculptor would be so solicitous of the preservation and continuance of hi natural child a he would be of a rare statue which with long labour and study he have perfect accord to art and to those furious and irregular passion that have sometimes inflame father towards their own daughter and mother towards their own son the like be also find in this other sort of parentage witness what be relate of pygmalion who have make the statue of a woman of singular beauty fell so passionately in love with this work of hi that the god in favour of hi passion inspire it with life ti an ill custom and unmanly that the gentleman of our time have get not to put on arm but just upon the point of the most extreme necessity and to lay them by again so soon a ever there be any show of the danger be over hence many disorder arise for every one bustling and run to hi arm just when he should go to charge have hi cuirass to buckle on when hi companion be already put to rout our ancestor be wont to give their headpiece lance and gauntlet to be carry but never put off the other piece so long a there be any work to be do our troop be now cumber and render unsightly with the clutter of baggage and servant who can not be from their master by reason they carry their arm titus livius speaking of our nation many nation do yet and do anciently go to war without defensive arm or with such at least a be of very little proof alexander the most adventurous captain that ever be very seldom wear armour and such amongst u a slight it do not by that much harm to the main concern for if we see some kill for want of it there be few less whom the lumber of arm help to destroy either by be overburthened crush and cramp with their weight by a rude shock or otherwise for in plain truth to observe the weight and thickness of the armour we have now in use it seem a if we only seek to defend ourselves and be rather load than secure by it we have enough to do to support it weight be so manacle and immure a if we be only to contend with our own arm and a if we have not the same obligation to defend them that they have to defend u tacitus give a pleasant description of the menatarms among our ancient gaul who be so arm a only to be able to stand without power to harm or to be harm or to rise again if once strike down lucullus see certain soldier of the medes who form the van of tigranes army heavily arm and very uneasy a if in prison of iron thence conceive hope with great ease to defeat them and by them begin hi charge and victory and now that our musketeer be in credit i believe some invention will be find out to immure u for our safety and to draw u to the war in castle such a those the ancient load their elephant withal this humour be far differ from that of the young scipio who sharply reprehend hi soldier for have plant caltrop under water in a ditch by which those of the town he hold besiege might sally out upon him say that those who assault should think of attack and not to fear suspect with good reason that this stop they have put to the enemy would make themselves less vigilant upon their guard he say also to a young man who show him a fine buckler he have that he be very proud of it be a very fine buckler indeed but a roman soldier ought to repose great confidence in hi right hand than in hi left now tis nothing but the not be use to wear it that make the weight of our armour so intolerable the emperor caracalla be wont to march on foot completely arm at the head of hi army the roman infantry always carry not only a morion a sword and a shield for a to arm say cicero they be so accustomed to have them always on that they be no more trouble to them than their own limb but moreover fifteen day provision together with a certain number of stake wherewith to fortify their camp sixty pound in weight and marius soldier lade at the same rate be inure to march in order of battle five league in five hour and sometimes upon any urgent occasion six their military discipline be much rude than ours and accordingly produce much great effect the young scipio reform hi army in spain order hi soldier to eat standing and nothing that be drest the jeer that be give a lacedaemonian soldier be marvellously pat to this purpose who in an expedition of war be reproach for have be see under the roof of a house they be so inured to hardship that let the weather be what it would it be a shame to be see under any other cover than the roof of heaven we should not march our people very far at that rate a to what remain marcellinus a man breed up in the roman war curiously observe the manner of the parthian arm themselves and the rather for be so different from that of the roman they have say he armour so woven a to have all the scale fall over one another like so many little feather which do nothing hinder the motion of the body and yet be of such resistance that our dart hit upon them would rebound these be the coat of mail our forefather be so constantly wont to use and in another place they have say he strong and able horse cover with thick tan hide of leather and be themselves arm capapie with great plate of iron so artificially order that in all part of the limb which require bend they lend themselves to the motion one would have say that they have be men of iron have armour for the head so neatly fit and so naturally represent the form of a face that they be nowhere vulnerable save at two little round hole that give them a little light correspond with their eye and certain small chink about their nostril through which they with great difficulty breathe ti a description draw very near resemble the equipage of the menatarms in france with their barded horse plutarch say that demetrius cause two complete suit of armour to be make for himself and for alcimus a captain of the great note and authority about him of six score pound weight each whereas the ordinary suit weigh but half a much i make no doubt but that i often happen to speak of thing that be much good and more truly handle by those who be master of the trade you have here purely an essay of my natural part and not of those acquire and whoever shall catch me trip in ignorance will not in any sort get the good of me for i should be very unwilling to become responsible to another for my writing who be not so to myself nor satisfied with them whoever go in quest of knowledge let him fish for it where it be to be find there be nothing i so little profess these be fancy of my own by which i do not pretend to discover thing but to lay open myself they may peradventure one day be know to me or have formerly be accord a fortune have be able to bring me in place where they have be explain but i have utterly forget it and if i be a man of some reading i be a man of no retention so that i can promise no certainty more than to make know to what point the knowledge i now have have rise therefore let none lay stress upon the matter i write but upon my method in write it let them observe in what i borrow if i have know how to choose what be proper to raise or help the invention which be always my own for i make other say for me not before but after me what either for want of language or want of sense i can not myself so well express i do not number my borrowing i weigh them and have i design to raise their value by number i have make them twice a many they be all or within a very few so famed and ancient author that they seem methinks themselves sufficiently to tell who they be without give me the trouble in reason comparison and argument if i transplant any into my own soil and confound them amongst my own i purposely conceal the author to awe the temerity of those precipitate censor who fall upon all sort of writing particularly the late one of men yet live and in the vulgar tongue which put every one into a capacity of criticising and which seem to convict the conception and design a vulgar also i will have them give plutarch a fillip on my nose and rail against seneca when they think they rail at me i must shelter my own weakness under these great reputation i shall love any one that can unplume me that be by clearness of understanding and judgment and by the sole distinction of the force and beauty of the discourse for i who for want of memory be at every turn at a loss to pick them out of their national livery be yet wise enough to know by the measure of my own ability that my soil be incapable of produce any of those rich flower that i there find grow and that all the fruit of my own growth be not worth any one of them for this indeed i hold myself responsible if i get in my own way if there be any vanity and defect in my writing which i do not of myself perceive nor can discern when point out to me by another for many fault escape our eye but the infirmity of judgment consists in not be able to discern them when by another laid open to u knowledge and truth may be in u without judgment and judgment also without them but the confession of ignorance be one of the fine and sure testimony of judgment that i know i have no other officer to put my writing in rank and file but only fortune a thing come into my head i heap them one upon another sometimes they advance in whole body sometimes in single file i would that every one should see my natural and ordinary pace irregular a it be i suffer myself to jog on at my own rate neither be these subject which a man be not permit to be ignorant in or casually and at a venture to discourse of i could wish to have a more perfect knowledge of thing but i will not buy it so dear a it cost my design be to pass over easily and not laboriously the remainder of my life there be nothing that i will cudgel my brain about no not even knowledge of what value soever i seek in the reading of book only to please myself by an honest diversion or if i study ti for no other science than what treat of the knowledge of myself and instructs me how to die and how to live well i do not bite my nail about the difficulty i meet with in my reading after a charge or two i give them over should i insist upon them i should both lose myself and time for i have an impatient understanding that must be satisfy at first what i do not discern at once be by persistence render more obscure i do nothing without gaiety continuation and a too obstinate endeavour darkens stupefies and tire my judgment my sight be confound and dissipate with pore i must withdraw it and refer my discovery to new attempt just a to judge rightly of the lustre of scarlet we be taught to pass the eye lightly over it and again to run it over at several sudden and reiterated glance if one book do not please me i take another and i never meddle with any but at such time a i be weary of do nothing i care not much for new one because the old seem fuller and strong neither do i converse much with greek author because my judgment can not do it work with imperfect intelligence of the material amongst book that be simply pleasant of the modern boccaccio decameron rabelais and the basia of johannes secundus if those may be range under the title be worth read for amusement a to the amadis and such kind of stuff they have not the credit of arrest even my childhood and i will moreover say whether boldly or rashly that this old heavy soul of mine be now no longer tickle with ariosto no nor with the worthy ovid hi facility and invention with which i be formerly so ravished be now of no more relish and i can hardly have the patience to read them i speak my opinion freely of all thing even of those that perhaps exceed my capacity and that i do not conceive to be in any wise under my jurisdiction and accordingly the judgment i deliver be to show the measure of my own sight and not of the thing i make so bold to criticise when i find myself disgust with plato axiochus a with a work with due respect to such an author be it speak without force my judgment do not believe itself it be not so arrogant a to oppose the authority of so many other famous judgment of antiquity which it consider a it tutor and master and with whom it be rather content to err in such a case it condemn itself either to stop at the outward bark not be able to penetrate to the heart or to consider it by sortie false light it be content with only secure itself from trouble and disorder a to it own weakness it frankly acknowledges and confess it it think it give a just interpretation to the appearance by it conception present to it but they be weak and imperfect most of the fable of aesop have diverse sens and meaning of which the mythologist choose some one that quadrates well to the fable but for the most part ti but the first face that present itself and be superficial only there yet remain other more vivid essential and profound into which they have not be able to penetrate and just so tis with me but to pursue the business of this essay i have always think that in poesy virgil lucretius catullus and horace by many degree excel the rest and signally virgil in hi georgics which i look upon a the most accomplished piece in poetry and in comparison of which a man may easily discern that there be some place in hi aeneid to which the author would have give a little more of the file have he have leisure and the fifth book of hi aeneid seem to me the most perfect i also love lucan and willingly read him not so much for hi style a for hi own worth and the truth and solidity of hi opinion and judgment a for good terence the refined elegance and grace of the latin tongue i find him admirable in hi vivid representation of our manner and the movement of the soul our action throw me at every turn upon him and i can not read him so often that i do not still discover some new grace and beauty such a lived near virgil time complain that some should compare lucretius to him i be of opinion that the comparison be in truth very unequal a belief that nevertheless i have much ado to assure myself in when i come upon some excellent passage in lucretius but if they be so angry at this comparison what would they say to the brutish and barbarous stupidity of those who nowadays compare him with ariosto would not ariosto himself say i think the ancient have more reason to be angry with those who compare plautus with terence though much nearer the mark than lucretius with virgil it make much for the estimation and preference of terence that the father of roman eloquence have him so often and alone of hi class in hi mouth and the opinion that the best judge of roman poet have pass upon hi companion i have often observe that those of our time who take upon them to write comedy in imitation of the italian who be happy enough in that way of write take three or four plot of those of plautus or terence to make one of their own and crowd five or six of boccaccio novel into one single comedy that which make them so load themselves with matter be the diffidence they have of be able to support themselves with their own strength they must find out something to lean to and not have of their own stuff wherewith to entertain u they bring in the story to supply the defect of language it be quite otherwise with my author the elegance and perfection of hi way of speaking make u lose the appetite of hi plot hi refined grace and elegance of diction everywhere occupy u he be so pleasant throughout and so possess the soul with hi grace that we forget those of hi fable this same consideration carry me further i observe that the best of the ancient poet have avoid affectation and the hunting after not only fantastic spanish and petrarch elevation but even the soft and more gentle touch which be the ornament of all succeed poesy and yet there be no good judgment that will condemn this in the ancient and that do not incomparably more admire the equal polish and that perpetual sweetness and flourish beauty of catullus epigram than all the sting with which martial arm the tail of hi this be by the same reason that i give before and a martial say of himself the first without be move or without get angry make themselves sufficiently felt they have matter enough of laughter throughout they need not tickle themselves the other have need of foreign assistance a they have the less wit they must have the more body they mount on horseback because they be not able to stand on their own leg a in our ball those mean fellow who teach to dance not be able to represent the presence and dignity of our noblesse be fain to put themselves forward with dangerous jumping and other strange motion and tumbler trick and the lady be less put to it in dance where there be various coupe change and quick motion of body than in some other of a more sedate kind where they be only to move a natural pace and to represent their ordinary grace and presence and so i have see good droll when in their own everyday clothes and with the same face they always wear give u all the pleasure of their art when their apprentice not yet arrive at such a pitch of perfection be fain to meal their face put themselves into ridiculous disguise and make a hundred grotesque face to give u whereat to laugh this conception of mine be nowhere more demonstrable than in compare the aeneid with orlando furioso of which we see the first by dint of wing fly in a brave and lofty place and always follow hi point the latter fluttering and hop from tale to tale a from branch to branch not dare to trust hi wing but in very short flight and perch at every turn l hi breath and strength should fail these then a to this sort of subject be the author that best please me a to what concern my other reading that mix a little more profit with the pleasure and whence i learn how to marshal my opinion and condition the book that serve me to this purpose be plutarch since he have be translate into french and seneca both of these have this notable convenience suit to my humour that the knowledge i there seek be discourse in loose piece that do not require from me any trouble of read long of which i be incapable such be the minor work of the first and the epistle of the latter which be the best and most profiting of all their writing ti no great attempt to take one of them in hand and i give over at pleasure for they have no sequence or dependence upon one another these author for the most part concur in useful and true opinion and there be this parallel betwixt them that fortune bring them into the world about the same century they be both tutor to two roman emperor both seek out from foreign country both rich and both great men their instruction be the cream of philosophy and deliver after a plain and pertinent manner plutarch be more uniform and constant seneca more various and wave the last toiled and bent hi whole strength to fortify virtue against weakness fear and vicious appetite the other seem more to slight their power and to disdain to alter hi pace and to stand upon hi guard plutarch opinion be platonic gentle and accommodate to civil society those of the other be stoical and epicurean more remote from the common use but in my opinion more individually commodious and more firm seneca seem to lean a little to the tyranny of the emperor of hi time and only seem for i take it for certain that he speak against hi judgment when he condemn the action of the generous murderer of caesar plutarch be frank throughout seneca abound with brisk touch and sally plutarch with thing that warm and move you more this content and pay you better he guide u the other push u on a to cicero hi work that be most useful to my design be they that treat of manner and rule of our life but boldly to confess the truth for since one have pass the barrier of impudence there be no bridle hi way of write appear to me negligent and uninviting for hi preface definition division and etymology take up the great part of hi work whatever there be of life and marrow be smother and lose in the long preparation when i have spend an hour in read him which be a great deal for me and try to recollect what i have thence extract of juice and substance for the most part i find nothing but wind for he be not yet come to the argument that serve to hi purpose and to the reason that properly help to form the knot i seek for me who only desire to become more wise not more learned or eloquent these logical and aristotelian disposition of part be of no use i would have a man begin with the main proposition i know well enough what death and pleasure be let no man give himself the trouble to anatomise them to me i look for good and solid reason at the first dash to instruct me how to stand their shock for which purpose neither grammatical subtlety nor the quaint contexture of word and argumentation be of any use at all i be for discourse that give the first charge into the heart of the redoubt hi languish about the subject they be proper for the school for the bar and for the pulpit where we have leisure to nod and may awake a quarter of an hour after time enough to find again the thread of the discourse it be necessary to speak after this manner to judge whom a man have a design to gain over right or wrong to child and common people to whom a man must say all and see what will come of it i would not have an author make it hi business to render me attentive or that he should cry out fifty time oyez a the herald do the roman in their religious exercise begin with hoc age a we in ours do with sursum corda these be so many word lose to me i come already fully prepare from my chamber i need no allurement no invitation no sauce i eat the meat raw so that instead of whet my appetite by these preparatives they tire and pall it will the licence of the time excuse my sacrilegious boldness if i censure the dialog of plato himself a also dull and heavy too much stifle the matter and lament so much time lose by a man who have so many good thing to say in so many long and needless preliminary interlocutions my ignorance will well excuse me in that i understand not greek so well a to discern the beauty of hi language i generally choose book that use science not such a only lead to them the two first and pliny and their like have nothing of this hoc age they will have to do with men already instruct or if they have tis a substantial hoc age and that have a body by itself i also delight in read the epistle to atticus not only because they contain a great deal of the history and affair of hi time but much more because i therein discover much of hi own private humour for i have a singular curiosity a i have say elsewhere to pry into the soul and the natural and true opinion of the author with whom i converse a man may indeed judge of their part but not of their manner nor of themselves by the writing they exhibit upon the theatre of the world i have a thousand times lament the loss of the treatise brutus write upon virtue for it be well to learn the theory from those who best know the practice but see the matter preach and the preacher be different thing i would as willingly see brutus in plutarch a in a book of hi own i would rather choose to be certainly inform of the conference he have in hi tent with some particular friend of hi the night before a battle than of the harangue he make the next day to hi army and of what he do in hi closet and hi chamber than what he do in the public square and in the senate a to cicero i be of the common opinion that learn except he have no great natural excellence he be a good citizen of an affable nature a all fat heavy men such a he be usually be but give to ease and have in truth a mighty share of vanity and ambition neither do i know how to excuse him for think hi poetry fit to be publish ti no great imperfection to make ill verse but it be an imperfection not to be able to judge how unworthy hi verse be of the glory of hi name for what concern hi eloquence that be totally out of all comparison and i believe it will never be equal the young cicero who resemble hi father in nothing but in name whilst command in asia have several stranger one day at hi table and amongst the rest cestius seat at the low end a men often intrude to the open table of the great cicero ask one of hi people who that man be who presently tell him hi name but he a one who have hi thought take up with something els and who have forget the answer make him ask three or four time over and over again the same question the fellow to deliver himself from so many answer and to make him know him by some particular circumstance ti that cestius say he of whom it be tell you that he make no great account of your father eloquence in comparison of hi own at which cicero be suddenly nettle command poor cestius presently to be seize and cause him to be very well whip in hi own presence a very discourteous entertainer yet even amongst those who all thing consider have repute hi eloquence incomparable there have be some who have not stick to observe some fault in it a that great brutus hi friend for example who say twas a broken and feeble eloquence fyactam et elumbem the orator also nearest to the age wherein he live reprehend in him the care he have of a certain long cadence in hi period and particularly take notice of these word ess videatur which he there so often make use of for my part i more approve of a shorter style and that come more roundly off he do though sometimes shuffle hi part more briskly together but tis very seldom i have myself take notice of this one passage the historian be my right ball for they be pleasant and easy and where man in general the knowledge of whom i hunt after appear more vividly and entire than anywhere els the variety and truth of hi internal quality in gross and piecemeal the diversityof mean by which he be united and knit and the accident that threaten him now those that write life by reason they insist more upon counsel than event more upon what sally from within than upon what happen without be the most proper for my reading and therefore above all other plutarch be the man for me i be very sorry we have not a dozen laertii or that he be not far extend for i be equally curious to know the life and fortune of these great instructor of the world a to know the diversityof their doctrine and opinion in this kind of study of history a man must tumble over without distinction all sort of author old and new french or foreign there to know the thing of which they variously treat but caesar in my opinion particularly deserve to be study not for the knowledge of the history only but for himself so great an excellence and perfection he have above all the rest though sallust be one of the number in earnest i read this author with more reverence and respect than be usually allow to human writing one while consider him in hi person by hi action and miraculous greatness and another in the purity and inimitable polish of hi language wherein he not only excel all other historian a cicero confess but peradventure even cicero himself speak of hi enemy with so much sincerity in hi judgment that the false colour with which he strive to palliate hi evil cause and the ordure of hi pestilent ambition except i think there be no fault to be object against him save this that he speak too sparingly of himself see so many great thing could not have be perform under hi conduct but that hi own personal act must necessarily have have a great share in them than he attribute to them i love historian whether of the simple sort or of the high order the simple who have nothing of their own to mix with it and who only make it their business to collect all that come to their knowledge and faithfully to record all thing without choice or discrimination leave to u the entire judgment of discern the truth such for example amongst other be honest froissart who have proceed in hi undertaking with so frank a plainness that have commit an error he be not ashamed to confess and correct it in the place where the finger have be lay and who represent to u even the variety of rumour that be then spread abroad and the different report that be make to him tis the naked and inform matter of history and of which every one may make hi profit accord to hi understand the more excellent sort of historian have judgment to pick out what be most worthy to be know and of two report to examine which be the most likely to be true from the condition of prince and their humour they conclude their counsel and attribute to them word proper for the occasion such have title to assume the authority of regulate our belief to what they themselves believe but certainly this privilege belong to very few for the middle sort of historian of which the most part be they spoil all they will chew our meat for u they take upon them to judge of and consequently to incline the history to their own fancy for if the judgment lean to one side a man can not avoid wrest and writhe hi narrative to that bias they undertake to select thing worthy to be know and yet often conceal from u such a word such a private action a would much well instruct u omit a incredible such thing a they do not understand and peradventure some because they can not express good french or latin let them display their eloquence and intelligence and judge accord to their own fancy but let them withal leave u something to judge of after them and neither alter nor disguise by their abridgment and at their own choice anything of the substance of the matter but deliver it to u pure and entire in all it dimension for the most part and especially in these latter age person be cull out for this work from amongst the common people upon the sole consideration of wellspeaking a if we be to learn grammar from them and the men so choose have fair reason be hire for no other end and pretend to nothing but babble not to be very solicitous of any part but that and so with a fine jingle of word prepare u a pretty contexture of report they pick up in the street the only good history be those that have be write themselves who hold command in the affair whereof they write or who participate in the conduct of them or at least who have have the conduct of other of the same nature such be almost all the greek and roman history for several eyewitness have write of the same subject in the time when grandeur and learn commonly meet in the same person if there happen to be an error it must of necessity be a very slight one and upon a very doubtful incident what can a man expect from a physician who write of war or from a mere scholar treating of the design of prince if we could take notice how scrupulous the roman be in this there would need but this example asinius pollio find in the history of caesar himself something misreported a mistake occasion either by reason he could not have hi eye in all part of hi army at once and have give credit to some individual person who have not deliver him a very true account or els for not have have too perfect notice give him by hi lieutenant of what they have do in hi absence by which we may see whether the inquisition after truth be not very delicate when a man can not believe the report of a battle from the knowledge of him who there command nor from the soldier who be engage in it unless after the method of a judicial inquiry the witness be confront and objection consider upon the proof of the least detail of every incident in good earnest the knowledge we have of our own affair be much more obscure but that have be sufficiently handle by bodin and accord to my own sentiment a little to aid the weakness of my memory so extreme that it have happen to me more than once to take book again into my hand a new and unseen that i have carefully read over a few year before and scribble with my note i have adopt a custom of late to note at the end of every book that be of those i never intend to read again the time when i make an end ont and the judgment i have make of it to the end that this might at least represent to me the character and general idea i have conceive of the author in read it and i will here transcribe some of those annotation i write this some ten year ago in my guicciardini of what language soever my book speak to me in i always speak to them in my own he be a diligent historiographer from whom in my opinion a man may learn the truth of the affair of hi time as exactly a from any other in the most of which he be himself also a personal actor and in honourable command there be no appearance that he disguise anything either upon the account of hatred favour or vanity of which the free censure he pass upon the great one and particularly those by whom he be advanced and employ in command of great trust and honour a pope clement vii give ample testimony a to that part which he think himself the best at namely hi digression and discourse he have indeed some very good and enrich with fine feature but he be too fond of them for to leave nothing unsaid have a subject so full ample almost infinite he degenerate into pedantry and smack a little of scholastic prattle i have also observe this in him that of so many soul and so many effect so many motif and so many counsel a he judge he never attribute any one to virtue religion or conscience a if all these be utterly extinct in the world and of all the action how brave soever in outward show they appear in themselves he always refer the cause and motive to some vicious occasion or some prospect of profit it be impossible to imagine but that amongst such an infinite number of action a he make mention of there must be some one produce by the way of honest reason no corruption could so universally have infect men that some one would not escape the contagion which make me suspect that hi own taste be vicious whence it might happen that he judge other men by himself in my philip de commines there be this write you will here find the language sweet and delightful of a natural simplicity the narration pure with the good faith of the author conspicuous therein free from vanity when speaking of himself and from affection or envy when speaking of other hi discourse and exhortation rather accompany with zeal and truth than with any exquisite sufficiency and throughout authority and gravity which bespeak him a man of good extraction and bring up in great affair upon the memoir of monsieur du bellay i find this ti always pleasant to read thing write by those that have experience how they ought to be carry on but withal it can not be deny but there be a manifest decadence in these two lord from the freedom and liberty of write that shine in the elder historian such a the sire de joinville the familiar companion of st louis eginhard chancellor to charlemagne and of late date philip de commines what we have here be rather an apology for king francis against the emperor charles v than history i will not believe that they have falsify anything a to matter of fact but they make a common practice of twist the judgment of event very often contrary to reason to our advantage and of omit whatsoever be ticklish to be handle in the life of their master witness the proceeding of monsieur de montmorency and de biron which be here omit nay so much a the very name of madame destampes be not here to be find secret action an historian may conceal but to pass over in silence what all the world know and thing that have draw after them public and such high consequence be an inexcusable defect in fine whoever have a mind to have a perfect knowledge of king francis and the event of hi reign let him seek it elsewhere if my advice may prevail the only profit a man can reap from these memoir be in the special narrative of battle and other exploit of war wherein these gentleman be personally engage in some word and private action of the prince of their time and in the treaty and negotiation carry on by the seigneur de langey where there be everywhere thing worthy to be know and discourse above the vulgar strain i fancy virtue to be something els and something more noble than good nature and the mere propension to goodness that we be bear into the world withal welldisposed and welldescended soul pursue indeed the same method and represent in their action the same face that virtue itself do but the word virtue import i know not what more great and active than merely for a man to suffer himself by a happy disposition to be gently and quietly draw to the rule of reason he who by a natural sweetness and facility should despise injury receive would doubtless do a very fine and laudable thing but he who provoke and nettle to the quick by an offence should fortify himself with the arm of reason against the furious appetite of revenge and after a great conflict master hi own passion would certainly do a great deal more the first would do well the latter virtuously one action might be call goodness and the other virtue for methinks the very name of virtue presupposes difficulty and contention and can not be exercise without an opponent ti for this reason perhaps that we call god good mighty liberal and just but we do not call him virtuous be that all hi operation be natural and without endeavour it have be the opinion of many philosopher not only stoic but epicurean i borrow from the vulgar opinion which be false notwithstanding the witty conceit of arcesilaus in answer to one who be reproach that many scholar go from hi school to the epicurean but never any from thence to hi school say in answer i believe it indeed number of capon be make out of cock but never any cock out of capon for in truth the epicurean sect be not at all inferior to the stoic in steadiness and the rigour of opinion and precept and a certain stoic show more honesty than those disputant who in order to quarrel with epicurus and to throw the game into their hand make him say what he never think put a wrong construction upon hi word clothe hi sentence by the strict rule of grammar with another meaning and a different opinion from that which they know he entertain in hi mind and in hi moral the stoic i say declare that he abandon the epicurean sect upon this among other consideration that he think their road too lofty and inaccessible these philosopher say that it be not enough to have the soul seat in a good place of a good temper and well dispose to virtue it be not enough to have our resolution and our reason fix above all the power of fortune but that we be moreover to seek occasion wherein to put them to the proof they would seek pain necessity and contempt to contend with them and to keep the soul in breath ti one of the reason why epaminondas who be yet of a third sect refuse the rich fortune present to him by very lawful mean because say he i be to contend with poverty in which extreme he maintain himself to the last socrates put himself methinks upon a ruder trial keep for hi exercise a confounded scolding wife which be fight at sharp metellus have of all the roman senator alone attempt by the power of virtue to withstand the violence of saturninus tribune of the people at rome who would by all mean cause an unjust law to pass in favour of the common and by so do have incur the capital penalty that saturninus have establish against the dissentient entertain those who in this extremity lead him to execution with word to this effect that it be a thing too easy and too base to do ill and that to do well where there be no danger be a common thing but that to do well where there be danger be the proper office of a man of virtue these word of metellus very clearly represent to u what i would make out viz that virtue refuse facility for a companion and that the easy smooth and descend way by which the regular step of a sweet disposition of nature be conduct be not that of a true virtue she require a rough and stormy passage she will have either exotic difficulty to wrestle with like that of metellus by mean whereof fortune delight to interrupt the speed of her career or internal difficulty that the inordinate appetite and imperfection of our condition introduce to disturb her i be come thus far at my ease but here it come into my head that the soul of socrates the most perfect that ever come to my knowledge should by this rule be of very little recommendation for i can not conceive in that person any the least motion of a vicious inclination i can not imagine there could be any difficulty or constraint in the course of hi virtue i know hi reason to be so powerful and sovereign over him that she would never have suffer a vicious appetite so much a to spring in him to a virtue so elevate a hi i have nothing to oppose methinks i see him march with a victorious and triumphant pace in pomp and at hi ease without opposition or disturbance if virtue can not shine bright but by the conflict of contrary appetite shall we then say that she can not subsist without the assistance of vice and that it be from her that she derive her reputation and honour what then also would become of that brave and generous epicurean pleasure which make account that it nourish virtue tenderly in her lap and there make it play and wanton give it for toy to play withal shame fever poverty death and torment if i presuppose that a perfect virtue manifest itself in contend in patient enduring of pain and undergo the uttermost extremity of the gout without be move in her seat if i give her trouble and difficulty for her necessary object what will become of a virtue elevate to such a degree a not only to despise pain but moreover to rejoice in it and to be tickle with the throe of a sharp colic such a the epicurean have establish and of which many of them by their action have give most manifest proof a have several other who i find to have surpass in effect even the very rule of their discipline witness the young cato when i see him die and tear out hi own bowel i be not satisfy simply to believe that he have then hi soul totally exempt from all trouble and horror i can not think that he only maintain himself in the steadiness that the stoical rule prescribe him temperate without emotion and imperturbed there be methinks something in the virtue of this man too sprightly and fresh to stop there i believe that without doubt he felt a pleasure and delight in so noble an action and be more pleased in it than in any other of hi life i believe it so thoroughly that i question whether he would have be content to have be deprive of the occasion of so brave an exploit and if the goodness that make him embrace the public concern more than hi own withheld me not i should easily fall into an opinion that he think himself oblige to fortune for have put hi virtue upon so brave a trial and for have favour that theifcaesarin tread underfoot the ancient liberty of hi country methinks i read in this action i know not what exaltation in hi soul and an extraordinary and manly emotion of pleasure when he look upon the generosity and height of hi enterprise not stimulate with any hope of glory a the popular and effeminate judgment of some have conclude for that consideration be too mean and low to possess so generous so haughty and so determine a heart a hi but for the very beauty of the thing in itself which he who have the handling of the spring discern more clearly and in it perfection than we be able to do philosophy have oblige me in determine that so brave an action have be indecently place in any other life than that of cato and that it only appertain to hi to end so notwithstanding and accord to reason he command hi son and the senator who accompany him to take another course in their affair every death ought to hold proportion with the life before it we do not become other for die i always interpret the death by the life preceding and if any one tell me of a death strong and constant in appearance annexed to a feeble life i conclude it produce by some feeble cause and suitable to the life before the easiness then of hi death and the facility of die he have acquire by the vigour of hi soul shall we say that it ought to abate anything of the lustre of hi virtue and who that have hi brain never so little tinctured with the true philosophy can be content to imagine socrates only free from fear and passion in the accident of hi prison fetter and condemnation and that will not discover in him not only firmness and constancy which be hi ordinary condition but moreover i know not what new satisfaction and a frolic cheerfulness in hi last word and action in the start he give with the pleasure of scratch hi leg when hi iron be take off do he not discover an equal serenity and joy in hi soul for be free from past inconvenience and at the same time to enter into the knowledge of the thing to come cato shall pardon me if he please hi death indeed be more tragical and more lingering but yet this be i know not how methinks finer aristippus to one that be lament this death the god grant me such an one say he a man discern in the soul of these two great men and their imitator for i very much doubt whether there be ever their equal so perfect a habitude to virtue that it be turn to a complexion it be no longer a laborious virtue nor the precept of reason to maintain which the soul be so racked but the very essence of their soul it natural and ordinary habit they have render it such by a long practice of philosophical precept have light upon a rich and fine nature the vicious passion that spring in u can find no entrance into them the force and vigour of their soul stifle and extinguish irregular desire so soon a they begin to move now that it be not more noble by a high and divine resolution to hinder the birth of temptation and to be so form to virtue that the very seed of vice be root out than to hinder by main force their progress and have suffer ourselves to be surprise with the first motion of the passion to arm ourselves and to stand firm to oppose their progress and overcome them and that this second effect be not also much more generous than to be simply endow with a facile and affable nature of itself disaffect to debauchery and vice i do not think can be doubt for this third and last sort of virtue seem to render a man innocent but not virtuous free from do ill but not apt enough to do well consider also that this condition be so near neighbour to imperfection and cowardice that i know not very well how to separate the confines and distinguish them the very name of goodness and innocence be for this reason in some sort grow into contempt i very well know that several virtue a chastity sobriety and temperance may come to a man through personal defect constancy in danger if it must be so call the contempt of death and patience in misfortune may ofttimes be find in men for want of well judge of such accident and not apprehend them for such a they be want of apprehension and stupidity sometimes counterfeit virtuous effect a i have often see it happen that men have be commend for what really merit blame an italian lord once say this in my presence to the disadvantage of hi own nation that the subtlety of the italian and the vivacity of their conception be so great and they foresee the danger and accident that might befall them so far off that it be not to be think strange if they be often in war observe to provide for their safety even before they have discover the peril that we french and the spaniard who be not so cunning go on further and that we must be make to see and feel the danger before we would take the alarm but that even then we could not stick to it but the german and swiss more gross and heavy have not the sense to look about them even when the blow be fall about their ear peradventure he only talk so for mirth sake and yet it be most certain that in war raw soldier rush into danger with more precipitancy than after they have be cudgel for this reason it be that when we judge of a particular action we be to consider the circumstance and the whole man by whom it be perform before we give it a name to instance in myself i have sometimes know my friend call that prudence in me which be merely fortune and repute that courage and patience which be judgment and opinion and attribute to me one title for another sometimes to my advantage and sometimes otherwise a to the rest i be so far from be arrive at the first and most perfect degree of excellence where virtue be turn into habit that even of the second i have make no great proof i have not be very solicitous to curb the desire by which i have be importune my virtue be a virtue or rather an innocence casual and accidental if i have be bear of a more irregular complexion i be afraid i should have make scurvy work for i never observe any great stability in my soul to resist passion if they be never so little vehement i know not how to nourish quarrel and debate in my own bosom and consequently owe myself no great thanks that i be free from several vice i owe it rather to my fortune than my reason she have cause me to be descend of a race famous for integrity and of a very good father i know not whether or no he have infuse into me part of hi humour or whether domestic example and the good education of my infancy have insensibly assist in the work or if i be otherwise bear so but so it be that i have naturally a horror for most vice the answer of antisthenes to him who ask him which be the best apprenticeship to unlearn evil seem to point at this i have them in horror i say with a detestation so natural and so much my own that the same instinct and impression i bring of them with me from my nurse i yet retain and no temptation whatever have have the power to make me alter it not so much a my own discourse which in some thing lash out of the common road might seem easily to license me to action that my natural inclination make me hate i will say a prodigious thing but i will say it however i find myself in many thing more under reputation by my manner than by my opinion and my concupiscence less debauch than my reason aristippus institute opinion so bold in favour of pleasure and rich a set all the philosopher against him but a to hi manner dionysius the tyrant have present three beautiful woman before him to take hi choice he make answer that he would choose them all and that paris get himself into trouble for have prefer one before the other two but have take them home to hi house he send them back untouched hi servant finding himself overladen upon the way with the money he carry after him he order him to pour out and throw away that which trouble him and epicurus whose doctrine be so irreligious and effeminate be in hi life very laborious and devout he write to a friend of hi that he live only upon biscuit and water entreat him to send him a little cheese to lie by him against he have a mind to make a feast must it be true that to be a perfect good man we must be so by an occult natural and universal propriety without law reason or example the debauch wherein i have be engage have not be i thank god of the bad sort and i have condemn them in myself for my judgment be never infect by them on the contrary i accuse them more severely in myself than in any other but that be all for a to the rest i oppose too little resistance and suffer myself to incline too much to the other side of the balance except that i moderate them and prevent them from mix with other vice which for the most part will cling together if a man have not a care i have contract and curtail mine to make them a single and as simple a i can for as to the opinion of the stoic who say that the wise man when he work work by all the virtue together though one be most apparent accord to the nature of the action and herein the similitude of a human body might serve them somewhat for the action of anger can not work unless all the humour assist it though choler predominate if they will thence draw a like consequence that when the wicked man do wickedly he do it by all the vice together i do not believe it to be so or els i understand them not for i by effect find the contrary these be sharp unsubstantial subleties with which philosophy sometimes amuse itself i follow some vice but i fly other as much a a saint would do the peripatetic also disown this indissoluble connection and aristotle be of opinion that a prudent and just man may be intemperate and inconsistent socrates confess to some who have discover a certain inclination to vice in hi physiognomy that it be in truth hi natural propension but that he have by discipline correct it and such a be familiar with the philosopher stilpo say that be bear with addiction to wine and woman he have by study render himself very abstinent both from the one and the other what i have in me of good i have quite contrary by the chance of my birth and hold it not either by law precept or any other instruction the innocence that be in me be a simple one little vigour and no art amongst other vice i mortally hate cruelty both by nature and judgment a the very extreme of all vice nay with so much tenderness that i can not see a chicken neck pull off without trouble and can not without impatience endure the cry of a hare in my dog teeth though the chase be a violent pleasure such a have sensuality to encounter freely make use of this argument to shew that it be altogether vicious and unreasonable that when it be at the height it master u to that degree that a man reason can have no access and instance our own experience in the act of love wherein they conceive that the pleasure so transport u that our reason can not perform it office whilst we be in such ecstasy and rapture i know very well it may be otherwise and that a man may sometimes if he will gain this point over himself to sway hi soul even in the critical moment to think of something els but then he must ply it to that bent i know that a man may triumph over the utmost effort of this pleasure i have experience it in myself and have not find venus so imperious a goddess a many and much more virtuous men than i declare i do not consider it a miracle a the queen of navarre do in one of the tale of her heptameron which be a very pretty book of it kind nor for a thing of extreme difficulty to pass whole night where a man have all the convenience and liberty he can desire with a longcoveted mistress and yet be true to the pledge first give to satisfy himself with kiss and suchlike endearment without press any further i conceive that the example of the pleasure of the chase would be more proper wherein though the pleasure be less there be the high excitement of unexpected joy give no time for the reason take by surprise to prepare itself for the encounter when after a long quest the beast start up on a sudden in a place where peradventure we least expect it the shock and the ardour of the shout and cry of the hunter so strike u that it would be hard for those who love this less chase to turn their thought upon the instant another way and the poet make diana triumph over the torch and shaft of cupid to return to what i be say before i be tenderly compassionate of other affliction and should readily cry for company if upon any occasion whatever i could cry at all nothing tempts my tear but tear and not only those that be real and true but whatever they be feign or paint i do not much lament the dead and should envy them rather but i very much lament the die the savage do not so much offend me in roast and eat the body of the dead a they do who torment and persecute the living nay i can not look so much a upon the ordinary execution of justice how reasonable soever with a steady eye some one have to give testimony of julius caesar clemency he be say he mild in hi revenge have compel the pirate to yield by whom he have before be take prisoner and put to ransom forasmuch a he have threaten them with the cross he indeed condemn them to it but it be after they have be first strangle he punish hi secretary philemon who have attempt to poison him with no great severity than mere death without name that latin author who thus dare to allege a a testimony of mercy the kill only of those by whom we have be offend it be easy to guess that he be strike with the horrid and inhuman example of cruelty practise by the roman tyrant for my part even in justice itself all that exceed a simple death appear to me pure cruelty especially in u who ought have regard to their soul to dismiss them in a good and calm condition which can not be when we have agitate them by insufferable torment not long since a soldier who be a prisoner perceive from a tower where he be shut up that the people begin to assemble to the place of execution and that the carpenter be busy erect a scaffold he presently conclude that the preparation be for him and therefore enter into a resolution to kill himself but could find no instrument to assist him in hi design except an old rusty cartnail that fortune present to him with this he first give himself two great wound about hi throat but find these would not do he presently afterwards give himself a third in the belly where he leave the nail stick up to the head the first of hi keeper who come in found him in this condition yet alive but sink down and exhaust by hi wound to make use of time therefore before he should die they make haste to read hi sentence which have do and he hear that he be only condemn to be behead he seem to take new courage accept wine which he have before refuse and thank hi judge for the unhopedfor mildness of their sentence say that he have take a resolution to despatch himself for fear of a more severe and insupportable death have entertain an opinion by the preparation he have see in the place that they be resolve to torment him with some horrible execution and seem to be deliver from death in have it change from what he apprehend i should advise that those example of severity by which ti design to retain the people in their duty might be exercise upon the dead body of criminal for to see them deprive of sepulture to see them boil and divide into quarter would almost work as much upon the vulgar a the pain they make the living endure though that in effect be little or nothing a god himself say who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do and the poet singularly dwell upon the horror of this picture a something bad than death i happen to come by one day accidentally at rome just a they be upon execute catena a notorious robber he be strangle without any emotion of the spectator but when they come to cut him in quarter the hangman give not a blow that the people do not follow with a doleful cry and exclamation a if every one have lend hi sense of feeling to the miserable carcase those inhuman excess ought to be exercise upon the bark and not upon the quick artaxerxes in almost a like case moderate the severity of the ancient law of persia ordain that the nobility who have commit a fault instead of be whip a they be use to be should be strip only and their clothes whip for them and that whereas they be wont to tear off their hair they should only take off their highcrowned tiara the so devout egyptian think they sufficiently satisfy the divine justice by sacrifice hog in effigy and representation a bold invention to pay god so essential a substance in picture only and in show i live in a time wherein we abound in incredible example of this vice through the licence of our civil war and we see nothing in ancient history more extreme than what we have proof of every day but i can not any the more get use to it i could hardly persuade myself before i saw it with my eye that there could be find souls so cruel and fell who for the sole pleasure of murder would commit it would hack and lop off the limb of other sharpen their wit to invent unusual torment and new kind of death without hatred without profit and for no other end but only to enjoy the pleasant spectacle of the gesture and motion the lamentable groan and cry of a man die in anguish for this be the utmost point to which cruelty can arrive for my own part i can not without grief see so much a an innocent beast pursue and kill that have no defence and from which we have receive no offence at all and that which frequently happen that the stag we hunt find himself weak and out of breath and see no other remedy surrender himself to u who pursue him implore mercy by hi tear have ever be to me a very unpleasing sight and i hardly ever take a beast alive that i do not presently turn out again pythagoras buy them of fisherman and fowler to do the same those nature that be sanguinary towards beasts discover a natural proneness to cruelty after they have accustom themselves at rome to spectacle of the slaughter of animal they proceed to those of the slaughter of men of gladiator nature have herself i fear imprint in man a kind of instinct to inhumanity nobody take pleasure in see beast play with and caress one another but every one be delight with see them dismember and tear one another to piece and that i may not be laugh at for the sympathy i have with them theology itself enjoin u some favour in their behalf and consider that one and the same master have lodge u together in this palace for hi service and that they as well a we be of hi family it have reason to enjoin u some affection and regard to them pythagoras borrow the metempsychosis from the egyptian but it have since be receive by several nation and particularly by our druid the religion of our ancient gaul maintain that souls be eternal never cease to remove and shift their place from one body to another mix moreover with this fancy some consideration of divine justice for accord to the deportment of the soul whilst it have be in alexander they say that god assign it another body to inhabit more or less painful and proper for it condition if it have be valiant he lodge it in the body of a lion if voluptuous in that of a hog if timorous in that of a hart or hare if malicious in that of a fox and so of the rest till have purify it by this chastisement it again enter into the body of some other man a to the relationship betwixt u and beast i do not much admit of it nor of that which several nation and those among the most ancient and most noble have practise who have not only received brute into their society and companionship but have give them a rank infinitely above themselves esteem them one while familiar and favourite of the god and have them in more than human reverence and respect other acknowledge no other god or divinity than they and the very interpretation that plutarch give to this error which be very well conceive be advantageous to them for he say that it be not the cat or the ox for example that the egyptian adore but that they in those beast adore some image of the divine faculty in this patience and utility in that vivacity or a with our neighbour the burgundians and all the german impatience to see themselves shut up by which they represent liberty which they love and adore above all other godlike attribute and so of the rest but when amongst the more moderate opinion i meet with argument that endeavour to demonstrate the near resemblance betwixt u and animals how large a share they have in our great privilege and with how much probability they compare u together truly i abate a great deal of our presumption and willingly resign that imaginary sovereignty that be attribute to u over other creature but suppose all this be not true there be nevertheless a certain respect a general duty of humanity not only to beast that have life and sense but even to tree and plant we owe justice to men and graciousness and benignity to other creature that be capable of it there be a certain commerce and mutual obligation betwixt them and u nor shall i be afraid to confess the tenderness of my nature so childish that i can not well refuse to play with my dog when he the most unseasonably importunes me to do so the turk have alms and hospital for beast the roman have public care to the nourishment of geese by whose vigilance their capitol have be preserve the athenian make a decree that the mule and moyls which have serve at the building of the temple call hecatompedon should be free and suffer to pasture at their own choice without hindrance the agrigentines have a common use solemnly to inter the beast they have a kindness for a horse of some rare quality dog and useful bird and even those that have only be keep to divert their child and the magnificence that be ordinary with them in all other thing also particularly appear in the sumptuosity and number of monument erect to this end and which remain in their beauty several age after the egyptian bury wolf bear crocodile dog and cat in sacred place embalm their body and put on mourn at their death cimon give an honourable sepulture to the mare with which he have three time gain the prize of the course at the olympic game the ancient xantippus cause hi dog to be inter on an eminence near the sea which have ever since retain the name and plutarch say that he have a scruple about sell for a small profit to the slaughterer an ox that have be long in hi service learning be indeed a very great and a very material accomplishment and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understand but learn yet i do not prize it at the excessive rate that some other do a herillus the philosopher for one who therein place the sovereign good and maintain that it be only in her to render u wise and content which i do not believe no more than i do what other have say that learning be the mother of all virtue and that all vice proceeds from ignorance which if it be true require a very long interpretation my house have longbeen open to men of knowledge and be very well know to them for my father who govern it fifty year and upwards inflame with the new ardour with which francis the first embrace letter and bring them into esteem with great diligence and expense hunt after the acquaintance of learn men receive them into hi house a person sacred and that have some particular inspiration of divine wisdom collect their saying and sentence a so many oracle and with so much the great reverence and religion a he be the less able to judge of them for he have no knowledge of letter any more than hi predecessor for my part i love them well but i do not adore them amongst other peter bunel a man of great reputation for knowledge in hi time have with some other of hi sort staid some day at montaigne in my father company he present him at hi departure with a book entitle theologia naturalis sive liber creaturarum magistri raimondi de sebonde and a the italian and spanish tongue be familiar to my father and a this book be write in a sort of jargon of spanish with latin termination he hop that with a little help he might be able to understand it and therefore recommend it to him for a very useful book and proper tor the time wherein he give it to him which be when the novel doctrine of luther begin to be in vogue and in many place to stagger our ancient belief wherein he be very well advise wisely in hi own reason foresee that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism for the vulgar not have the faculty of judging of thing suffer themselves to be carry away by chance and appearance after have once be inspire with the boldness to despise and control those opinion which they have before have in extreme reverence such a those wherein their salvation be concern and that some of the article of their religion be bring into doubt and dispute they afterwards throw all other part of their belief into the same uncertainty they have with them no other authority or foundation than the other they have already discompose and shake off all the impression they have receive from the authority of the law or the reverence of the ancient custom a a tyrannical yoke resolve to admit nothing for the future to which they have not first interpose their own decree and give their particular consent it happen that my father a little before hi death have accidentally find this book under a heap of other neglected paper command me to translate it for him into french it be good too translate such author a this where there be little but the matter itself to express but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style be aim at be dangerous to attempt especially when a man be to turn them into a weak idiom it be a strange and a new undertaking for me but have by chance at that time nothing els to do and not be able to resist the command of the best father that ever be i do it as well a i could and he be so well pleased with it a to order it to be print which after hi death be do i find the idea of this author exceed fine the contexture of hi work well follow and hi design full of piety and because many people take a delight to read it and particularly the lady to whom we owe the most service i have often think to assist them to clear the book of two principal objection make to it hi design be bold and dare for he undertake by human and natural reason to establish and make good against the atheist all the article of the christian religion wherein to speak the truth he be so firm and so successful that i do not think it possible to do good upon that subject nay i believe he have be equal by none this work seem to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name be so little known and of whom all that we know be that he be a spaniard practising physic at toulouse about two hundred year ago i enquire of adrian turnebus who know all thing what he think of that book who make answer that he think it be some abstract drawn from st thomas daquin for that in truth hi mind so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety be alone capable of such thought be this a it may whoever be the author and inventor and ti not reasonable without great certainty to deprive sebond of that title he be a man of great judgment and most admirable part the first thing they reprehend in hi work be that christian be to blame to repose their belief upon human reason which be only conceive by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace in which objection there appear to be something of zeal to piety and therefore we be to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the great mildness and respect this be a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me who know nothing of it nevertheless i conceive that in a thing so divine so high and so far transcend all human intelligence a be that truth with which it have please the bounty of god to enlighten u it be very necessary that he should moreover lend u hi assistance a a very extraordinary favour and privilege to conceive and imprint it in our understanding and i do not believe that mean purely human be in any sort capable of do it for if they be so many rare and excellent soul and so abundantly furnish with natural force in former age could not have fail by their reason to arrive at this knowledge ti faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehend the deep mystery of our religion but withal i do not say that it be not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensil with which god have endow u to the service of our faith it be not to be doubt but that it be the most noble use we can put them to and that there be not a design in a christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all hi study to extend and amplify the truth of hi belief we do not satisfy ourselves with serve god with our soul and understanding only we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence and apply our limb and motion and external thing to do him honour we must here do the same and accompany our faith with all the reason we have but always with this reservation not to fancy that it be upon u that it depend nor that our argument and endeavour can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge if it enter not into u by an extraordinary infusion if it enter not only by reason but moreover by human way it be not in u in it true dignity and splendour and yet i be afraid we only have it by this way if we hold upon god by the mediation of a lively faith if we hold upon god by him and not by u if we have a divine basis and foundation human occasion would not have the power to shake u a they do our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery the love of novelty the constraint of prince the success of one party and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinion would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world we should withstand the fury of these wave with an immovable and unyielding constancy if we be but touch with this ray of divinity it would appear throughout not only our word but our work also would carry it brightness and lustre whatever proceed from u would be see illuminate with this noble light we ought to be ashamed that in all the human sect there never be any of the faction that do not in some measure conform hi life and behaviour to it whereas so divine and heavenly an institution do only distinguish christian by the name will you see the proof of this compare our manner to those of a mahometan or pagan you will still find that we fall very short there where out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all other and that it should be say of u be they so just so charitable so good then they be christian all other sign be common to all religion hope trust event ceremony penance martyr the peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue a it be also the most heavenly and difficult and the most worthy product of truth for this our good st louis be in the right who when the tartar king who be become christian design to come to lyon to kiss the pope foot and there to be an eyewitness of the sanctity he hop to find in our manner immediately divert him from hi purpose for fear l our disorderly way of living should on the contrary put him out of conceit with so holy a belief and yet it happen quite otherwise since to that other who go to rome to the same end and there see the dissoluteness of the prelate and people of that time settle himself so much the more firmly in our religion consider how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain it dignity and splendour among so much corruption and in so vicious hand if we have but one single grain of faith we should remove mountain from their place saith the sacred word our action that would then be direct and accompany by the divinity would not be merely human they would have in them something of miraculous as well a our belief brevis est institutio vit honest beauque si credo believe and the way to happiness and virtue be a short one some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not other more in number make themselves believe that they believe not be able to penetrate into what it be to believe we think it strange if in the civil war which at this time disorder our state we see event float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner which be because we bring nothing to it but our own justice which be in one party be only there for ornament and palliation it be indeed pretend but tis not there receive settle and espouse it be there as in the mouth of an advocate not a in the heart and affection of the party god owe hi extraordinary assistance to faith and religion not to our passion men there be the conductor and therein serve themselves with religion whereas it ought to be quite contrary observe if it be not by our own hand that we guide and train it and draw it like wax into so many contrary figure from a rule in itself so direct and firm when and where be this more manifest than in france in our day they who have take it on the leave hand they who have take it on the right they who call it black they who call it white alike employ it to their violent and ambitious design conduct it with a progress so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversitythey pretend in their opinion in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depend doubtful and hard to believe did one ever see come from the same school and discipline manner more united and more the same do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine argument to and fro and how irreligiously we have both reject and retake them accordas fortune have shift our place in these intestine storm this so solemn proposition whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arm against hi prince for the defence of hi religion do you remember in whose mouth the last year the affirmative of it be the prop of one party and the negative the pillar of another and hearken now from what quarter come the voice and instruction of the one and the other and if arm make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that we condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be make to bear the yoke of our necessity and how much bad do france than say it let u confess the truth whoever should draw out from the army even that raise by the king those who take up arm out of pure zeal to religion and also those who only do it to protect the law of their country or for the service of their prince could hardly out of both these put together make one complete company of gensdarmes whence do this proceed that there be so few to be find who have maintain the same will and the same progress in our civil commotion and that we see them one while move but a footpace and another run full speed and the same men one while damage our affair by their violent heat and fierceness and another by their coldness gentleness and slowness but that they be push on by particular and casual consideration accord to the variety wherein they move i evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other office but those that least suit with our own passion there hostility so admirable a the christian our zeal performs wonder when it second our inclination to hatred cruelty ambition avarice detraction and rebellion but when it move against the hair towards bounty benignity and temperance unless by miracle some rare and virtuous disposition prompt u to it we stir neither hand nor toot our religion be intend to extirpate vice whereas it screen nourishes and incite them we must not mock god if we believe in him i do not say by faith but with a simple belief that be to say and i speak it to our great shame if we believe in him and recognise him a we do any other history or a we would do one of our companion we should love him above all other thing for the infinite bounty and beauty that shin in himat least he would go equal in our affection with rich pleasure glory and our friend the best of u be not so much afraid to outrage him a he be afraid to injure hi neighbour hi kinsman or hi master be there any understanding so weak that have on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasure and on the other in equal knowledge and persuasion the state of an immortal glory would change the first for the other and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt for what lust tempt u to blaspheme if not perhaps the very desire to offend the philosopher antisthenes a he be be initiate in the mystery of orpheus the priest tell him that those who profess themselves of that religion be certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after deathif thou believest that answer he why dost thou not die thyself diogenes more rudely accord to hi manner and more remote from our purpose to the priest that in like manner preach to him to become of hi religion that he might obtain the happiness of the other worldwhat say he thou wouldest have me to believe that agesilaus and epaminondas who be so great men shall be miserable and that thou who art but a calf and canst do nothing to purpose shalt be happy because thou art a priest did we receive these great promise of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse we should not have death in so great horror i desire to be dissolve we should say and to be with jesus christ the force of plato argument concern the immortality of the soul set some of hi disciple to seek a premature grave that they might the sooner enjoy the thing he have make them hope for all this be a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion by our own hand and no otherwise than a other religion be receive either we be happen in the country where it be in practice or we reverence the antiquity of it or the authority of the men who have maintain it or fear the menace it fulminate against misbeliever or be allure by it promise these consideration ought tis true to be apply to our belief but a subsidiary only for they be human obligation another religion other witness the like promise and threat might by the same way imprint a quite contrary belief we be christian by the same title that we be perigordians or german and what plato say that there be few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power do not concern a true christian ti for mortal and human religion to be receive by human recommendation what kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in u a pleasant faith that do not believe what it believe but for want of courage to disbelieve it can a vicious passion such a inconstancy and astonishment cause any regular product in our soul they be confident in their judgment say he that what be say of hell and future torment be all feign but an occasion of make the expedient present itself when old age or disease bring them to the brink of the grave the terror of death by the horror of that future condition inspire them with a new belief and by reason that such impression render them timorous he forbid in hi law all such threatening doctrine and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the god except for hi great good when they happen to him and for a medicinal effect they say of bion that infect with the atheism of theodoras he have long have religious men in great scorn and contempt but that death surprising him he give himself up to the most extreme superstition a if the god withdraw and return accord to the necessity of bion plato and these example would conclude that we be bring to a belief of god either by reason or by force atheism be a proposition as unnatural a monstrous difficult also and hard to establish in the human understand how arrogant soever there be men enough see out of vanity and pride to be the author of extraordinary and reforming opinion and outwardly to affect the profession of them who if they be such fool have nevertheless not the power to plant them in their own conscience yet will they not fail to lift up their hand towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast and when fear or sickness have abate and dull the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily reunite and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconcile to the public faith and examples a doctrine seriously digest be one thing and those superficial impression another which spring from the disorder of an unhinged understanding float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy miserable and senseless men who strive to be bad than they can the error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth let this great soul of plato but great only in human greatness fall also into this other mistake that child and old men be most susceptible of religion a if it spring and derive it credit from our weakness the knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator should be a knot that derive it folding and strength not from our consideration from our reason and passion but from a divine and supernatural constraint have but one form one face and one lustre which be the authority of god and hi divine grace now the heart and soul be govern and command by faith ti but reason that they should muster all our other faculty accord a they be able to perform to the service and assistance of their design neither be it to be imagine that all this machine have not some mark imprint upon it by the hand of the mighty architect and that there be not in the thing of this world some image that in some measure resemble the workman who have build and form them he have in hi stupendous work leave the character of hi divinity and tis our own weakness only that hinders u from discern it ti what he himself be please to tell u that he manifest hi invisible operation to u by those that be visible sebond apply himself to this laudable and noble study and demonstrate to u that there be not any part or member of the world that disclaim or derogate from it maker it be to do wrong to the divine goodness do not the universe consent to our belief the heaven the earth the element our body and our soulsall thing concur to this we have but to find out the way to use them they instruct u if we be capable of instruction for this world be a sacred temple into which man be introduce there to contemplate statue not the work of a mortal hand but such a the divine purpose have make the object of sense the sun the star the water and the earth to represent those that be intelligible to u the invisible tiling of god say st paul appear by the creation of the world hi eternal wisdom and divinity be consider by hi work now our prayer and human discourse be but a sterile and undigested matter the grace of god be the form ti that which give fashion and value to it a the virtuous action of socrates and cato remain vain and fruitless for not have have the love and obedience to the true creator of all thing so be it with our imagination and discourse they have a kind of body but it be an inform mass without fashion and without light if faith and grace be not add thereto faith come to tinct and illustrate sehonds argument render them firm and stolid and to that degree that they be capable of serve for direction and of be the first guide to an elementary christian to put him into the way of this knowledge they in some measure form him to and render him capable of the grace of god by which mean he afterwards completes and perfect himself in the true belief i know a man of authority breed up to letter who have confess to me to have be bring back from the error of unbelief by sebonds argument and should they be strip of this ornament and of the assistance and approbation of the faith and be look upon a mere fancy only to contend with those who be precipitate into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion they will even there find them a solid and firm a any other of the same quality that can be oppose against them so that we shall be ready to say to our opponent let them admit the force of our reason or let them show u other and upon some other subject good woven and of finer thread i be unawares half engage in the second objection to which i propose to make answer in the behalf of sebond some say that hi argument be weak and unable to make good what he intend and undertake with great ease to confute them these be to be a little more roughly handle for they be more dangerous and malicious than the first men willingly wrest the saying of other to favour their own prejudicate opinion to an atheist all writing tend to atheism he corrupt the most innocent matter with hi own venom these have their judgment so prepossess that they can not relish sebonds reason a to the rest they think we give them very fair play in put them into the liberty of combat our religion with weapon merely human whom in her majesty full of authority and command they durst not attack the mean that i shall use and that i think most proper to subdue this frenzy be to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance to make them sensible of the inanity vanity and vileness of man to wrest the wretched arm of their reason out of their hand to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the divine majesty ti to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain that alone that can make a true estimate of itself and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon god permit not any be but himself to be truly wise let u subdue this presumption the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit deus superbis resistit humilibus autem dal gratiam god resist the proud but give grace to the humble understanding be in the god say plato and not at all or very little in men now it be in the mean time a great consolation to a christian man to see our frail and mortal part so fitly suit to our holy and divine faith that when we employ them to the subject of their own mortal and frail nature they be not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjust let u see then if man have in hi power other more forcible and convince reason than those of sebond that be to say if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason for st augustin dispute against these people have good cause to reproach them with injustice in that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason can not establish and to show that a great many thing may be and have be of which our nature could not sound the reason and cause he propose to them certain know and undoubted experiment wherein men confess they see nothing and this he do a all other thing with a curious and ingenious inquisition we must do more than this and make them know that to convince the weakness of their reason there be no necessity of cull out uncommon example and that it be so defective and so blind that there be no faculty clear enough for it that to it the easy and the hard be all one that all subject equally and nature in general disclaim it authority and reject it mediation what do truth mean when she preach to u to fly worldly philosophy when she so often inculcate to u that our wisdom be but folly in the sight of god that the vainest of all vanity be man that the man who presume upon hi wisdom do not yet know what wisdom be and that man who be nothing if he think himself to be anything do seduce and deceive himself these sentence of the holy spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which i would maintain that i should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to hi authority but these will be whip at their own expense and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself let u then for once consider a man alone without foreign assistance arm only with hi own proper arm and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom which be all hi honour strength and the foundation of hi be let u see how he stand in this fine equipage let him make me understand by the force of hi reason upon what foundation he have build those great advantage he think he have over other creature who have make him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch the eternal light of those luminary that roll so high over hi head the wondrous and fearful motion of that infinite ocean should be establish and continue so many age for hi service and convenience can any thing be imagine so ridiculous that this miserable and wretched creature who be not so much a master of himself but subject to the injury of all thing should call himself master and emperor of the world of which he have not power to know the least part much less to command the whole and the privilege which he attribute to himself of be the only creature in this vast fabric who have the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it the only one who can return thanks to the architect and keep account of the revenue and disbursement of the world who i wonder seal him this patent let u see hi commission for this great employment be it grant in favour of the wise only few people will be concern in it are fool and wicked person worthy so extraordinary a favour and be the bad part of the world to be prefer before the rest shall we believe this manfor whose sake shall we therefore conclude that the world be make for theirs who have the use of reason these be god and men than whom certainly nothing can be good we can never sufficiently decry the impudence of this conjunction but wretched creature what have he in himself worthy of such an advantage consider the incorruptible existence of the celestial body beauty magnitude and continual revolution by so exact a rule consider the dominion and influence those body have not only over our life and fortune but even over our inclination our thought and will which they govern incite and agitate at the mercy of their influence a our reason teach u see that not only a man not only king but that monarchy empire and all this low world follow the influence of the celestial motion if our virtue our vice our knowledge and this very discourse we be upon of the power of the star and the comparison we be make betwixt them and u proceed a our reason supposes from their favour if we derive this little portion of reason we have from the bounty of heaven how be it possible that reason should ever make u equal to it how subject it essence and condition to our knowledge whatever we see in those body astonish u qu molitio qua ferramenta qui vectes qu machina qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt what contrivance what tool what material what engine be employ about so stupendous a work why do we deprive them of soul of life and discourse have we discover in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity we who have no commerce with them but by obedience shall we say that we have discover in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul what have we see any thing like the sun do he cease to be because we have see nothing like him and do hi motion cease because there be no other like them if what we have not see be not our knowledge be marvellously contract qu sunt tant animi angusti how narrow be our understanding be they not dream of human vanity to make the moon a celestial earth there to fancy mountain and vale a anaxagoras do there to fix habitation and human abode and plant colony for our convenience a plato and plutarch have do and of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star amongst the other inconvenience of mortality this be one that darkness of the understanding which lead men astray not so much from a necessity of err but from a love of error the corruptible body stupifies the soul and the earthly habitation dull the faculty of the imagination presumption be our natural and original disease the most wretched and frail of all creature be man and withal the proudest he feel and see himself lodge here in the dirt and filth of the world nail and rivet to the bad and dead part of the universe in the low story of the house the most remote from the heavenly arch with animal of the bad condition of the three and yet in hi imagination will be place himself above the circle of the moon and bring the heaven under hi foot ti by the same vanity of imagination that he equal himself to god attribute to himself divine quality withdraws and separate himself from the the crowd of other creature cut out the share of the animal hi fellow and companion and distribute to them portion of faculty and force a himself think fit how do he know by the strength of hi understand the secret and internal motion of animalsfrom what comparison betwixt them and u do he conclude the stupidity he attribute to them when i play with my cat who know whether i do not make her more sport than she make me we mutually divert one another with our play if i have my hour to begin or to refus she also have hers plato in hi picture of the golden age under saturn reckons among the chief advantage that a man then have hi communication with beast of whom inquire and inform himself he know the true quality and difference of them all by which he acquire a very perfect intelligence and prudence and lead hi life more happily than we could do need we a good proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beast this great author be of opinion that nature for the most part in the corporal form she give them have only regard to the use of prognostic that be derive thence in hi time the defect that hinders communication betwixt them and u why may it not be in our part as well a theirs ti yet to determine where the fault lie that we understand not one anotherfor we understand them no more than they do u and by the same reason they may think u to be beast a we think them ti no great wonder if we understand not them when we do not understand a basque or a troglodyte and yet some have boast that they understand them a apollonius tyanaus melampus tiresias thales and other and see a cusmographers report that there be nation that have a dog for their king they must of necessity be able to interpret hi voice and motion we must observe the parity betwixt u have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning and so have beast of oursmuch about the same they caress u threaten u and beg of u and we do the same to them a to the rest we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves and that they perfectly understand one another not only those of the same but of diver kind in one kind of barking of a dog the horse know there be anger of another sort of bark he be not afraid even in the very beasts that have no voice at all we easily conclude from the society of office we observe amongst them some other sort of communication their very motion discover it and why not as well a our dumb people dispute argue and tell story by sign of whom i have see some by practice so clever and active that way that in fact they want nothing of the perfection of make themselves understood lover be angry reconciled intreat thank appoint and in short speak all thing by their eye what with the hand we require promise call dismiss threaten pray supplicate deny refuse interrogate admire number confess repent fear express confusion doubt instruct command incite encourage swear testify accuse condemn absolve abuse despise defy provoke flat

the head we invite remand confess deny give the lie welcome honour reverence disdain demand rejoice lament reject caress rebuke submit huff encourage threaten assure and inquire what with the eyebrowswhat with the shoulder there be not a motion that do not speak and in an intelligible language without discipline and a public language that every one understand whence it should follow the variety and use distinguish from other consider that these should rather be judge the property of human nature i omit what necessity particularly do suddenly suggest to those who be in needthe alphabet upon the finger grammar in gesture and the science which be only by them exercise and express and the nation that pliny report have no other language an ambassador of the city of abdera after a long conference with agis king of sparta demand of him well sir what answer must i return to my fellowcitizens that i have give thee leave say he to say what thou wouldest and as much a thou wouldest without ever speak a word be not this a silent speaking and very easy to be understood a to the rest what be there in u that we do not see in the operation of animal is there a polity well order the office well distribute and more inviolably observe and maintain than that of bee can we imagine that such and so regular a distribution of employment can be carry on without reason and deliberation the swallow that we see at the return of the spring search all the corner of our house for the most commodious place wherein to build their nest do they seek without judgment and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose without discretion and in that elegant and admirable contexture of their building can bird rather make choice of a square figure than a round of an obtuse than of a right angle without know their property and effect do they bring water and then clay without know that the hardness of the latter grows softer by be wet do they mat their palace with moss or down without foresee that their tender young will lie more safe and easy do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy wind and place their lodging against the east without know the different quality of the wind and consider that one be more wholesome than another why do the spider make her web tighter in one place and slacker in another why now make one sort of knot and then another if she have not deliberation think and conclusion we sufficiently discover in most of their work how much animal excel u and how unable our art be to imitate them we see nevertheless in our rougher performance that we employ all our faculty and apply the utmost power of our soul why do we not conclude the same of them why should we attribute to i know not what natural and servile inclination the work that excel all we can do by nature and art wherein without be aware we give them a mighty advantage over u in make nature with maternal gentleness and love accompany and learn them a it be by the hand to all the action and commodity of their life whilst she leave u to chance and fortune and to seek out by art the thing that be necessary to our conservation at the same time deny u the mean of be able by any instruction or effort of understand to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beast so that their brutish stupidity surpasses in all convenience all that our divine intelligence can do really at this rate we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother but it be nothing so our polity be not so irregular and unformed nature have universally care for all her creature and there be not one she have not amply furnish with all mean necessary for the conservation of it be for the common complaint i hear men make a the license of their opinion one while lift them up above the cloud and then again depress them to the antipode that we be the only animal abandon naked upon the bare earth tie and bound not have wherewithal to arm and clothe u but by the spoil of other whereas nature have cover all other creature either with shell husk bark hair wool prickle leather down feather scale or silk accord to the necessity of their be have arm them with talon teeth or horn wherewith to assault and defend and have herself teach them that which be most proper for them to swim to run to fly and sing whereas man neither know how to walk speak eat or do any thing but weep without teach these complaint be false there be in the polity of the world a great equality and more uniform relation our skin be a sufficient to defend u from the injury of the weather a theirs be witness several nation that yet know not the use of clothes our ancient gaul be but slenderly clad any more than the irish our neighbour though in so cold a climate but we may better judge of this by ourselves for all those part that we be pleased to expose to the air be find very able to endure it the face the foot the hand the arm the head accord to the various habit if there be a tender part about u and that would seem to be in danger from cold it should be the stomach where the digestion be and yet our forefather be there always open and our lady a tender and delicate a they be go sometimes halfbare as low a the navel neither be the binding or swathing of infant any more necessary and the lacedmoman mother bring theirs in all liberty of motion of member without any ligature at all our cry be common with the great part of other animal and there be but few creature that be not observe to groan and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world forasmuch a it be a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves a to the custom of eat it be in u a in them natural and without instruction who doubt but an infant arrive to the strength of feed himself may make shift to find something to eat and the earth produce and offer him wherewithal to supply hi necessity without other culture and artifice and if not at all time no more do she do it to beast witness the provision we see ant and other creature hoard up against the dead season of the year the late discover nation so abundantly furnish with natural meat and drink without care or without cookery may give u to understand that bread be not our only food and that without tillage our mother nature have provide u sufficiently of all we stand in need of nay it appear more fully and plentifully than she do at present now that we have add our own industry the debauchery and irregularity of our appetite outstrip all the invention we can contrive to satisfy it a to arm we have more natural one than than most other animal more various motion of limb and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them those that be train to fight naked be see to throw themselves into the like hazard that we do if some beast surpass u in this advantage we surpass many other and the industry of fortify the body and cover it by acquire mean we have by instinct and natural precept that it be so the elephant show who sharpen and whet the teeth he make use of in war for he have particular one for that service which he spar and never employ them at all to any other use when bull go to fight they toss and throw the dust about them boar whet their tusk and the ichneumon when he be about to engage with the crocodile fortify hi body and cover and crust it all over with closewrought and welltempered slime a with a cuirass why shall we not say that it be also natural for u to arm ourselves with wood and iron a to speech it be certain that if it be not natural it be not necessary nevertheless i believe that a child which have be bring up in an absolute solitude remote from all society of men which would be an experiment very hard to make would have some kind of speech to express hi meaning by and ti not to be suppose that nature should have deny that to u which she have give to several other animal for what be this faculty we observe in them of complain rejoice call to one another for succour and invite each other to love which they do with the voice other than speech and why should they not speak to one another they speak to u and we to them in how many several sort of way do we speak to our dog and they answer u we converse with them in another sort of language and use other appellation than we do with bird hog oxen horse and alter the idiom accord to the kind lactantius seem to attribute to beast not only speech but laughter also and the difference of language which be see amongst u accord to the difference of country be also observe in animal of the same kind aristotle in proof of this instance the various call of partridge accord to the situation of place but it be yet to be know what language this child would speak and of that what be say by guess have no great appearance if a man will allege to me in opposition to this opinion that those who be naturally deaf speak not i answer that this be not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear but rather because the sense of hearing of which they be deprive relates to that of speaking and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within and make it sound in our own ear before we can utter it to other all this i have say to prove the resemblance there be in human thing and to bring u back and join u to the crowd we be neither above nor below the rest all that be under heaven say the sage run one law and one fortune there be indeed some differencethere be several order and degree but it be under the aspect of one and the same nature man must be compel and restrain within the bound of this polity miserable creature he be not in a condition really to step over the rail he be fetter and circumscribe he be subject to the same necessity that the other creature of hi rank and order be and of a very mean condition without any prerogative of true and real preeminence that which he attribute to himself by vain fancy and opinion have neither body nor taste and if it be so that he only of all the animal have this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thought represent to him that which be that which be not and that he would have the false and the true ti an advantage dearly buy and of which he have very little reason to be proud for thence spring the principal and original fountain of all the evil that befal himsin sickness irresolution affliction despair i say then to return to my subject that there be no appearance to induce a man to believe that beast should by a natural and forced inclination do the same thing that we do by our choice and industry we ought from like effect to conclude like faculty and from great effect great faculty and consequently confess that the same reasoning and the same way by which we operate be common with them or that they have other that be good why should we imagine this natural constraint in them who experience no such effect in ourselves add that it be more honourable to be guide and oblige to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition and nearer ally to the divinity than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty and more safe to entrust the rein of our conduct in the hand of nature than our own the vanity of our presumption make u prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertion than to her bounty and to enrich the other animal with natural good and abjure them in their favour in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with good acquire very foolishly in my opinion for i should as much value part and virtue naturally and purely my own a those i have beg and obtain from education it be not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favour of god and nature for instance take the fox the people of thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river and turn him out before them to that purpose when we see him lay hi ear upon the bank of the river down to the ice to listen if from a more remote or near distance he can hear the noise of the water current and accord a he find by that the ice to be of a less or great thickness to retire or advancehave we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thought pass through hi head that we should have upon the like occasion and that it be a ratiocination and consequence drawn from natural sense that that which make a noise run that which run be not frozen what be not frozen be liquid and that which be liquid yield to impression for to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hear without reason and consequence be a chimra that can not enter into the imagination we be to suppose the same of the many sort of subtlety and invention with which beasts secure themselves from and frustrate the enterprizes we plot against them and if we will make an advantage even of this that it be in our power to seize them to employ them in our service and to use them at our pleasure ti still but the same advantage we have over one another we have our slave upon these term the climacid be they not woman in syria who squat on all four serve for a ladder or footstool by which the lady mount their coach and the great part of free person surrender for very trivial convenience their life and be into the power of another the wife and concubine of the thracian contend who should be choose to be slay upon their husband tomb have tyrant ever fail of find men enough vow to their devotion some of them moreover add this necessity of accompany them in death as well a life whole army have bind themselves after this manner to their captain the form of the oath in the rude school of gladiator be in these word we swear to suffer ourselves to be chain burnt wound and kill with the sword and to endure all that true gladiator suffer from their master religiously engage both body and soul in hi service this be an obligation indeed and yet there in one year ten thousand enter into it to their destruction when the scythian inter their king they strangle upon hi body the most beloved of hi concubine hi cupbearer the master of hi horse hi chamberlain the usher of hi chamber and hi cook and upon the anniversary thereof they kill fifty horse mount by fifty page that they have impale all up the spine of the back to the throat and there leave them fix in triumph about hi tomb the men that serve u do it cheap and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawk horse and dog withal to what solicitude do we not submit for the convenience of these i do not think that servant of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their master that prince think it an honour to do for their beast diogenes see hi relation solicitous to redeem him from servitude they be fool say he tis he that keep and nourishes me that in reality serf me and they who entertain beast ought rather to be say to serve them than to be serve by them and withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submit to another lion nor one horse to another for want of courage a we go to the chase of beast so do tiger and lion to the chase of men and do the same execution upon one another dog upon hare pike upon tench swallow upon grasshopper and sparrowhawks upon blackbird and lark we divide the quarry as well a the pain and labour of the chase with our hawk and hound and about amphipolis in thrace the hawker and wild falcon equally divide the prey in the half a also along the lake motis if the fisherman do not honestly leave the wolf an equal share of what he have catch they presently go and tear hi net in piece and a we have a way of sport that be carry on more by subtlety than force a spring hare and angle with line and hook there be also the like amongst other animal aristotle say that the cuttlefish cast a gut out of her throat as long a a line which she extend and draw back at pleasure and a she perceive some little fish approach her she let it nibble upon the end of this gut lie herself conceal in the sand or mud and by little and little draw it in till the little fish be so near her that at one spring she may catch it a to strength there be no creature in the world expose to so many injury a man we need not a whale elephant or a crocodile nor any suchlike animal of which one alone be sufficient to dispatch a great number of men to do our business louse be sufficient to vacate syllas dictatorship and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor be the breakfast of a little contemptible worm why should we say that it be only for man or knowledge build up by art and meditation to distinguish the thing useful for hi be and proper for the cure of hi disease and those which be not to know the virtue of rhubarb and polypody when we see the goat of candia when wound with an arrow among a million of plant choose out dittany for their cure and the tortoise when she have eat a viper immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her the dragon to rub and clear hi eye with fennel the stork to give themselves clyster of seawater the elephant to draw not only out of their own body and those of their companion but out of the body of their master too witness the elephant of king porus whom alexander defeat the dart and javelin throw at them in battle and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patientwhy do we not say here also that this be knowledge and reason for to allege to their disparagement that ti by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this be not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason but with great force to attribute it to them than to u for the honour of so infallible a mistress chrysippus though in other thing a scornful a judge of the condition of animal a any other philosopher whatever consider the motion of a dog who come to a place where three way meet either to hunt after hi master he have lose or in pursuit of some game that fly before him go snuff first in one of the way and then in another and after have make himself sure of two without find the trace of what he seek dash into the third without examination be force to confess that this reasoning be in the dog i have trace my master to this place he must of necessity be go one of these three way he be not go this way nor that he must then infallibly be go this other and that assure himself by this conclusion he make no use of hi nose in the third way nor ever lay it to the ground but suffers himself to be carry on there bv the force of reason this sally purely logical and this use of proposition divide and conjoin and the right enumeration of part be it not every whit a good that the dog know all this of himself as well a from trapezuntius animal be not incapable however of be instruct after our method we teach blackbird raven pie and parrot to speak and the facility wherewith we see they lend u their voice and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant to be form and confine within a certain number of letter and syllable do evince that they have a reason within which render them so docile and willing to learn everybody i believe be glut with the several sort of trick that tumbler teach their dog the dance where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear the several various motion and leap they make them perform by the command of a word but i observe this effect with the great admiration which nevertheless be very common in the dog that lead the blind both in the country and in city i have take notice how they stop at certain door where they be wont to receive alms how they avoid the encounter of coach and cart even there where they have sufficient room to pass i have see them by the trench of a town forsake a plain and even path and take a bad only to keep their master far from the ditchhow could a man have make this dog understand that it be hi office to look to hi master safely only and to despise hi own conveniency to serve him and how have he the knowledge that a way be wide enough for him that be not so for a blind man can all this be apprehend without ratiocination i must not omit what plutarch say he saw of a dog at rome with the emperor vespasian the father at the theatre of marcellus this dog serve a player that play a farce of several part and personage and have therein hi part he have amongst other thing to counterfeit himself for some time dead by reason of a certain drug he be suppose to eat after he have swallow a piece of bread which pass for the drug he begin after awhile to tremble and stagger a if he be take giddy at last stretch himself out stiff a if dead he suffer himself to be draw and drag from place to place a it be hi part to do and afterward when he know it to be time he begin first gently to stir a if awake out of a profound sleep and lift up hi head look about him after such a manner a astonish all the spectator the ox that serve in the royal garden of susa to water them and turn certain great wheel to draw water for that purpose to which bucket be fasten such a there be many in languedoc be order every one to draw a hundred turn a day they be so accustomed to this number that it be impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more but their task be perform they would suddenly stop and stand still we be almost men before we can count a hundred and have lately discover nation that have no knowledge of number at all there be more understanding require in the teaching of other than in be teach now set aside what democritus hold and prove that most of the art we have be teach u by other animal a by the spider to weave and sew by the swallow to build by the swan and nightingale music and by several animal to make medicinesaristotle be of opinion that the nightingale teach their young one to sing and spend a great deal of time and care in it whence it happen that those we bring up in cage and which have not have the time to learn of their parent want much of the grace of their singing we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study and even amongst the wild it be not all and every one alikeevery one have learn to do good or bad accord to their capacity and so jealous be they one of another whilst learn that they contention with emulation and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place the breath rather fail than the voice the young ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken note the disciple listen to the master lesson and give the best account he be able they be silent oy turn one may hear fault correct and observe some reprehension of the teacher have formerly see say arrian an elephant have a cymbal hung at each leg and another fasten to hi trunk at the sound of which all the other dance round about him rise and bend at certain cadence a they be guide by the instrument and twas delightful to hear this harmony in the spectacle of rome there be ordinarily see elephant teach to move and dance to the sound of the voice dance wherein be several change and cadence very hard to learn and some have be know so intent upon their lesson a privately to practice it by themselves that they might not be chidden nor beat by their master but this other story of the pie of which we have plutarch himself for a warrant be very strange she live in a barber shop at rome and do wonder in imitate with her voice whatever she hear it happen one day that certain trumpeter stand a good while sound before the shop after that and all the next day the pie be pensive dumb and melancholic which every body wonder at and think the noise of the trumpet have so stupified and astonish her that her voice be go with her hearing but they find at last that it be a profound meditation and a retiring into herself her thought exercise and prepare her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpet so that the first voice she utter be perfectly to imitate their strain stop and change have by this new lesson quit and take in disdain all she have learn before i will not omit this other example of a dog also which the same plutarch i be sadly confound all order but i do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book which plutarch say he saw on board a ship this dog be puzzle how to get the oil that be in the bottom of a jar which he could not reach with hi tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel go and fetch stone and let them fall into the jar till he make the oil rise so high that he could reach it what be this but an effect of a very subtle capacity ti say that the raven of barbary do the same when the water they would drink be too low this action be somewhat akin to what juba a king of their nation relates of the elephant that when by the craft of the hunter one of them be trap in certain deep pit prepare for them and cover over with brush to deceive them all the rest in great diligence bring a great many stone and log of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out but this animal in several other effect come so near to human capacity that should i particularly relate all that experience hath deliver to u i should easily have what i usually maintain granted namely that there be more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man the keeper of an elephant in a private house of syria rob him every meal of the half of hi allowance one day hi master would himself fee him and pour the full measure of barley he have order for hi allowance into hi manger which the elephant cast an angry look at the keeper with hi trunk separate the onehalf from the other and thrust it aside by that declare the wrong be do him and another have a keeper that mixed stone with hi corn to make up the measure come to the pot where he be boil meat for hi own dinner and fill it with ash these be particular effect but that which all the world have see and all the world know that in all the army of the levant one of the great force consist in elephant with whom they do without comparison much great execution than we now do with our artillery which take pretty nearly their place in a day of battle a may easily be suppose by such a be well read in ancient history they must necessarily have very confidently rely upon the fidelity and understanding of these beast when they entrust them with the vanguard of a battle where the least stop they should have make by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their body and the least fright that should have make them face about upon their own people have be enough to spoil all and there be but few example where it have happen that they have fall foul upon their own troop whereas we ourselves break into our own battalion and rout one another they have the charge not of one simple movement only but of many several thing to be perform in the battle a the spaniard do to their dog in their new conquest of the indie to whom they give pay and allow them a share in the spoil and those animal show a much dexterity and judgment in pursue the victory and stop the pursuit in charge and retire a occasion require and in distinguish their friend from their enemy a they do ardour and fierceness we more admire and value thing that be unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation i have not els so long insisted upon these example for i believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animal we have amongst u may there find a wonderful effect a those we seek in remote country and age ti one and the same nature that roll on her course and whoever have sufficiently consider the present state of thing might certainly conclude a to both the future ana the past i have formerly see men bring hither by sea from very distant country whose language not be understand by u and moreover their mien countenance and habit be quite differ from ours which of u do not repute them savage and brute who do not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute ignorant of the french tongue ignorant of our salutation and cringe our port and behaviour from which all human nature must by all mean take it pattern and example all that seem strange to u and that we do not understand we condemn the same thing happens also in the judgment we make of beast they have several condition like to ours from those we may by comparison draw some conjecture but by those quality that be particular to themselves what know we what to make of them the horse dog oxen sheep bird and most of the animal that live amongst u know our voice and suffer themselves to be govern by them so do crassuss lamprey and come when he call it a also do the eel that be find in the lake arethusa and i have see several pond where the fish come to eat at a certain call of those who use to fee them we may judge of that we may also say that the elephant have some participation of religion forasmuch a after several washing and purification they be observe to lift up their trunk like arm and fix their eye towards the rising of the sun continue long in meditation and contemplation at certain hour of the day of their own motion without instruction or precept but because we do not see any such sign in other animal we can not for that conclude that they be without religion nor make any judgment of what be conceal from u a we discern something in this action which the philosopher cleanthes take notice of because it something resemble our own he saw he say ant go from their anthill carry the dead body of an ant towards another anthill whence several other ant come out to meet them a if to speak with them where after have be a while together the last return to consult you may suppose with their fellowcitizens and so make two or three journey by reason of the difficulty of capitulation in the conclusion the last comer bring the first a worm out of their burrow a it be for the ransom of the defunct which the first laid upon their back and carry home leave the dead body to the other this be the interpretation that cleanthes give of this transaction give u by that to understand that those creature that have no voice be not nevertheless without intercourse and mutual communication whereof ti through our own defect that we do not participate and for that reason foolishly take upon u to pass our censure but they yet produce either effect far beyond our capacity to which we be so far from be able to arrive by imitation that we can not so much a by imitation conceive it many be of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that antony lose to augustus hi admiral galley be stay in the middle of her course by the little fish the latin call remora by reason of the property she have of stay all sort of vessel to which she fasten herself and the emperor caligula sail with a great navy upon the coast of romania hi galley only be suddenly stay by the same fish which he cause to be take fastened a it be to the keel of hi ship very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea the wind and the force of all hi oar by be only fasten by the beak to hi galley for it be a shellfish and be moreover not without great reason astonish that be bring to him in the vessel it have no longer the strength it have without a citizen of cyzicus formerly acquire the reputation of a good mathematician for have learnt the quality of the hedgehog he have hi burrow open in diver place and to several wind and foresee the wind that be to come stop the hole on that side which that citizen observe give the city certain prediction of the wind which be presently to blow the camlon take her colour from the place upon which she be lay but the polypus give himself what colour he please accord to occasion either to conceal himself from what he fear or from what he have a design to seize in the camlon ti a passive but in the polypus ti an active change we have some change of colour a in fear anger shame and other passion that alter our complexion but it be by the effect of suffer a with the camlon it be in the power of the jaundice indeed to make u turn yellow but tis not in the power of our own will now these effect that we discover in other animal much great than ours seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to u a ti to be presume there be several other quality and ability of theirs of which no appearance have arrive at u amongst all the prediction of elder time the most ancient and the most certain be those take from the flight of bird we have nothing certain like it nor any thing to be so much admire that rule and order of the moving of the wing whence they derive the consequence of future thing must of necessity be guide by some excellent mean to so noble an operation for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition without the intelligence consent and meditation of him by whom it be produce be an opinion evidently false that it be so the crampfish have this quality not only to benumb all the member that touch her but even through the net transmit a heavy dulness into the hand of those that move and handle them nay it be far say that if one pour water upon her he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand and stupefy the feeling through the water this be a miraculous force but ti not useless to the crampfish she know it and make use ont for to catch the prey she desire she will bury herself in the mud that other fish swim over her struck and benumb with this coldness of hers may fall into her power crane swallow and other bird of passage by shift their abode accord to the season sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty and put it in use huntsman assure u that to cull out from amongst a great many puppy that which ought to be preserve a the best the best way be to refer the choice to the mother a thus take them and carry them out of the kennel and the first she bring back will certainly be the best or if you make a show a if you would environ the kennel with fire that one she first catch up to save by which it appear they have a sort of prognostic which we have not or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelp other and more certain than we have the manner of come into the world of engender nourish act move living and dying of beast be so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving cause and add to our own condition above theirs can by no mean proceed from any meditation of our own reason for the regimen of our health physician propose to u the example of the beast manner and way of living for this say out of plutarch have in all time be in the mouth of these people keep warm thy foot and head a to the rest live like a beast the chief of all natural action be generation we have a certain disposition of member which be the most proper for u to that end nevertheless we be order by lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brute a the most effectual and the same authority condemns a hurtful those indiscreet and impudent motion which the woman have add of their own invention to whom it propose the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beast of their own sex if it be justice to render to every one their due the beast that serve love and defend their benefactor and that pursue and fall upon stranger and those who offend them do in this represent a certain air of our justice a also in observe a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young and a to friendship they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have king lysimachus dog hyrcanus master be dead lay on hi bed obstinately refuse either to eat or drink and the day that hi body be burnt he take a run and leap into the fire where he be consume a also do the dog of one pyrrhus for he would not stir from off hi master bed from the time he die and when they carry him away let himself be carry with him and at last leap into the pile where they burn hi master body there be inclination of affection which sometimes spring in u without the consultation of reason and by a fortuitous temerity which other call sympathy of which beast be as capable a we we see horse take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel when separate we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind and where they meet it run to it with great joy and demonstration of good will and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour animal have choice as well a we in their amour and cull out their mistress neither be they exempt from our jealousy and implacable malice desire be either natural and necessary a to eat and drink or natural and not necessary a the couple with female or neither natural nor necessary of which last sort be almost all the desire of men they be all superfluous and artificial for ti marvellous how little will satisfy nature how little she have leave u to desire our ragout and kickshaw be not of her order the stoic say that a man may live on an olive a day the delicacy of our wine be no part of her instruction nor the refinement we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetite these irregular desire that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infuse into u be so many that they almost exclude all the natural just a if there be so great a number of stranger in the city a to thrust out the natural inhabitant or usurp upon their ancient right and privilege should extinguish their authority and introduce new law and custom of their own animal be much more regular than we and keep themselves with great moderation within the limit nature have prescribe but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauch and a there have be furious desire that have impel men to the love of beast so there have be example of beast that have fall in love with u and be seize with monstrous affection betwixt kinds witness the elephant who be rival to aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herbwench in the city of alexandria who be nothing behind him in all the office of a very passionate suitor for go through the market where they sell fruit he would take some in hi trunk and carry them to her he would as much a possible keep her always in hi sight and would sometimes put hi trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom to feel her breast they tell also of a dragon in love with a girl and of a goose enamoured of a child of a ram that be suitor to the minstrelless glaucia in the town of asopus and we see not unfrequently baboon furiously in love with woman we see also certain male animal that be fond of the male of their own kind oppian and other give u some example of the reverence that beast have to their kindred in their copulation but experience often show u the contrary and for subtle cunning can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher thales mule who ford a river laden with salt and by accident stumble there so that the sack he carry be all wet perceiving that by the melting of the salt hi burden be something lighter he never fail so oft a he come to any river to lie down with hi load till hi master discover the knavery order that he should be laden with wood wherein find himself mistaken he cease to practise that device there be several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can and hide it with that exceed great care though they never make any use of it at all a to thrift they surpass u not only in the foresight and lay up and save for the time to come but they have moreover a great deal of the science necessary thereto the ant bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty l they should decay and rot but the caution and prevention they use in gnaw their grain of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence for by reason that the wheat do not always continue sound and dry but grow soft thaw and dissolve a if it be steep in milk whilst hasting to germination for fear l it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout a to what concern war which be the great and most magnificent of human action i would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or on contrary for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection a in truth the science of undo and kill one another and of ruining and destroy our own kind have nothing in it so tempt a to make it be covet by beast who have it not yet be they not universally exempt witness the furious encounter of bee and the enterprise of the prince of the contrary army i never read this divine description but that methinks i there see human folly and vanity represent in their true and lively colour for these warlike movement that so ravish u with their astounding noise and horror this rattle of gun drum and cry in the dreadful embattling of so many thousand of arm men and so great fury ardour and courage ti pleasant to consider by what idle occasion they be excite and by how light one appease all asia be ruin and destroy for the lust of paris the envy of one single man a despite a pleasure a domestic jealousy cause that ought not to set two oysterwenches by the ear be the mover of all this mighty bustle shall we believe those very men who be themselves the principal author of these mischief let u then hear the great the most powerful the most victorious emperor that ever be turn into a jest very pleasantly and ingeniously several battle fight both by sea and land the blood and life of five hundred thousand men that follow hi fortune and the strength and rich of two part of the world drain for the expense of hi expedition i use my latin with the liberty of conscience you be pleased to allow me now this great body with so many front and so many motion which seem to threaten heaven and earth this furious monster with so many head and arm be yet manfeeble calamitous and miserable man ti but an anthill disturb and provoke a contrary blast the croaking of a flight of raven the stumble of a horse the casual passage of an eagle a dream a voice a sign a morning mist be any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn him dart but a sunbeam in hi face he be melt and vanish blow but a little dust in hi eye a our poet say of the bee and all our ensign and legion with the great pompey himself at the head of them be rout and crush to piece for it be he a i take it that sertorious beat in spain with those fine arm which also serve eumenes against antigonus and surena against crassus let u but slip our fly after them and they will have the force and courage to defeat them of fresh memory the portuguese have besiege the city of tamly in the territory of xiatine the inhabitant of the place bring a great many hive of which be great plenty in that place upon the wall and with fire drive the bee so furiously upon the enemy that they give over the enterprise not be able to stand their attack and endure their sting and so the citizen by this new sort of relief gain liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune that at the return of their defender from the battle they find they have not lose so much a one the soul of emperor and cobbler be cast in the same mould the weight and importance of the action of prince consider we persuade ourselves that they must be produce by some a weighty and important cause but we be deceive for they be push on and pull back in their motion by the same spring that we be in our little undertakings the same reason that make u wrangle with a neighbour cause a war betwixt princes the same reason that make u whip a lackey fall into the hand of a king make him ruin a whole province they be a lightly move a we but they be able to do more in a gnat and an elephant the passion be the same a to fidelity there be no animal in the world so treacherous a man our history have record the violent pursuits that dog have make after the murderer of their master king pyrrhus observe a dog that watch a dead man body and understanding that he have for three day together perform that office command that the body should be bury and take the dog along with him one day a he be at a general muster of hi army this dog see hi master murderer with great barking and extreme sign of anger fly upon them and by this first accusation awaken the revenge of this murder which be soon after perfect by form of justice a much be do by the dog of the wise hesiod who convict the son of ganictor of naupactus of the murder commit on the person of hi master another dog be to guard a temple at athens have spy a sacrilegious thief carry away the fine jewel fell to bark at him with all hi force but the warder not awake at the noise he follow him and day be break keep off at a little distance without lose sight of him if he offer him any thing to eat he would not take it but would wag hi tail at all the passenger he meet and take whatever they give him and if the thief lay down to sleep he likewise stay upon the same place the news of this dog be come to the warder of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit inquiring of the colour of the dog and at last find him in the city of cromyon and the thief also whom they bring back to athens where he get hi reward and the judge in consideration of this good office order a certain measure of corn for the dog daily sustenance at the public charge and the priest to take care of it plutarch deliver this story for a certain truth and that it happen in the age wherein he live a to gratitude for i think we need bring this word into a little repute this one example which apion report himself to have be an eyewitness of shall suffice one day say he at rome they entertain the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beast and principally of lion of an unusual size there be one amongst the rest who by hi furious deportment by the strength and largeness of hi limb and by hi loud and dreadful roaring attract the eye of all the spectator amongst other slave that be present to the people in this combat of beast there be one androdus of dacia belong to a roman lord of consular dignity this lion have see him at a distance first make a sudden stop a it be in a wondering posture and then softly approach nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner a if it be to enter into acquaintance with him this be do and be now assure of what he seek for he begin to wag hi tail a dog do when they flatter their master and to kiss and lick the hand and thigh of the poor wretch who be beside himself and almost dead with fear androdus be by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself and have take so much heart a to consider and know him it be a singular pleasure to see the joy and caress that pass betwixt them at which the people break into loud acclamation of joy the emperor cause the slave to be call to know from him the cause of so strange an event who thereupon tell him a new and a very strange story my master say he be proconsul in africa i be constrain by hi severity and cruel usage be daily beat to steal from him and run away and to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province i think it my best way to fly to the solitude sand and uninhabitable part of that country resolve that in case the mean of support life should chance to fail me to make some shift or other to kill myself the sun be excessively hot at noon and the heat intolerable i light upon a private and almost inaccessible cave and go into it soon after there come in to me this lion with one foot wound and bloody complaining and groan with the pain he endure at hi come i be exceed afraid but he have spy me hid in the comer of hi den come gently to me hold out and show me hi wounded foot a if he demand my assistance in hi distress i then draw out a great splinter he have get there and grow a little more familiar with him squeeze the wound thrust out the matter dirt and gravel which be get into it and wipe and cleanse it the best i could he find himself something well and much ease of hi pain lay him down to rest and presently fell asleep with hi foot in my hand from that time forward he and i live together in this cave three whole year upon one and the same diet for of the beast that he kill in hunt he always bring me the best piece which i roast in the sun for want of fire and so eat it at last grow weary of this wild and brutish life the lion be one day go abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision i depart thence and the third day after be take by the soldier who bring me from africa to this city to my master who presently condemn me to die and to be thus expose to the wild beast now by what i see this lion be also take soon after who have now seek to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he receive at my hand this be the story that androdus tell the emperor which he also convey from hand to hand to the people wherefore at the general request he be absolve from hi sentence and set at liberty and the lion be by order of the people present to him we afterwards saw say apion androdus lead this lion in nothing but a small leash from tavern to tavern at rome and receive what money every body would give him the lion be so gentle a to suffer himself to be cover with the flower that the people throw upon him every one that meet him say there go the lion that entertain the man there go the man that cure the lion we often lament the loss of beast we love and so do they the loss of u a some nation have their wife in common and some other have every one hi own be not the same see among beast and marriage good keep than ours a to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves to league together and to give one another mutual assistance be it not know that oxen hog and other animal at the cry of any of their kind that we offend all the herd run to hi aid and embody for hi defence the fish scarus when he have swallow the angler hook hi fellow all crowd about him and gnaw the line in piece and if by chance one be get into the bow net the other present him their tail on the outside which he hold fast with hi teeth they after that manner disengage and draw him out mullet when one of their companion be engage cross the line over their back and with a fin they have there indent like a saw cut and saw it asunder a to the particular office that we receive from one another for the service of life there be several like example amongst them ti say that the whale never move that she have not always before her a little fish like the seagudgeon for this reason call the guidefish whom the whale follow suffer himself to be lead and turn with a great facility a the rudder guide the ship in recompense of which service also whereas all the other thing whether beast or vessel that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster mouth be immediately lose and swallow up this little fish retires into it in great security and there sleep during which time the whale never stir but so soon a ever it go out he immediately follow it and if by accident he lose the sight of hi little guide he go wander here and there and strike hi side against the rock like a ship that have lose her helm which plutarch affirm to have see in the island of anticyra there be a like society betwixt the little bird call the wren and the crocodile the wren serve for a sentinel over this great animal and if the ichneumon hi mortal enemy approach to fight him this little bird for fear l he should surprise him asleep both with hi voice and bill rouse him and give him notice of hi danger he feed of this monster leaving who receive him familiarly into hi mouth suffer him to peck in hi jaw and betwixt hi teeth and thence to pick out the bit of flesh that remain and when he have a mind to shut hi mouth he first give the bird warning to go out by close it by little and little and without bruise or do it any harm at all the shellfish call the naker live in the same intelligence with the shrimp a little sort of animal of the lobster kind which serve him in the nature of a porter sit at the opening of the shell which the naker keep always gaping and open till the shrimp see some little fish proper for their prey within the hollow of the shell where she enter too and pinch the naker so to the quick that she be force to close her shell where they two together devour the prey they have trap in their fort in the manner of living of the tunny we observe a singular knowledge of the three part of mathematics a to astrology they teach it men for they stay in the place where they be surprise by the brumal solstice and never stir thence till the next equinox for which reason aristotle himself attribute to them this science a to geometry and arithmetic they always form their number in the figure of a cube every way square and make up the body of a battalion solid close and environ round with six equal side and swim in this square order a large behind a before so that whoever in see them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop by reason that the depth be equal to the breadth and the breadth to the length a to magnanimity it will be hard to exhibit a good instance of it than in the example of the great dog send to alexander the great from the indie they first bring him a stag to encounter next a boar and after that a bear all which he slight and disdain to stir from hi place but when he saw a lion he then immediately rouse himself evidently manifest that he declare that alone worthy to enter the list with him touch repentance and the acknowledgment of fault ti report of an elephant that have in the impetuosity of hi rage kill hi keeper he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat but starve himself to death and a to clemency ti say of a tiger the most cruel of all beast that a kid have be put in to him he suffer a two day hunger rather than hurt it and the third break the grate he be shut up in to seek elsewhere for prey so unwilling he be to fall upon the kid hi familiar and hi guest and a to the law of familiarity and agreement form by conversation it ordinarily happen that we bring up cat dog and hare tame together but that which seaman by experience know and particularly in the sicilian sea of the quality of the halcyon surpass all human thought of what kind of animal have nature even so much honour the birth the poet indeed say that one only island delos which be before a floating island be fix for the service of latona lyingin but god have order that the whole ocean should be stay make stable and smooth without wave without wind or rain whilst the halcyon produce her young which be just about the solstice the short day of the year so that by her privilege we have seven day and seven night in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger their female never have to do with any other male but their own whom they serve and assist all their life without ever forsake him if he become weak and broken with age they take him upon their shoulder and carry him from place to place and serve him till death but the most inquisitive into the secret of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon build her nest for her little one nor guess at the material plutarch who have see and handle many of them think it be the bone of some fish which she join and bind together interlace them some lengthwise and other across and add rib and hoop in such manner that she form at last a round vessel fit to launch which be do and the building finish she carry it to the beach where the sea beat gently against it show where she be to mend what be not well joint and knit and where good to fortify the seam that be leaky that open at the beating of the wave and on the contrary what be well build and have have the due finish the beating of the wave do so close and bind together that it be not to be break or crack by blow either of stone or iron without very much ado and that which be more to be admire be the proportion and figure of the cavity within which be compose and proportion after such a manner a not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that build it for to any thing els it be so impenetrable close and shut nothing can enter not so much a the water of the sea this be a very dear description of this building and borrow from a very good hand and yet methinks it do not give u sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon and disdainfully to interpret effect that we can neither imitate nor comprehend to pursue a little far this equality and correspondence betwixt u and beasts the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon of thing she conceive to her own law of strip all thing that come to her of their mortal and corporeal quality of order and place thing she conceive worthy her take notice of strip and divest them of their corruptible quality and make them to lay aside length breadth depth weight colour smell roughness smoothness hardness softness and all sensible accident a mean and superfluous vestment to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition a rome and paris for example that i have in my fancy paris that i imagine i imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place without stone without plaster and without wood this very same privilege i say seem evidently to be in beast for a courser accustom to trumpet to musketshots and battle whom we see start and tremble in hi sleep and stretch upon hi litter a if he be in a fight it be almost certain that he conceive in hi soul the beat of a drum without noise and an army without arm and without body the hare that a greyhound imago in hi sleep after which we see him pant so whilst he sleep stretch out hi tail shake hi leg and perfectly represent all the motion of a course be a hare without fur and without bone the watchdog that we often observe to snarl in their dream and afterwards bark out and start up as if they perceive some stranger at hand the stranger that their soul discern be a man spiritual and imperceptible without dimension without colour and without be to the beauty of the body before i proceed any further i should know whether or no we be agree about the description ti likely we do not well know what beauty be in nature and in general since to our own human beauty we give so many diver form of which be there any natural rule and prescription we should know it in common a the heat of the fire but we fancy the form accord to our own appetite and like the indian paint it black and tawny with great swelled lip wide flat nose and load the cartilage betwixt the nostril with great ring of gold to make it hang down to the mouth a also the under lip with great hoop enrich with precious stone that weigh them down to fall upon the chin it be with them a singular grace to show their teeth even below the root in peru the great ear be the most beautiful which they stretch out as far a they can by art and a man now live say that he have see in an eastern nation this care of enlarge them in so great repute and the ear load with so ponderous jewel that he do with great ease put hi arm sleeve and all through the hole of an ear there be elsewhere nation that take great care to black their teeth and hate to see them white whilst other paint them red the woman be repute more beautiful not only in biscay but elsewhere for have their head shave and which be more in certain frozen country a pliny report the mexican esteem a low forehead a great beauty and though they shave all other part they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art and have great breast in so great reputation that they affect to give their child suck over their shoulder we should paint deformity so the italian fashion it gross and massy the spaniard gaunt and slender and amongst u one have it white another brown one soft and delicate another strong and vigorous one will have hi mistress soft and gentle other haughty and majestic just a the preference in beauty that plato attribute to the spherical figure the epicurean give rather to the pyramidal or square and can not swallow a god in the form of a bowl but be it how it will nature have no more privileged u in this from her common law than in the rest and if we will judge ourselves aright we shall find that if there be some animal less favour in this than we there be other and in great number that be more a multis animalibus decor vincimur many animal surpass u in beauty even among the terrestrial our compatriot for a to those of sea set the figure aside which can not fall into any manner of proportion be so much another thing in colour clearness smoothness and arrangement we sufficiently give place to them and no less in all quality to the aerial and this prerogative that the poet make such a mighty matter of our erect stature look towards heaven our original be truly poetical for there be several little beast who have their sight absolutely turn towards heaven and i find the gesture of camel and ostrich much high raise and more erect than ours what animal have not their face above and not before and do not look opposite a we do and that do not in their natural posture discover a much of heaven and earth a man and what quality of our bodily constitution in plato and cicero may not indifferently serve a thousand sort of beast those that most resemble u be the most despicable and deform of all the herd for those a to outward appearance and form of visage be baboon a to the internal and vital part the hog in earnest when i consider man stark naked even in that sex which seem to have great share of beauty hi defect natural subjection and imperfection i find that we have more reason than any other animal to cover ourselves and be to be excuse from borrowing of those to whom nature have in this be kind than to u to trick ourselves out with their beauty and hide ourselves under their spoil their wool feather hair and silk let u observe a to the rest that man be the sole animal whose nudity offend hi own companion and the only one who in hi natural action withdraws and hide himself from hi own kind and really tis also an effect worth consideration that they who be master in the trade prescribe a a remedy for amorous passion the full and free view of the body a man desire for that to cool the ardour there need no more but freely and fully to see what he love and although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour it be notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiency that use and acquaintance should make u disgust one another it be not modesty so much a cunning and prudence that make our lady so circumspect to refuse u admittance into their cabinet before they be paint and trick up for the public view whereas in several animal there be nothing that we do not love and that do not please our sens so that from their very excrement we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauce but also our richest ornament and perfume this discourse reflect upon none but the ordinary sort of woman and be not so sacrilegious a to comprehend those divine supernatural and extraordinary beauty which we see shine occasionally among u like star under a corporeal and terrestrial veil a to the rest the very share that we allow to beast of the bounty of nature by our own confession be very much to their advantage we attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good future and absent good for which human capacity can not of herself be responsible or good that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion a reason knowledge and honour and leave to them for their dividend essential durable and palpable good a peace repose security innocence and health health i say the fair and richest present that nature can make u insomuch that philosophy even the stoic be so bold a to say that heraclitus and pherecides could they have truck their wisdom for health and have deliver themselves the one of hi dropsy and the other of the lousy disease that torment him they have do well by which they set a great value upon wisdom comparing and put it into the balance with health than they do with this other proposition which be also theirs they say that if circe have present ulysses with the two potion the one to make a fool become a wise man and the other to make a wise man become a fool that ulysses ought rather to have choose the last than consent to that by which circe change hi human figure into that of a beast and say that wisdom itself would have speak to him after this manner forsake me let me alone rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an as how the philosopher then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial cover it be then no more by reason by discourse and by the soul that we excel beast ti by our beauty our fair complexion and our fine symmetry of part for which we must quit our intelligence our prudence and all the rest well i accept this open and free confession certainly they know that those part upon which we so much value ourselves be no other than vain fancy if beast then have all the virtue knowledge wisdom and stoical perfection they would still be beast and would not be comparable to man miserable wicked mad man for in short whatever be not a we be be nothing worth and god to procure himself an esteem among u must put himself into that shape a we shall show anon by which it appear that it be not upon any true ground of reason but by a foolish pride and vain opinion that we prefer ourselves before other animal and separate ourselves from their society and condition but to return to what i be upon before we have for our part inconstancy irresolution incertitude sorrow superstition solicitude of thing to come even after we shall be no more ambition avarice jealousy envy irregular frantic and untamed appetite war lie disloyalty detraction and curiosity doubtless we have strangely overpay this fine reason upon which we so much glorify ourselves and this capacity of judging and know if we have buy it at the price of this infinite number of passion to which we be eternally subject unless we shall also think fit a even socrates do to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beast that whereas nature have prescribe them certain season and limit for the delight of venus she have give u the rein at all hour and all season ut vinum ogrotis quia prodest rar nocet sopissime melius est non adhibere omnino quam spe dubio salutis in apertam perniciem incurrere sic haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi

wine often hurt the sick and very rarely do them good it be well not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit so i know not whether it have not be well for mankind that this quick motion this penetration this subtlety that we call reason have not be give to man at all consider how pestiferous it be to many and useful but to few than to have be confer in so abundant manner and with so liberal a hand of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many thing be to yarro and aristotle did it exempt them from human inconvenience be they by it free from the accident that lay heavy upon the shoulder of a porter did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout or for know how this humour be lodge in the joint do they feel it the less did they enter into composition with death by know that some nation rejoice at hi approach or with cuckoldry by know that in some part of the world wife be in common on the contrary have be repute the great men for knowledge the one amongst the roman and the other amongst the greek and in a time when learn do most flourish we have not hear nevertheless that they have any particular excellence in their life nay the greek have enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemish in hi have we observe that pleasure and health have a good relish with him that understand astrology and grammar than with other or shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last i have know in my time a hundred artisans a hundred labourer wiser and more happy than the rector of the university and whom i have much rather have resemble learning methinks have it place amongst the necessary thing of life a glory nobility dignity or at the most a beauty rich and such other quality which indeed be useful to it but remotely and more by opinion than by nature we stand very little more in need of office rule and law of living in our society than crane and ant do in theirs and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition if man be wise he would take the true value of every thing accord a it be useful and proper to hi life whoever will number u by our action and deportment will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned aye in all sort of virtue old rome seem to me to have be of much great value both for peace and war than that learn rome that ruin itself and though all the rest should be equal yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancient for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity but i will leave this discourse that would lead me farther than i be willing to follow and shall only say this further ti only humility and submission that can make a complete good man we be not to leave the knowledge of hi duty to every man own judgment we be to prescribe it to him and not suffer him to choose it at hi own discretion otherwise accord to the imbecility and infinite variety of our reason and opinion we should at large forge ourselves duty that would a epicurus say enjoin u to eat one another the first law that ever god give to man be a law of pure obedience it be a commandment naked and simple wherein man have nothing to inquire after nor to dispute forasmuch a to obey be the proper office of a rational soul acknowledge a heavenly superior and benefactor from obedience and submission spring all other virtue a all sin do from selfopinion and on the contrary the first temptation that by the devil be offer to human nature it first poison insinuate itself into u by the promise make u of knowledge and wisdom eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum ye shall be a god know good and evil and the siren in homer to allure ulysses and draw him within the danger of their snare offer to give him knowledge the plague of man be the opinion of wisdom and for this reason it be that ignorance be so recommended to u by our religion a proper to faith and obedience cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seduction secundum elementa mundi take heed l any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men and the rudiment of the world there be in this a general consent amongst all sort of philosopher that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body but where shall we find it it seem in truth that nature for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state have only give u presumption for our inheritance ti a epictetus say that man have nothing properly hi own but the use of hi opinion we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion the god have health in essence say philosophy and sickness in intelligence man on the contrary posse hi good by fancy hi ill in essence we have reason to magnify the power of our imagination for all our good be only in dream hear this poor calamitous animal huff there be nothing say cicero so charm a the employment of letter of letter i say by mean whereof the infinity of thing the immense grandeur of nature the heaven even in this world the earth and the sea be discover to u tis they that have teach u religion moderation and the grandeur of courage and that have rescue our soul from darkness to make her see all thing high low first last and middle ti they that furnish u wherewith to live happily and well and conduct u to pass over our life without displeasure and without offence doe not this man seem to speak of the condition of the everliving and almighty god but a to effect a thousand little countrywoman have live life more equal more sweet and constant than hi here be brave ranting word but a very slight accident put this man understand in a bad condition than that of the mean shepherd notwithstanding this instructing god this divine wisdom of the same stamp and impudence be the promise of democritus book i be go to speak of all thing and that foolish title that aristotle prefix to one of hi order only afford him a few lucid interval which he employ in compose hi book and at last make him kill himselfeusebiuss chronicon of the mortal god and the judgment of chrysippus that dion be as virtuous a god and my seneca himself say that god have give him life but that to live well be hi own conformably to this other in virtute vere gloriamur quod non contingeret si id donum deo non nobis haberemus we truly glory in our virtue which would not be if it be give u of god and not by ourselves this be also seneca say that the wise man hath fortitude equal with god but that hi be in spite of human frailty wherein therefore he more than equal god there be nothing so ordinary a to meet with sally of the like temerity there be none of u who take so much offence to see himself equal with god a he do to see himself undervalue by be rank with other creature so much more be we jealous of our own interest than that of our creator but we must trample under foot this foolish vanity and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinion be found so long a man shall believe he have any mean and power of himself he will never acknowledge what he owe to hi maker hi egg shall always be chicken a the say be we must therefore strip him to hi shirt let u see some notable example of the effect of hi philosophy posidonius be torment with a disease so painful a make him writhe hi arm and gnash hi teeth think he sufficiently scorn the dolour by cry out against it thou mayst do thy bad i will not confess that thou art an evil he be a sensible of the pain a my footman but he make a bravado of bridle hi tongue at least and restrain it within the law of hi sect re succumbere non oportebat verbis gloriantem it do not become him that speak so big to confess hi frailty when he come to the test arcesilas be ill of the gout and carneades who have come to see him go away trouble at hi condition he call him back and show him hi foot and breast there be nothing come thence hither say he this have something a good grace for he feel himself in pain and would be disengage from it but hi heart notwithstanding be not conquer nor subdue by it the other stand more obstinately to hi point but i fear rather verbally than really and dionysius heracleotes afflict with a vehement smart in hi eye be reduce to quit these stoical resolution but even though knowledge should in effect do a they say and could blunt the point and dull the edge of the misfortune that attend u what do she more than what ignorance do more purely and evidentlythe philosopher pyrrho be at sea in very great danger by reason of a mighty storm present nothing to the imitation of those who be with him in that extremity but a hog they have on board that be fearless and unconcerned at the tempest philosophy when she have say all she can refer u at last to the example of a gladiator wrestler or muleteer in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death sense of pain and other inconvenience and more of endurance than ever knowledge furnish any one withal that be not bom and breed to hardship what be the cause that we make incision and cut the tender limb of an infant and those of a horse more easily than our ownbut ignorance only how many have mere force of imagination make sick we often see men cause themselves to be let blood purge and physicked to be cure of disease they only feel in opinionwhen real infirmity fail u knowledge lend u hers that colour that complexion portend some catarrh defluxion this hot season threaten u with a fever this breach in the lifeline of your left hand give you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition and at last she roundly attack health itself say this sprightliness and vigour of youth can not continue in this posture there must be blood take and the heat abate l it turn against yourself compare the life of a man subject to such imagination to that of a labourer that suffer himself to be lead by hi natural appetite measure thing only by the present sense without knowledge and without prognostic that feel no pain or sickness but when he be really ill whereas the other have the stone in hi soul before he have it in hi bladder a if it be not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come he must anticipate it by fancy and run to meet it what i say of physic may generally serve in example for all other science thence be derive that ancient opinion of the philosopher that place the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment my ignorance affords me a much occasion of hope a of fear and have no other rule for my health than that of the example of other and of event i see elsewhere upon the like occasion i find of all sort and rely upon those which by comparison be most favourable to me i receive health with open arm free full and entire and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it by how much it be at present less ordinary and more rare so far be i from trouble it repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living beast sufficiently show u how much the agitation of our mind bring infirmity and disease upon u that which be told u of those of brazil that they never die but of old age be attribute to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in but i rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their soul free from all passion think or employment extend or unpleasing a people that pass over their life in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance without letter without law without king or any manner of religion and whence come that which we find by experience that the heavy and dull men be most able and the most to be desire in amorous performance and that the love of a muleteer often render itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturb hi physical ability dissolve and tire it a it also ordinarily trouble and tire itself what put the soul beside itself and more usually throw it into madness but her own promptness vigour and agility and finally her own proper force of what be the most subtle folly make but of the most subtle wisdom a great friendship spring from great enmity and vigorous health from mortal disease so from the rare and vivid agitation of our soul proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzy tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other in the action of madman we see how infinitely madness resemble the most vigorous operation of the soul who do not know how indiscernible the difference be betwixt folly and the sprightly elevation of a free soul and the effect of a supreme and extraordinary virtue plato say that melancholy person be the most capable of discipline and the most excellent and accordingly in none be there so great a propension to madness great wit be ruin by their own proper force and pliability into what a condition through hi own agitation and promptness of fancy be one of the most judicious ingenious and near form of any other italian poet to the air of the ancient and true poesy lately fall ha he not vast obligation to this vivacity that have destroy him to this light that have blind him to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that have put him beside hi own to this curious and laborious search after science that have reduce him to imbecility and to this rare aptitude to the exercise of the soul that have render him without exercise and without soul i be more angry if possible than compassionate to see him at ferrara in so pitiful a condition survive himself forget both himself and hi work which without hi knowledge though before hi face have be publish unformed and incorrect would you have a man healthy would you have him regular and in a steady and secure posture muffle him up in the shade of stupidity and sloth we must be make beast to be make wise and hoodwink before we be fit to be lead and if one shall tell me that the advantage of have a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils brings this disadvantage along with it to render u consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure this be true but the misery of our condition be such that we have not so much to enjoy a to avoid and that the extreme pleasure do not affect u to the degree that a light grief do segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt we be not so sensible of the most perfect health a we be of the least sickness our wellbeing be nothing but the not be ill which be the reason why that sect of philosopher which set the great value upon pleasure have yet fix it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain to be free from ill be the great good that man can hope for or desire a ennius say for that every tickling and sting which be in certain pleasure and that seem to raise u above simple health and passiveness that active moving and i know not how itching and biting pleasure even that very pleasure itself aim at nothing but insensibility a it mark the appetite that carry u headlong to womens embrace have no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desire and only require to be glut and lay at rest and deliver from the fever and so of the rest i say then that if simplicity conduct u to a state free from evil she lead u to a very happy one accord to our condition and yet we be not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility a to be totally without sense for crantor have very good reason to controvert the insensibility of epicurus if found so deep that the very first attack and birth of evil be not to be perceive i do not approve such an insensibility a be neither possible nor to be desire i be very well content not to be sick but if i be i would know that i be so and if a caustic be apply or incision make in any part i would feel them in truth whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure and finally annihilate man himself istud nihil dolere non sine magn mercede contingit immanitatis in animo stuporis in corpore an insensibility that be not to be purchase but at the price of inhumanity in the soul and of stupidity of the body evil appertain to man of course neither be pain always to be avoid nor pleasure always pursue ti a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throw u into it arm when she find herself puzzle to fortify u against the weight of evil she be constrain to come to this composition to give u the rein and permit u to fly into the lap of the other and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the stroke and injury of fortune for what els be her mean when she instruct u to divert our thought from the ill that press upon u and entertain them with the meditation of pleasure past and go to comfort ourselves in present affliction with the remembrance of fled delight and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction to oppose it to the discomfort that lie heavy upon u levationes gritudinum in avocation a cogitand molesti et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates ponit he direct u to alleviate our grief and pain by reject unpleasant thought and recall agreeable idea if it be not that where her power fail she would supply it with policy and make use of sleight of hand where force of limb will not serve her turn for not only to a philosopher but to any man in hi right wit when he have upon him the thirst of a burning fever what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he take in drinking greek wine a month ago it would rather only make matter bad to him of the same stamp be this other counsel that philosophy give only to remember the happiness that be past and to forget the misadventure we have undergo a if we have the science of oblivion in our own power and counsel wherein we be yet no more to seek how do philosophy that should arm me to contend with fortune and steel my courage to trample all human adversity under foot arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shift for the memory represent to u not what we choose but what she please nay there be nothing that so much imprint any thing in our memory a a desire to forget it and tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it and this be false est situm in nobis ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivion obruamus et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus it be in our power to bury a it be in a perpetual oblivion all adverse accident and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our success and this be true memini etiam quo nolo oblivisci non possum quo volo i do also remember what i would not but i can not forget what i would and whose counsel be this hi qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus who alone durst profess himself a wise man to empty and disfurnish the memory be not this the true way to ignorance we find several other like precept whereby we be permit to borrow frivolous appearance from the vulgar where we find the strong reason will not answer the purpose provide they administer satisfaction and comfort where they can not cure the wound they be content to palliate and benumb it i believe they will not deny this that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment they would accept it there would be a great many philosopher of lycass mind this man be otherwise of very regular manner live quietly and contentedly in hi family and not fail in any office of hi duty either towards hi own or stranger and very carefully preserve himself from hurtful thing become nevertheless by some distemper in hi brain possess with a conceit that he be perpetually in the theatre a spectator of the fine sight and the best comedy in the world and be cure by the physician of hi frenzy be hardly prevent from endeavour by suit to compel them to restore him again to hi please imagination with a madness like that of thrasylaus the son of pythodorus who make himself believe that all the ship that weigh anchor from the port of pirus and that come into the haven only make their voyage for hi profit congratulate them upon their successful navigation and receive them with the great joy and when hi brother crito cause him to be restore to hi better understanding he infinitely regret that sort of condition wherein he have live with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind ti accord to the old greek verse that there be a great deal of convenience in not be overwise and ecclesiastes in much wisdom there be much sorrow and who get wisdom get labour and trouble even that to which philosophy consent in general that last remedy which she apply to all sort of necessity to put an end to the life we be not able to endure placetpare non placetqucumque vi exi pungit dolorvel fodiat sane si nudus e da jugulum sin tectus armis vulcaniis id est fortitudine rsist do it pleaseobey it not pleasego where thou wilt doe grief prick theenay stab theeif thou art naked present thy throat if cover with the arm of vulcan that be fortitude resist it and this word so use in the greek festival aut bibat aut abeat either drink or go which sound well upon the tongue of a gascon who naturally change the h into v than on that of cicero what be it other than a confession of hi impotency and a send back not only to ignorance to be there in safety but even to stupidity insensibility and nonentity ti what antisthenes say that a man should either make provision of sense to understand or of a halter to hang himself and what chrysippus allege upon this saying of the poet tyrtus and crate say that love would be cure by hunger if not by time and whoever dislike these two remedy by a rope that sextius of whom both seneca and plutarch speak with so high an encomium have apply himself all other thing set aside to the study of philosophy resolve to throw himself into the sea see the progress of hi study too tedious and slow he run to find death since he could not overtake knowledge these be the word of the law upon the subject if peradventure some great inconvenience happen for which there be no remedy the haven be near and a man may save himself by swim out of hi body a out of a leaky skiff for ti the fear of die and not the love of life that tie the fool to hi body a life render itself by simplicity more pleasant so more innocent and good also it render it a i be say before the simple and ignorant say st paul raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it and we with all our knowledge plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss i be neither sway by valentinian a professed enemy to all learning and letter nor by licinius both roman emperor who call them the poison and pest of all political government nor by mahomet who a ti say interdict all manner of learn to hi follower but the example of the great lycurgus and hi authority with the reverence of the divine lacedemonian policy so great so admirable and so long flourish in virtue and happiness without any institution or practice of letter ought certainly to be of very great weight such a return from the new world discover by the spaniard in our father day testify to u how much more honestly and regularly those nation live without magistrate and without law than ours do where there be more officer and lawyer than there be of other sort of men and business it be what a roman senator of the latter age say that their predecessor breath stunk of garlic but their stomach be perfume with a good conscience and that on the contrary those of hi time be all sweet odour without but stink within of all sort of vice that be to say a i interpret it that they abound with learning and eloquence but be very defective in moral honesty incivility ignorance simplicity roughness be the natural companion of innocence curiosity subtlety knowledge bring malice in their train humility fear obedience and affability which be the principal thing that support and maintain human society require an empty and docile soul and little presuming upon itself christian have a particular knowledge how natural and original an evil curiosity be in man the thirst of knowledge and the desire to become more wise be the first ruin of man and the way by which he precipitate himself into eternal damnation pride be hi ruin and corruption ti pride that divert him from the common path and make him embrace novelty and rather choose to be head of a troop lose and wander in the path of error to be a master and a teacher of lie than to be a disciple in the school of truth suffer himself to be lead and guide by the hand of another in the right and beat road ti peradventure the meaning of this old greek say that superstition follow pride and obey it a if it be a father ah presumption how much dost thou hinder u after that socrates be tell that the god of wisdom have assign to him the title of sage he be astonish at it and search and examine himself throughout could find no foundation for this divine judgment he know other a just temperate valiant and learn a himself and more eloquent more handsome and more profitable to their country than he at last he conclude that he be not distinguish from other nor wise but only because he do not think himself so and that hi god consider the opinion of knowledge and wisdom a a singular absurdity in man and that hi best doctrine be the doctrine of ignorance and simplicity hi best wisdom the sacred word declare those miserable among u who have an opinion of themselves dust and ash say it to such what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself and in another place god have make man like unto a shadow of whom who can judge when by remove the light it shall be vanish man be a thing of nothing our force be so far from be able to comprehend the divine height that of the work of our creator those best bear hi mark and be with good title hi which we the least understand to meet with an incredible thing be an occasion to christian to believe and it be so much the more accord to reason by how much it be against human reason if it be accord to reason it would be no more a miracle and if it be accord to example it would be no longer a singular thing melius scitur deus nesdendo god be well know by not know him say st austin and tacitus sanctius est ac reverentius de actis deorum credere quam scire it be more holy and reverent to believe the work of god than to know them and plato think there be something of impiety in inquire too curiously into god the world and the first cause of thing atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire difficile et quum jam inveneris indicare in vulgtis nefas to find out the parent of the world be very difficult and when find out to reveal him to the vulgar be sin say cicero we talk indeed of power truth justice which be word that signify some great thing but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all we say that god fear that god be angry that god love these be all agitation and emotion that can not be in god accord to our form nor can we imagine them accord to hi it only belong to god to know himself and to interpret hi own work and he do it in our language go out of himself to stoop to u who grovel upon the earth how can prudence which be the choice between good and evil be properly attribute to him whom no evil can touch how can reason and intelligence which we make use of to arrive by obscure at apparent thing see that nothing be obscure to him how justice which distribute to every one what appertain to him a thing begot by the society and community of men how be that in god how temperance which be the moderation of corporal pleasure that have no place in the divinity fortitude to support pain labour and danger a little appertains to him a the rest these three thing have no access to him for which reason aristotle hold him equally exempt from virtue and vice neque gratia neque ira teneri potest quod quo talia essent imbecilla essent omnia he can neither be affect with favour nor indignation because both these be the effect of frailty the participation we have in the knowledge of truth such a it be be not acquire by our own force god have sufficiently give u to understand that by the witness he have choose out of the common people simple and ignorant men that he have be please to employ to instruct u in hi admirable secret our faith be not of our own acquire ti purely the gift of anothers bounty ti not by meditation or by virtue of our own understanding that we have acquire our religion but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment do more assist u than any force of it and our blindness more than our clearness of sight ti more by the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom ti no wonder if our natural and earthly part can not conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge let u bring nothing of our own but obedience and subjection for a it be write i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where be the wise where be the scribe where be the disputer of this world hath not god make foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world know not god it please god by the foolishness of preach to save them that believe finally should i examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seek and if that quest wherein he have busy himself so many age have enrich him with any new force or any solid truth i believe he will confess if he speak from hi conscience that all he have get by so long inquiry be only to have learn to know hi own weakness we have only by a long study confirm and verify the natural ignorance we be in before the same have fall out to men truly wise which befall the ear of corn they shoot and raise their head high and pert whilst empty but when full and swell with grain in maturity begin to flag and droop so men have try and sound all thing and have find in that mass of knowledge and provision of so many various thing nothing solid and firm and nothing but vanity have quit their presumption and acknowledge their natural condition ti what velleius reproach cotta withal and cicero that they have learn of philo that they have learn nothing pherecydes one of the seven sage write to thales upon hi deathbed i have say he give order to my people after my interment to carry my writing to thee if they please thee and the other sage publish if not suppress them they contain no certainty with which i myself be satisfied neither do i pretend to know the truth or to attain to it i rather open than discover thing the wise man that ever be be ask what he know make answer he know this that he know nothing by which he verify what have be say that the great part of what we know be the least of what we do not that be to say that even what we think we know be but a piece and a very little one of our ignorance we know thing in dream say plato and be ignorant of them in truth ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci nihil percipi nihil sciri posse dixerunt angustos sensus imbecilles animos brevia curriculum vito almost all the ancient have declare that there be nothing to be know nothing to be perceive or understand the sens be too limited men mind too weak and the course of life too short and of cicero himself who stand indebted to hi learn for all he be worth valerius say that he begin to disrelish letter in hi old age and when at hi study it be with great independency upon any one party follow what he think probable now in one sect and then in another evermore waver under the doubt of the academy dicendum est sed ita ut nihil affirment quceram omnia dubitans plerumque et mihi diffidens something i must say but so a to affirm nothing i inquire into all thing but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself i should have too fair a game should i consider man in hi common way of living and in gross yet i might do it by hi own rule who judge truth not by weight but by the number of vote let u set the people aside who neither feel nor judge and let most of their natural faculty lie idle i will take man in hi high ground let u consider him in that little number of men excellent and cull out from the rest who have be endow with a remarkable and particular natural force have moreover harden and whet it by care study and art and raise it to the high pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive they have adjust their soul to all way and all bias have prop and support them with all foreign help proper for them and enrich and adorn them with all they could borrow for their advantage both within and without the world ti in these be place the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain they have regulate the world with policy and law they have instruct it with art and science and by the example of their admirable manner i shall make account of none but such men a these their testimony and experience let u examine how far they have proceed and where they stop the error and defect that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow a their own whoever go in search of any thing must come to this either to say that he have find it or that it be not to be find or that he be yet upon the search all philosophy be divide into these three kind her design be to seek out truth knowledge and certainty the peripatetic epicurean stoic and other have think they have find it these establish the science we have and have treat of them a of certain knowledge clitomachus carneades and the academic have despair in their search and conclude that truth could not be conceive by our understanding the result of these be weakness and human ignorance this sect have have the most and the most noble follower pyrrho and other skeptic or epechists whose dogma be hold by many of the ancient to be take from homer the seven sage and from archilochus and euripides and to whose number these be added zeno democritus and xenophanes say that they be yet upon the inquiry after truth these conclude that the other who think they have find it out be infinitely deceive and that it be too dare a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason be not able to attain unto it for this establish a standard of our power to know and judge the difficulty of thing be a great and extreme knowledge of which they doubt whether man be capable the ignorance that know itself judge and condemn itself be not an absolute ignorance to be such it must be ignorant of itself so that the profession of the pyrrhonians be to waver doubt and inquire not to make themselves sure of or responsible to themselves for any thing of the three action of the soul imaginative appetitive and consent they receive the two first the last they keep ambiguous without inclination or approbation either of one thing or another so light a it be zeno represent the motion of hi imagination upon these division of the faculty of the soul thus an open and expanded hand signify appearance a hand half shut and the finger a little bending consent a clenched fist comprehension when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer knowledge now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible receive all object without application or consent lead them to their ataraxy which be a peaceable condition of life temperate and exempt from the agitation we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of thing whence spring fear avarice envy immoderate desire ambition pride superstition love of novelty rebellion disobedience obstinacy and the great part of bodily ill nay and by that they be exempt from the jealousy of their discipline for they debate after a very gentle manner they fear no requital in their dispute when they affirm that heavy thing descend they would be sorry to be believe and love tobe contradict to engender doubt and suspense of judgment which be their end they only put forward their proposition to contend with those they think we have in our belief if you take their argument they will a readily maintain the contrary ti all one to them they have no choice if you maintain that snow be black they will argue on the contrary that it be white if you say it be neither the one nor the other they will maintain that it be both if you hold of certain judgment that you know nothing they will maintain that you do yea and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt they will argue against you that you doubt not or that you can not judge and determine that you doubt and by this extremity of doubt which jostle itself they separate and divide themselves from many opinion even of those they have several way maintain both concern doubt and ignorance why shall not they be allow to doubt say they as well a the dogmatist one of whom say green another yellow can any thing be propose to u to grant or deny which it shall not be permit to consider a ambiguous and where other be carry away either by the custom of their country or by the instruction of parent or by accident a by a tempest without judgment and without choice nay and for the most part before the age of discretion to such and such an opinion to the sect whether stoic or epicurean with which they be prepossess enslaved and fast bound a to a thing they can not forsake ad quamcumque disciplinant velut tempest delati ad earn tanquam ad saxum adhorescunt every one cleave to the doctrine he have happen upon a to a rock against which he have be throw by tempest why shall not these likewise be permit to maintain their liberty and consider thing without obligation or slavery hoc liberiores et solutiores quod integra illis est judicandi potestas in this more unconstrained and free because they have the great power of judging be it not of some advantage to be disengage from the necessity that curb other be it not well to remain in suspense than to entangle one self in the innumerable error that human fancy have produce be it not much good to suspend one persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangle and seditious division what shall i choose what you please provide you will choose a very foolish answer but such a one nevertheless a all dogmatism seem to point at and by which we be not permit to be ignorant of what we be ignorant of take the most eminent side that of the great reputation it will never be so sure that you shall not be force to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversary to defend it be it not well to keep out of this hurlyburly you be permit to embrace aristotle opinion of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal a your honour and life and to give the lie to plato thereupon and shall they be interdict to doubt him if it be lawful for pantius to maintain hi opinion about augury dream oracles vaticination of which the stoic make no doubt at all why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all thing that he dare to do in those he have learn of hi master establish by the common consent of the school whereof he be a professor and a member if it be a child that judge he know not what it be if a wise man he be prepossess they have reserve for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle have ease themselves of the care of defence if you strike them they care not provide they strike too and they turn every thing to their own use if they overcome your argument be lame if you theirs if they fall short they verify ignorance if you fall short you do it if they prove that nothing be know tis well if they can not prove it ti also well ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momentum inveniuntur facilius ab utraque part assertio sustineatur that when like sentiment happen pro and con in the same thing the assent may on both side be more easily suspend and they make account to find out with much great facility why a thing be false than why ti true that which be not than that which be and what they do not believe than what they do their way of speaking be i assert nothing it be no more so than so or than neither one nor tother i understand it not appearance be everywhere equal the law of speak pro or con be the same nothing seem true that may not seem false their sacramental word be that be to say i hold i stir not this be the burden of their song and other of like stuff the effect of which be a pure entire perfect and absolute suspension of judgment they make use of their reason to inquire and debate but not to fix and determine whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance a judgment without bias propension or inclination upon any occasion whatever conceive a true idea of pyrrhonism i express this fancy as well a i can by reason that many find it hard to conceive and the author themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely a to what concern the action of life they be in this of the common fashion they yield and give up themselves to their natural inclination to the power and impulse of passion to the constitution of law and custom and to the tradition of art non enim nos deus ista scire sed tantummodo uti voluit for god would not have u know but only use those thing they suffer their ordinary action to be guide by those thing without any dispute or judgment for which reason i can not consent to what be say of pyrrho by those who represent him heavy and immovable lead a kind of savage and unsociable life stand the jostle of cart go upon the edge of precipice and refuse to accommodate himself to the law this be to enhance upon hi discipline he would never make himself a stock or a stone he would show himself a living man discourse reason enjoy all reasonable convenience and pleasure employ and make use of all hi corporal and spiritual faculty in rule and reason the fantastic imaginary and false privilege that man have usurp of lord it ordain and establish he have utterly quit and renounce yet there be no sect but be constrain to permit her sage to follow several thing not comprehend perceive or consent to if he mean to live and if he go to sea he follow that design not know whether hi voyage shall be successful or no and only insist upon the tightness of the vessel the experience of the pilot and the convenience of the season and such probable circumstance after which he be bind to go and suffer himself to be govern by appearance provide there be no express and manifest contrariety in them he have a body he have a soul the sens push them the mind spur them on and although he do not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging and that he perceive that he ought not to engage hi consent consider that there may be some false equal to these true appearance yet do he not for all that fail of carry on the office of hi life with great liberty and convenience how many art be there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge that decide not on true and false and only follow that which seem so there be say they true and false and we have in u wherewith to seek it but not to make it stay when we touch it we be much more prudent in let ourselves be regulate by the order of the world without inquiry a soul clear from prejudice have a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose men that judge and control their judge do never duly submit to them how much more docile and easy to be govern both by the law of religion and civil polity be simple and incurious mind than those overvigilant wit that will still be prate of divine and human cause there be nothing in human invention that carry so great a show of likelihood and utility a this this present man naked and empty confess hi natural weakness fit to receive some foreign force from above unfurnished of human and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge make nought of hi own judgment to give more room to faith neither disbelieve nor establish any dogma against common observance humble obedient disciplinable and studious a sworn enemy of heresy and consequently free himself from vain and irreligious opinion introduce by false sect tis a blank paper prepare to receive such form from the finger of god a he shall please to write upon it the more we resign and commit ourselves to god and the more we renounce ourselves of the great value we be take in good part say ecclesiastes the thing that present themselves to thee a they seem and taste from hand to mouth the rest be out of thy knowledge dominus novit cogitation hominum quoniam van sunt the lord knoweth the heart of men that they be but vanity thus we see that of the three general sect of philosophy two make open profession of doubt and ignorance and in that of the dogmatist which be the third it be easy to discover that the great part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the good effect they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for u a to show u how far they have proceed in their search of truth quam docti jingunt magi quam nrunt which the learn rather feign than know timus be to instruct socrates in what he know of the god the world and men proposes to speak to him a a man to a man and that it be sufficient if hi reason be probable a those of another for that exact reason be neither in hi nor any other mortal hand which one of hi follower have thus imitate ut potero explicabo nec tamen ut pythius apollo certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero sed ut homunculus probabilia conjectur sequens i will as well a i be able explain affirm yet not a the pythian oracle that what i say be fix and certain but like a mere man that follow probability by conjecture and this upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death he have elsewhere translate from the very word of plato si forte de deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes minus id quod habemiis in animo consequimur haud erit mirum oquum est enim meminisse et me qui disseram hominem ess et vos qui judicetis ut si probabilia dicentur nihil ultra requiratis if perchance when we discourse of the nature of god and the world original we can not do it a we desire it will be no great wonder for it be just you should remember that both i who speak and you who be to judge be men so that if probable thing be deliver you shall require and expect no more aristotle ordinarily heap up a great number of other men opinion and belief to compare them with hi own and to let u see how much he have go beyond them and how much nearer he approach to the likelihood of truth for truth be not to be judge by the authority and testimony of other which make epicurus religiously avoid quote them in hi writing this be the prince of all dogmatist and yet we be tell by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt in earnest we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of hi advice it be in effect a pyrrhonism under a resolutive form hear cicero protestation who expound to u anothers fancy by hi own qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est hoc in philosophi ratio contra omnia disserendi nuttamque rem aperte judicandi profecta a socrate repetita ab arcesila conjirmata a gameade usqu ad nostram viget cetatemhi sumus qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta ess dicamus tanta similitudine ut in iis nulla insit cert judicandi et assentiendi nota they who desire to know what we think of every thing be therein more inquisitive than be necessary this practice in philosophy of dispute against every thing and of absolutely conclude nothing begin by socrates repeat by arcesilaus and confirm by cameades have continue in use even to our own time we be they who declare that there be so great a mixture of thing false amongst all that be true and they so resemble one another that there can be in them no certain mark to direct u either to judge or assent why hath not aristotle only but most of the philosopher affect difficulty if not to set a great value upon the vanity of the subject and amuse the curiosity of our mind by give them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick clitomachus affirm that he could never discover by carneadess writing what opinion he be of this be it that make epicurus affect to be abstruse and that procure heraclitus the epithet of difficulty be a coin the learned make use of like juggler to conceal the vanity of their art and which human sottishness easily take for current pay cicero reprehend some of hi friend for give more of their time to the study of astrology logic and geometry than they be really worth say that they be by these divert from the duty of life and more profitable and proper study the cyrenaick philosopher in like manner despise physic and logic zeno in the very beginning of the book of the commonwealth declare all the liberal art of no use chrysippus say that what plato and aristotle have writ concern logic they have only do in sport and by way of exercise and could not believe that they speak in earnest of so vain a thing plutarch say the same of metaphysics and epicurus would have say a much of rhetoric grammar poetry mathematics and natural philosophy except of all the science and socrates of them all except that which treat of manner and of life whatever any one require to be instruct in by him he would ever in the first place demand an account of the condition of hi life present and past which he examine and judge esteem all other learn subsequent to that and supernumerary parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil profuerunt that learn be in small repute with me which nothing profit the teacher themselves to virtue most of the art have be in like manner decry by the same knowledge but they do not consider that it be from the purpose to exercise their wit in those very matter wherein there be no solid advantage a to the rest some have look upon plato a a dogmatist other a a doubter other in some thing the one and in other thing the other socrates the conductor of hi dialogue be eternally upon question and stir up dispute never determine never satisfy and professes to have no other science but that of oppose himself homer their author have equally lay the foundation of all the sect of philosophy to show how indifferent it be which way we should choose ti say that ten several sect spring from plato yet in my opinion never do any instruction halt and stumble if hi do not socrates say that midwife in take upon them the trade of help other to bring forth leave the trade of bring forth themselves and that by the title of a wise man or sage which the god have confer upon him he be disable in hi virile and mental love of the faculty of bring forth content himself to help and assist those that could to open their nature anoint the pass and facilitate their birth to judge of the infant baptize nourish fortify swath and circumcise it exercise and employ hi understanding in the peril and fortune of other it be so with the most part of this third sort of author a the ancient have observe in the writing of anaxagoras democritus parmenides xenophanes and other they have a way of write doubtful in substance and design rather inquire than teach though they mix their style with some dogmatical period be not the same thing see in seneca and plutarch how many contradiction be there to be find if a man pry narrowly into them so many that the reconciling lawyer ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves plato seem to have affect this method of philosophize in dialogue to the end that he might with great decency from several mouth deliver the diversityand variety of hi own fancy it be as well to treat variously of thing a to treat of them conformably and good that be to say more copiously and with great profit let u take example from ourselves judgment be the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking and yet those arrets that our parliament give the people the most exemplary of them and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity principally through the sufficiency of the person act derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion which with them be quotidian and common to every judge a from the dispute and heat of diver and contrary argument that the matter of law and equity will permit and the large field for reprehension that some philosopher have against other be draw from the diversityand contradiction wherein every one of them find himself perplexed either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concern every thing or ignorantly compel by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter which be the meaning of the maxim in a slippery and slide place let u suspend our belief for a euripides say like that which empedocles a if transport with a divine fury and compel by truth often strew here and there in hi writing no no we feel nothing we see nothing all thing be conceal from u there be not one thing of which we can positively say what it be accord to the divine say cogitation mortalium timid et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice for the thought of mortal men be doubtful and our device be but uncertain it be not to be think strange if men despair to overtake what they hunt after have not however lose the pleasure of the chase study be of itself so pleasant an employment and so pleasant that amongst the pleasure the stoic forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind will have it curbed and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge democritus have eat fig at hi table that taste of honey fell presently to consider with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness and to be satisfy in it be about to rise from the table to see the place whence the fig have be gather which hi maid observing and have understand the cause smilingly tell him that he need not trouble himself about that for she have put them into a vessel in which there have be honey he be vex at this discovery and that she have deprive him of the occasion of this inquiry and rob hi curiosity of matter to work upon go thy way say he thou hast do me an injury but for all that i will seek out the cause a if it be natural and would willingly have find out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect this story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represent to u that studious passion that put u upon the pursuit of thing of the acquisition of which we despair plutarch give a like example of some one who would not be satisfy in that whereof he be in doubt that he might not lose the pleasure of inquire into it like the other who would not that hi physician should allay the thirst of hi fever that he might not lose the pleasure of quench it by drink satius est supervacua discere quam nihil ti good to learn more than necessary than nothing at all a in all sort of feed the pleasure of eating be very often single and alone and that what we take which be acceptable to the palate be not always nourish or wholesome so that which our mind extract from science do not cease to be pleasant though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful thus they say the consideration of nature be a diet proper for our mind it raise and elevate u make u disdain low and terrestrial thing by compare them with those that be celestial and high the mere inquisition into great and occult thing be very pleasant even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judge it this be what they profess the vain image of this sickly curiosity be yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge eudoxus wish and beg of the god that he might once see the sun near at hand to comprehend the form greatness and beauty of it even though he should thereby be immediately burn he would at the price of hi life purchase a knowledge of which the use and possession should at the same time be take from him and for this sudden and vanish knowledge lose all the other knowledge he have in present or might afterwards have acquire i can not easily persuade myself that epicurus plato and pytagoras have give u their atom idea and number for current pay they be too wise to establish their article of faith upon thing so disputable and uncertain but in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then be every one of these great men endeavour to present some kind of image or reflection of light and work their brain for invention that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance provide that though false they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur non ex scienti vi these thing every one fancy accord to hi wit and not by any power of knowledge one of the ancient who be reproach that he profess philosophy of which he nevertheless in hi own judgment make no great account make answer that this be truly to philosophize they wish to consider all to balance every thing and find that an employment well suit to our natural curiosity some thing they write for the benefit of public society a their religion and for that consideration it be but reasonable that they should not examine public opinion to the quick that they might not disturb the common obedience to the law and custom of their country plato treat of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough for where he write accord to hi own method he give no certain rule when he play the legislator he borrow a magisterial and positive style and boldly there foists in hi most fantastic invention a fit to persuade the vulgar a impossible to be believe by himself know very well how fit we be to receive all sort of impression especially the most immoderate and preposterous and yet in hi law he take singular care that nothing be sing in public but poetry of which the fiction and fabulous relation tend to some advantageous end it be so easy to imprint all sort of phantasm in human mind that it be injustice not to fee them rather with profitable untruth than with untruths that be unprofitable and hurtful he say very roundly in hi republic that it be often necessary for the benefit of men to deceive them it be very easy to distinguish that some of the sect have more follow truth and the other utility by which the last have gain their reputation ti the misery of our condition that often that which present itself to our imagination for the truest do not appear the most useful to life the bold sect a the epicurean pyrrhonian and the new academic be yet constrain to submit to the civil law at the end of the account there be other subject that they have tumble and toss about some to the right and other to the left every one endeavour right or wrong to give them some kind of colour for have find nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of they be very often force to forge weak and ridiculous conjecture not that they themselves look upon them a any foundation or establish any certain truth but merely for exercise non tam id sensisse quod dicer quam exercere ingnia materio difficult videntur voluisse they seem not so much themselves to have believe what they say a to have have a mind to exercise their wit in the difficulty of the matter and if we do not take it thus how should we palliate so great inconstancy variety and vanity of opinion a we see have be produce by those excellent and admirable men a for example what can be more vain than to imagine to guess at god by our analogy and conjecture to direct and govern him and the world by our capacity and our law and to serve ourselves at the expense of the divinity with what small portion of capacity he have be please to impart to our natural condition and because we can not extend our sight to hi glorious throne to have bring him down to our corruption and our misery of all human and ancient opinion concern religion that seem to me the most likely and most excusable that acknowledge god a an incomprehensible power the original and preserver of all thing all goodness all perfection receiving and take in good part the honour and reverence that man pay him under what method name or ceremony soever this zeal have universally be look upon from heaven with a gracious eye all government have reap fruit from their devotion impious men and action have everywhere have suitable event pagan history acknowledge dignity order justice prodigy and oracle employ for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religion god through hi mercy vouchsafing by these temporal benefit to cherish the tender principle of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason give them of him through the deceiving image of their dream not only deceive and false but impious also and injurious be those that man have forge from hi own invention and of all the religion that st paul find in repute at athens that which they have dedicate to the unknown god seem to him the most to be excuse pythagoras shadow the truth a little more closely judge that the knowledge of this first cause and be of being ought to be indefinite without limitation without declaration that it be nothing els than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection every one amplify the idea accord to the talent of hi capacity but if numa attempt to conform the devotion of hi people to this project to attach them to a religion purely mental without any prefixed object and material mixture he undertake a thing of no use the human mind could never support itself float in such an infinity of inform thought there be require some certain image to be present accord to it own model the divine majesty have thus in some sort suffer himself to be circumscribe in corporal limit for our advantage hi supernatural and celestial sacrament have sign of our earthly condition hi adoration be by sensible office and word for ti man that believe and pray i shall omit the other argument upon this subject but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifix that the picture of our saviour passion that the ornament and ceremonious motion of our church that the voice accommodate to the devotion of our thought and that emotion of the sens do not warm the soul of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect of those to whom they have give a body a necessity require in that universal blindness i should i fancy most incline to those who adore the sun forasmuch a beside this grandeur and beauty of hi ti the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remote distance from u and by that mean so little know that they be pardonable for enter into so great admiration and reverence of it thales who first inquire into this sort of matter believe god to be a spirit that make all thing of water anaximander that the god be always die and enter into life again and that there be an infinite number of world anaximines that the air be god that he be procreate and immense always move anaxagoras the first be of opinion that the description and manner of all thing be conduct by the power and reason of an infinite spirit alcmon give divinity to the sun moon and star and to the soul pythagoras make god a spirit spread over the nature of all thing whence our soul be extract parmenides a circle surround the heaven and support the world by the ardour of light empedocles pronounce the four element of which all thing be compose to be god protagoras have nothing to say whether they be or be not or what they be democritus be one while of opinion that the image and their circuit be god another while the nature that dart out those image and then our science and intelligence plato divide hi belief into several opinion he say in hi timus that the father of the world can not be name in hi law that men be not to inquire into hi be and elsewhere in the very same book he make the world the heaven the star the earth and our souls god admit moreover those which have be receive by ancient institution in every republic xenophon report a like perplexity in socrates doctrine one while that men be not to inquire into the form of god and presently make him maintain that the sun be god and the soul god that there be but one god and then that there be many speusippus the nephew of plato make god a certain power govern all thing and that he have a soul aristotle one while say it be the spirit and another the world one while he give the world another master and another while make god the heat of heaven zenocrates make eight five name amongst the planet the sixth compose of all the fixed star a of so many member the seventh and eighth the sun and moon heraclides ponticus do nothing but float in hi opinion and finally deprive god of sense and make him shift from one form to another and at last say that it be heaven and earth theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst hi fancy attribute the superintend of the world one while to the understand another while to heaven and then to the star strato say that ti nature she have the power of generation augmentation and diminution without form and sentiment zeno say tis the law of nature command good and prohibit evil which law be an animal and take away the accustomed god jupiter juno and vesta diogenes apolloniates that ti air zenophanes make god round see and hear not breathe and have nothing in common with human nature aristo think the form of god to be incomprehensible deprives him of sense and know not whether he be an animal or something els cleanthes one while suppose it to be reason another while the world another the soul of nature and then the supreme heat roll about and environ all perseus zeno disciple be of opinion that men have give the title of god to such a have be useful and have add any notable advantage to human life and even to profitable thing themselves chrysippus make a confused heap of all the precede theory and reckons amongst a thousand form of god that he make the men also that have be deify diagoras and theodoras flatly deny that there be any god at all epicurus make the god shin transparent and perflable lodge a betwixt two fort betwixt two world secure from blow clothe in a human figure and with such member a we have which member be to them of no use trust to your philosophy my master and brag that you have find the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle be here with so many philosophical head the perplexity of so many worldly form have gain this over me that manner and opinion contrary to mine do not so much displease a instruct me nor so much make me proud a they humble me in compare them and all other choice than what come from the express and immediate hand of god seem to me a choice of very little privilege the policy of the world be no less opposite upon this subject than the school by which we may understand that fortune itself be not more variable and inconstant nor more blind and inconsiderate than our reason the thing that be most unknown be most proper to be deify wherefore to make god of ourselves a the ancient do exceed the extreme weakness of understand i would much rather have go along with those who adore the serpent the dog or the ox forasmuch a their nature and be be less know to u and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beast and to attribute to them extraordinary faculty but to have make god of our own condition of whom we ought to know the imperfection and to have attribute to them desire anger revenge marriage generation alliance love jealousy our member and bone our fever and pleasures our death and obsequies this must need have proceed from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding formo otates vestitus omatus noti sunt genus conjugia cognation omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar ti humano nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur accipimus enim deorurn cupiditates cegritudines iracundias their form age clothes and ornament be know their descent marriage and kindred and all adapt to the similitude of human weakness for they be represent to u with anxious mind and we read of the lust sickness and anger of the god a have attribute divinity not only to faith virtue honour concord liberty victory and piety but also to voluptuousness fraud death envy old age misery to fear fever ill fortune and other injury of our frail and transitory life the egyptian with an impudent prudence interdict upon pain of hang that any one should say that their god serapis and isi have formerly be men and yet no one be ignorant that they have be such and their effigy represent with the finger upon the mouth signify say varro that mysterious decree to their priest to conceal their mortal original a it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration pay to them see that man so much desire to equal himself to god he have do well say cicero to have attract those divine condition to himself and draw them down hither below than to send hi corruption and misery up on high but to take it right he have several way do both the one and the other with like vanity of opinion when philosopher search narrowly into the hierarchy of their god and make a great bustle about distinguish their alliance office and power i can not believe they speak a they think when plato describe pluto orchard to u and the bodily convenience or pain that attend u after the ruin and annihilation of our body and accommodate them to the feeling we have in this life when mahomet promise hi follower a paradise hung with tapestry gild and enamel with gold and precious stone furnish with wench of excel beauty rare wine and delicate dish it be easily discern that these be deceiver that accommodate their promise to our sensuality to attract and allure u by hope and opinion suitable to our mortal appetite and yet some amongst u be fall into the like error promise to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life accompany with all sort of worldly convenience and pleasure can we believe that plato he who have such heavenly conception and be so well acquaint with the divinity a thence to derive the name of the divine plato ever think that the poor creature man have any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power and that he believe that the weak hold we be able to take be capable or the force of our understanding sufficient to participate of beatitude or eternal pain we should then tell him from human reason if the pleasure thou dost promise u in the other life be of the same kind that i have enjoy here below this have nothing in common with infinity though all my five natural sens should be even load with pleasure and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire we know what all this amount to all this would be nothing if there be any thing of mine there there be nothing divine if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition it can not be of any value all contentment of mortal be mortal even the knowledge of our parent child and friend if that can affect and delight u in the other world if that still continue a satisfaction to u there we still remain in earthly and finite convenience we can not a we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promise if we could in any sort conceive them to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable inexplicable and incomprehensible and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience eye hath not see saith st paul nor ear heard neither hath enter into the heart of man the thing that god hath prepare for them that love him and if to render u capable our be be reform and change a thou plato sayest by thy purification it ought to be so extreme and total a change that by physical doctrine it be no more u for in pythagoras metempsychosis and the change of habitation that he imagine in soul can we believe that the lion in whom the soul of csar be enclose do espouse csars passion or that the lion be he for if it be still csar they would be in the right who controvert this opinion with plato reproach him that the son might be see to ride hi mother transform into a mule and the like absurdity and can we believe that in the mutation that be make of the body of animal into other of the same kind the new comer be not other than their predecessor from the ash of a phoenix a worm they say be engender and from that another phoenix who can imagine that this second phoenix be no other than the first we see our silkworm a it be die and wither and from this wither body a butterfly be produce and from that another worm how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this be still the first that which once have cease to be be no more and plato when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concern in the fruition of the recompense of another life thou tellest u a thing wherein there be as little appearance of truth for by this account it would no more be man nor consequently u who would be concern in this enjoyment for we be compose of two principal essential part the separation of which be the death and ruin of our be we can not say that the man suffer when the worm fee upon hi member and that the earth consume them moreover upon what foundation of their justice can the god take notice of or reward man after hi death and virtuous action since it be themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them and why should they be offend at or punish him for wicked one since themselves have create in him so frail a condition and when with one glance of their will they might prevent him from fall might not epicurus with great colour of human reason object this to plato do he not often save himself with this sentence that it be impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal she do nothing but err throughout but especially when she meddle with divine thing who do more evidently perceive this than we for although we have give her certain and infallible principle and though we have enlighten her step with the sacred lamp of truth that it have please god to communicate to u we daily see nevertheless that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path and that she stray from or wander out of the way set out and beat by the church how soon she lose confounds and fetter herself tumble and float in this vast turbulent and wave sea of human opinion without restraint and without any determinate end so soon a she lose that great and common road she enter into a labyrinth of a thousand several path man can not be any thing but what he be nor imagine beyond the reach of hi capacity ti a great presumption say plutarch in them who be but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the god and demigod than it be in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of sing or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arm and martial affair presume by some light conjecture to understand the effect of an art he be totally a stranger to antiquity i believe think to put a compliment upon and to add something to the divine grandeur in assimilate it to man invest it with hi faculty and adorn it with hi ugly humour and most shameful

music with festoon and nosegay and to accommodate it to our vicious passion flatter it justice with inhuman vengeance and with the ruin and dissipation of thing by it create and preserve a tiberius sempronius who burn the rich spoil and arm he have gain from the enemy in sardinia for a sacrifice to vulcan and paulus milius those of macedonia to mar and minerva and alexander arrive at the indian

rest be commonly use to do and i believe there be no nation under the sun that have not do the same the get hold themselves to be immortal and that their death be nothing but a journey to their god zamolxis every five year they dispatch some one among them to him to entreat of him such necessary a they stand in need of this envoy be choose by lot and the form of dispatch him after he have be

immolate their own child to saturn and those who have none of their own bought of other the father and mother be in the mean time oblige to assist at the ceremony with a gay and content countenance it be a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our affliction like the lacedemonians who regale their diana with the tormenting of young boy whom they cause to be whip for her sake very often to death it be a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of hi building and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punish the innocent and that poor iphigenia at the port of aulis should by her death and immolation acquit towards god the whole army of the greek from all the crime they have commit and that the two noble and generous soul of the two decii the father and the son to incline the favour of the god to be propitious to the affair of rome should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas ut placari populo romano non possent nisi tale viri occidissent how great an injustice in the god be it that they could not be reconcile to the people of rome unless such men perish to which may be add that it be not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourge accord to hi own measure nor at hi own time but that it purely belong to the judge who consider nothing a chastisement but the penalty that he appoint and can not call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffer the divine vengeance presuppose an absolute dissent in u both for it justice and for our own

he have into the sea believe that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribe and satisfy the revolution and vicissitude of fortune and she to mock hi folly order it so that the same jewel come again into hi hand find in the belly of a fish and then to what end be those tearing and dismemberment of the corybantes the menades and in our time of the mahometans who slash their face bosom and

men be not so cruel a to approve the use of this natural contexture have not only respect to u but also to the service of god and other men tis a unjust for u voluntarily to wind or hurt it a to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever it seem to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon and to destroy the function of the body that be stupid and servile to spare the soul the

to unman himself so do they fill their religion with several ill effect now nothing of ours can in any sort be compare or liken unto the divine nature which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection how can that infinite beauty power and goodness admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject thing a we be without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to hi divine greatness

all when it please him and in truth why almighty a he be should he have limit hi power within any certain bound in favour of whom should he have renounce hi privilege thy reason have in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuade thee that there be a plurality of world the most eminent mind of elder time believe it and some of this age of ours compel by the appearance of human reason do the same forasmuch a in this fabric that we behold there be nothing single and one and that all the kind be multiply in some number by which it seem not to be likely that god should have make this work only without a companion and that the matter of this form should have be totally drain in this individual especially if it be a living creature which it motion render so credible that plato affirm it and that many of our people do either confirm or dare not deny it no more than that ancient opinion that the heaven the star and other member of the world be creature compose of body and soul mortal in respect of their composition but immortal by the determination of the creator now if there be many world a democritus epicurus and almost all philosophy have believe what do we know that the principle and rule of this of ours in like manner concern the rest they may peradventure have another form and another polity epicurus suppose them either like or unlike we see in this world an infinite difference and variety only by distance of place neither com wine nor any of our animal be to be see in that new comer of the world discover by our father tis all there another thing and in time past do but consider in how many part of the world they have no knowledge either of bacchus or cere if pliny and herodotus be to be believe there be in certain place kind of men very little resemble u mongrel and ambiguous form betwixt the human and brutal nature there be country where men be bom without head have their mouth and eye in their breast where they be all hermaphrodite where they go on all four where they have but one eye in the forehead and a head more like a dog than like ours where they be half fish the low part and live in the water where the woman bear at five year old and live but eight where the head and the skin of the forehead be so hard that a sword will not touch it but rebound again where men have no beard nation that know not the use of fire other that eject seed of a black colour what shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolf colt and then into men again and if it be true a plutarch say that in some place of the indie there be men without mouth who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odour how many of our description be false he be no longer risible nor perhaps capable of reason and society the disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose and of no use moreover how many thing be there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rule we have cut out for and prescribe to nature and yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto god himself how many thing do we call miraculous and contrary to nature this be do by every nation and by every man accord to the proportion of hi ignorance how many occult property and quintessence do we daily discover for for u to go accord to nature be no more but to go accord to our understanding as far a that be able to follow and as far a we be able to see into it all beyond that be forsooth monstrous and irregular now by this account all thing shall be monstrous to the wise and most understanding men for human reason have persuade them that there be no manner of ground nor foundation not so much a to be assure that snow be white and anaxagoras affirm it to be black if there be any thing or if there be nothing if there be knowledge or ignorance which metrodorus of chios deny that man be able to determine or whether we live a euripides doubt whether the life we live be life or whether that we call death be not life and not without some appearance for why do we derive the title of be from this instant which be but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition death possess all the before and after this moment and also a good part of the moment itself other swear there be no motion at all a follower of melissus and that nothing stir for if there be but one neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him nor motion from one place to another a plato prove that there be neither generation nor corruption in nature protagoras say that there be nothing in nature but doubt that a man may equally dispute of all thing and even of this whether a man can equally dispute of all thing nausiphanes that of thing which seem to be nothing be more than it be not that there be nothing certain but uncertainty parmenides that of that which seem there be no one thing in general that there be but one thing zeno that one same be not and that there be nothing if there be one thing it would either be in another or in itself if it be in another they be two if it be in itself they be yet two the comprehending and the comprehended accord to these doctrine the nature of thing be no other than a shadow either false or vain this way of speaking in a christian man have ever seem to me very indiscreet and irreverent god can not die god can not contradict himself god can not do this or that i do not like to have the divine power so limited by the law of men mouth and the idea which present itself to u in those proposition ought to be more religiously and reverently express our speaking have it failing and defect as well a all the rest most of the occasion of disturbance in the world be grammatical one our suit only spring from dispute a to the interpretation of law and most war proceed from the inability of minister clearly to express the convention and treaty of amity of prince how many quarrel and of how great importance have the doubt of the meaning of this syllable hoc create in the world let u take the clear conclusion that logic itself present u withal if you say it be fine weather and that you say true it be then fine weather be not this a very certain form of speaking and yet it will deceive u that it will do so let u follow the example if you say i lie if you say true you do lie the art the reason and force of the conclusion of this be the same with the other and yet we be gravel the pyrrhonian philosopher i see can not express their general conception in any kind of speak for they would require a new language on purpose ours be all form of affirmative proposition which be totally antarctic to them insomuch that when they say i doubt they be presently take by the throat to make them confess that at least they know and be assure that they do doubt by which mean they have be compel to shelter themselves under this medical comparison without which their humour would be inexplicable when they pronounce i know not or i doubt they say that this proposition carry off itself with the rest no more nor less than rhubarb that drive out the ill humour and carry itself off with them this fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation what do i know a i bear it with the emblem of a balance see what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking in the present dispute about our religion if you press it adversary too hard they will roundly tell you that it be not in the power of god to make it so that hi body should be in paradise and upon earth and in several place at once and see too what advantage the old scoffer make of this at least say he it be no little consolation to man to see that god can not do all thing for he can not kill himself though he would which be the great privilege we have in our condition he can not make mortal immortal nor revive the dead nor make it so that he who have live have not nor that he who have have honour have not have them have no other right to the past than that of oblivion and that the comparison of man to god may yet be make out by jocose example he can not order it so say he that twice ten shall not be twenty this be what he say and what a christian ought to take heed shall not escape hi lip whereas on the contrary it seem a if men study this foolish daring of language to reduce god to their own measure when we say that the infinity of age a well past a to come be but one instant with god that hi goodness wisdom and power be the same with hi essence our mouth speak it but our understanding apprehend it not and yet such be our vain opinion of ourselves that we must make the divinity to pass through our sieve and thence proceed all the dream and error with which the world abound whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani parvulo aliquo intritata successu ti wonderful to what the wickedness of man heart will proceed if elevate with the least success how magisterially and insolently do epicurus reprove the stoic for maintain that the truly good and happy be appertain only to god and that the wise man have nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it how temerariously have they bind god to destiny a thing which by my consent none that bear the name of a christian shall ever do again and thales plato and pythagoras have enslave him to necessity this arrogance of attempt to discover god with our eye have be the cause that an eminent person among u have attribute to the divinity a corporal form and be the reason of what happen to u every day of attribute to god important event by a particular assignment because they weigh with u they conclude that they also weigh with him and that he have a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to other of less moment to u or of ordinary course magna dii curant parva negligunt the god be concern at great matter but slight the small listen to him he will clear this to you by hi reason nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minimum curant neither indeed do king in their administration take notice of all the least concern a if to that king of king it be more or less to subvert a kingdom or to move the leaf of a tree or a if hi providence act after another manner in incline the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea the hand of hi government be lay upon every thing after the same manner with the same power and order our interest do nothing towards it our inclination and measure sway nothing with him deus ita artifex magnus in magnis ut minor non sit in parvis god be so great an artificer in great thing that he be no less in the least our arrogancy set this blasphemous comparison ever before u because our employment be a burden to u strato have courteously be please to exempt the god from all office a their priest be he make nature produce and support all thing and with her weight and motion make up the several part of the world discharge human nature from the awe of divine judgment quod beatum terumque sit id nec haber negotii quicquam nec exhibere alteri what be bless and eternal have neither any business itself nor give any to another nature will that in like thing there should be a like relation the infinite number of mortal therefore conclude a like number of immortal the infinite thing that kill and destroy presupposes a many that preserve and profit a the soul of the god without tongue eye or ear do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feel and judge our thought so the soul of men when at liberty and loose from the body either by sleep or some ecstacy divine foretell and see thing which whilst join to the body they could not see men say st paul profess themselves to be wise they become fools and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image make like corruptible man do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deification after the great and stately pomp of the funeral so soon a the fire begin to mount to the top of the pyramid and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay they at the same time turn out an eagle which fly upward signify that the soul go into paradise we have a thousand medal and particularly of the worthy faustina where this eagle be represent carry these deify soul to heaven with their heel upwards ti pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and invention like child who be fright with the same face of their playfellow that they themselves have smear and smut quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine cui sua figmenta dominantur a if any thing could be more unhappy than man who be insult over by hi own imagination ti far from honour him who make u to honour him that we have make augustus have more temple than jupiter serve with as much religion and belief of miracle the thracian in return of the benefit they have receive from agesilaus come to bring him word that they have canonize him ha your nation say he to them the power to make god of whom they please pray first deify some one amongst yourselves and when i shall see what advantage he have by it i will thank you for your offer man be certainly stark mad he can not make a worm and yet he will be make god by dozen hear trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency of all the wonderful thing it surmount all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it and take here the argument of the school of philosophy itself if there be a god he be a living creature if he be a living creature he have sense and if he have sense he be subject to corruption if he be without a body he be without a soul and consequently without action and if he have a body it be perishable be not here a triumph we be incapable of have make the world there must then be some more excellent nature that have put a hand to the work it be a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe there must then be something that be well and that must be god when you see a stately and stupendous edifice though you do not know who be the owner of it you would yet conclude it be not build for rat and this divine structure that we behold of the celestial palace have we not reason to believe that it be the residence of some possessor who be much great than we be not the most supreme always the most worthy but we be in the low form nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason the world produce u the world then have soul and reason every part of u be less than we we be part of the world the world therefore be endue with wisdom and reason and that more abundantly than we tis a fine thing to have a great government the government of the world then appertain to some happy nature the star do u no harm they be then full of goodness we have need of nourishment then so have the god also and fee upon the vapour of the earth worldly good be not good to god therefore they be not good to u offend and be offend be equally testimony of imbecility ti therefore folly to fear god god be good by hi nature man by hi industry which be more the divine and human wisdom have no other distinction but that the first be eternal but duration be no accession to wisdom therefore we be companion we have life reason and liberty we esteem goodness charity and justice these quality be then in him in conclusion building and destroy the condition of the divinity be forge by man accord a they relate to himself what a pattern and what a model let u stretch let u raise and swell human quality as much a we please puff up thyself poor man yet more and more and more profecto non deum quern cogitare non possunt sed semetip pro illo cogitantes non ilium sed seipsos non illi sed sibi comparant certainly they do not imagine god whom they can not imagine but they imagine themselves in hi stead they do not compare him but themselves not to him but to themselves in natural thing the effect do but half relate to their cause whats this to the purpose hi condition be above the order of nature too elevate too remote and too mighty to permit itself to be bind and fetter by our conclusion ti not through ourselves that we arrive at that place our way lie too low we be no near heaven on the top of mount cenis than at the bottom of the sea take the distance with your astrolabe they debase god even to the carnal knowledge of woman to so many time and so many generation paulina the wife of satuminus a matron of great reputation at rome think she lay with the god serapis find herself in the arm of an amoroso of hers through the pander of the priest of hi temple varro the most subtle and most learn of all the latin author in hi book of theology writes that the sexton of hercules temple throw dice with one hand for himself and with the other for hercules play after that manner with him for a supper and a wench if he win at the expense of the offering if he lose at hi own the sexton lose and pay the supper and the wench her name be laurentina who saw by night this god in her arm who moreover tell her that the first she meet the next day should give her a heavenly reward which prove to be taruncius a rich young man who take her home to hi house and in time leave her hi inheritrix she in her turn thinking to do a thing that would be please to the god leave the people of rome heir to her and therefore have divine honour attribute to her a if it have not be sufficient that plato be originally descend from the god by a double line and that he have neptune for the common father of hi race it be certainly believe at athens that aristo have a mind to enjoy the fair perictione could not and be warn by the god apollo in a dream to leave her unpolluted and untouched till she should first be bring to bed these be the father and mother of plato how many ridiculous story be there of like cuckoldings commit by the god against poor mortal men and how many husband injuriously scandal in favour of the child in the mahometan religion there be merlin enough find by the belief of the people that be to say child without father spiritual divinely conceive in the womb of virgin and carry name that signify so much in their language we be to observe that to every thing nothing be more dear and estimable than it be the lion the eagle the dolphin prize nothing above their own kind and that every thing assimilate the quality of all other thing to it own proper quality which we may indeed extend or contract but thats all for beyond that relation and principle our imagination can not go can guess at nothing els nor possibly go out thence nor stretch beyond it whence spring these ancient conclusion of all form the most beautiful be that of man therefore god must be of that form no one can be happy without virtue nor virtue be without reason and reason can not inhabit anywhere but in a human shape god be therefore clothe in a human figure ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris ut homini quum de deo cogitet forma occurrat humana it be so imprint in our mind and the fancy be so prepossessed with it that when a man think of god a human figure ever present itself to the imagination therefore it be that xenophanes pleasantly say that if beast frame any god to themselves a ti likely they do they make them certainly such a themselves be and glorify themselves in it a we do for why may not a goose say thus all the part of the universe i have an interest in the earth serve me to walk upon the sun to light me the star have their influence upon me i have such an advantage by the wind and such by the water there be nothing that yon heavenly roof look upon so favourably a me i be the darling of nature be it not man that keep lodge and serf me ti for me that he both sow and grind if he eat me he do the same by hi fellowmen and so do i the worm that kill and devour him a much might be say by a crane and with great confidence upon the account of the liberty of hi flight and the possession of that high and beautiful region tam blanda conciliatrix et tam sui est lena ipsa natura so

point to which the universality of thing aim look into the record that philosophy have keep for two thousand year and more of the affair of heaven the god all that while have neither act nor speak but for man she do not allow them any other consultation or occupation see them here against u in war and here you shall see them participate of our trouble to make a return for our have so often share in theirs the caunians jealous of the authority of their own proper god arm themselves on the day of their devotion and through the whole of their precinct run cut and slash the air with their sword by

conflagration of the world all the god be to die but jupiter man make a thousand pretty society betwixt god and him be he not hi countryman and this be the excuse that upon consideration of this subject scvola a high priest and varro a great theologian in their time make u that it be necessary that the people should be ignorant of many thing that be true and believe many thing that be false quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur see he inquire into the truth by which he would be make free ti fit he should be deceive human eye can not perceive thing but

matter that she make use of if a man inquire of zeno what nature be a fire say he an artisan proper for generation and regularly proceed archimedes master of that science which attribute to itself the precedency before all other for truth and certainty the sun say he be a god of redhot iron wa not this a fine imagination extract from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstration yet not so inevitable and useful but that socrates think it be enough to know so much of geometry only a to measure the land a man buy or sell and that polynus who have be a great and famous doctor in it despise it a full of falsity and manifest vanity after he have once taste the delicate fruit of the lozelly garden of epicurus socrates in xenophon concern this affair say of anaxagoras repute by antiquity learn above all other in celestial and divine matter that he have crack hi brain a all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledge which nothing belong to them when he make the sun to be a burn stone he do not consider that a stone do not shine in the fire and which be bad that it will there consume and in make the sun and fire one that fire do not turn the complexion black in shin upon them that we be able to look fixedly upon fire and that fire kill herbs and plant ti socrates opinion and mine too that the best judging of heaven be not to judge of it at all plato have occasion in hi timous to speak of the demon this undertaking say he exceed my ability we be therefore to believe those ancient who say they be beget by them tis against all reason to refuse a man faith to the child of the god though what they say should not be prove by any necessary or probable reason see they engage to speak of domestic and familiar thing let u see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural thing be it not a ridiculous attempt for u to forge for those to whom by our own confession our knowledge be not able to attain another body and to lend a false form of our own invention a be manifest in this motion of the planet to which see our wit can not possibly arrive nor conceive their natural conduct we lend them material heavy and substantial spring of our own by which to move you would say that we have have coachmakers carpenter and painter that go up on high to make engine of various motion and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly body of differ colour about the axis of necessity accord to plato these be all dream and fanatic folly why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to u and plainly discover to u the mean and conduct of her movement and prepare our eye to see them good god what abuse what mistake should we discover in our poor science i be mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours hold any one thing a it really be and i shall depart hence more ignorant of all other thing than my own ignorance have i not read in plato this divine say that nature be nothing but enigmatic poesy a if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture break out here and there with an infinite variety of false light to puzzle our conjecture latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit qu penetrare in coelum terram intrare possit all those thing lie conceal and involve in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp a to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth and certainly philosophy be no other than sophisticated poetry whence do the ancient writer extract their authority but from the poet and the first of them be poet themselves and writ accordingly plato be but a poet unripped timon call him insultingly a monstrous forger of miracle all superhuman science make use of the poetic style just a woman make use of teeth of ivory where the natural be want and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter a they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump and in the sight of every one do paint patch and trick up themselves with a false and borrow beauty so do science and even our law itself have they say legitimate fiction whereon it build the truth of it justice she give u in presupposition and for current pay thing which she herself inform u be invent for these epicycle eccentric and concentrics which astrology make use of to carry on the motion of the star she give u for the best she could invent upon that subject a also in all the rest philosophy present u not that which really be or what she really believe but what she have contrive with the great and most plausible likelihood of truth and the quaint invention plato upon the discourse of the state of human body and those of beast say i should know that what i have say be truth have i the confirmation of an oracle but this i will affirm that what i have say be the most likely to be true of any thing i could say ti not to heaven only that art send her ropes engine and wheel let u consider a little what she say of u ourselves and of our contexture there be not more retrogradation trepidation accession recession and astonishment in the star and celestial body than they have find out in this poor little human body in earnest they have good reason upon that very account to call it the little world so many tool and part have they employ to erect and build it to assist the motion they see in man and the various function that we find in ourselves in how many part have they divide the soul in how many place lodge it in how many order have they divide and to how many story have they raise this poor creature man besides those that be natural and to be perceive and how many office and vocation have they assign him they make it an imaginary public thing ti a subject that they hold and handle and they have full power grant to them to rip place displace piece and stuff it every one accord to hi own fancy and yet they possess it not they can not not in reality only but even in dream so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture as enormous a it be and botch with a thousand false and fantastic patch and it be not reason to excuse them for though we be satisfied with painter when they paint heaven earth sea mountain and remote island that they give u some slight mark of them and a of thing unknown be content with a faint and obscure description yet when they come and draw u after life or any other creature which be know and familiar to u we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineament and colour and despise them if they fail in it i be very well pleased with the milesian girl who observe the philosopher thales to be always contemplate the celestial arch and to have hi eye ever gaze upward lay something in hi way that he might stumble over to put him in mind that it would be time to take up hi thought about thing that be in the cloud when he have provide for those that be under hi foot doubtless she advise him well rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven for a democritus say by the mouth of cicero but our condition will have it so that the knowledge of what we have in hand be a remote from u and as much above the cloud a that of the star a socrates say in plato that whoever meddle with philosophy may be reproach a thales be by the woman that he see nothing of that which be before him for every philosopher be ignorant of what hi neighbour do aye and of what he do himself and be ignorant of what they both be whether beast or men those people who find sebonds argument too weak that be ignorant of nothing that govern the world that know all have they not sometimes in their writing sound the difficulty they have meet with of know their own be we see very well that the finger move that the foot move that some part assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent and that other work by our direction that one sort of apprehension occasion blush another paleness such an imagination work upon the spleen only another upon the brain one occasion laughter another tear another stupefies and astonishes all our sens and arrest the motion of all our member at one object the stomach will rise at another a member that lie something lower but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable spring and movement never yet man know omnia incerta ration et in natur majestate abdita all uncertain in reason and conceal in the majesty of nature say pliny and st augustin modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus omnino mini est nec comprehendi ab homine potest et hoc ips homo est the manner whereby soul adhere to body be altogether wonderful and can not be conceive by man and yet this be man and yet it be not so much a doubt for the opinion of men be receive accord to the ancient belief by authority and upon trust a if it be religion and law ti receive a gibberish which be commonly speak this truth with all it clutter of argument and proof be admit a a firm and solid body that be no more to be shake no more to be judge of on the contrary every one accord to the best of hi talent corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of hi reason which be a supple utensil pliable and to be accommodate to any figure and thus the world come to be fill with lie and fopperies the reason that men doubt of diver thing be that they never examine common impression they do not dig to the root where the fault and defect lie they only debate upon the branch they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true but if it have be so and so understood it be not inquire into whether galen have say any thing to purpose but whether he have say so or so in truth it be very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgment and that tyranny over our opinion should be extend to the school and arts the god of scholastic knowledge be aristotle ti irreligion to question any of hi decree a it be those of lucurgus at sparta hi doctrine be a magisterial law which peradventure be as false a another i do not know why i should not a willingly embrace either the idea of plato or the atom of epicurus or the plenum or vacuum of leucippus and democritus or the water of thales or the infinity of nature of anaximander or the air of diogenes or the number and symmetry of pythagoras or the infinity of parmenides or the one of musus or the water and fire of apollodorus or the similar part of anaxagoras or the discord and friendship of empedocles or the fire of heraclitus or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinion and determination which this fine human reason produce by it certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddle withal a i should the opinion of aristotle upon this subject of the principle of natural thing which principles he build of three piecesmatter form and privation and what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of thing privation be a negative of what humour could he then make the cause and original of thing that be and yet that be not to be controvert but for the exercise of logic there be nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt but to defend the author of the school from foreign objection hi authority be the nonultra beyond which it be not permit to inquire it be very easy upon approved foundation to build whatever we please for accord to the law and ordering of this begin the other part of the structure be easily carry on without any failure by this way we find our reason wellgrounded and discourse at a venture for our master prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief a be necessary towards conclude afterwards what they please a geometrician do by their grant demand the consent and approbation we allow them give them wherewith to draw u to the right and leave and to whirl u about at their pleasure whatever spring from these presupposition be our master and our god he will take the level of hi foundation so ample and so easy that by them he may mount u up to the cloud if he so please in this practice and negotiation of science we have take the say of pythagoras that every expert person ought to be believe in hi own art for current pay the logician refer the signification of word to the grammarian the rhetorician borrow the state of argument from the logician the poet hi measure from the musician the geometrician hi proportion from the arithmetician and the metaphysicians take physical conjecture for their foundation for every science have it principle presuppose by which human judgment be everywhere keep in check if you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lie they have presently this sentence in their mouth that there be no dispute with person who deny principle now men can have no principle if not reveal to them by the divinity of all the rest the begin the middle and the end be nothing but dream and vapour to those that contend upon presupposition we must on the contrary presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute be for every human presupposition and declaration have as much authority one a another if reason do not make the difference wherefore they be all to be put into the balance and first the general and those that tyrannize over u the persuasion of certainty be a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty and there be not a more foolish sort of men nor that be less philosopher than the philodoxes of plato we must inquire whether fire be hot whether snow be white if there be any such thing a hard or soft within our knowledge and a to those answer of which they make old story a he that doubt if there be any such thing a heat whom they bid throw himself into the fire and he that deny the coldness of ice whom they bid to put ice into hi bosomthey be pitiful thing unworthy of the profession of philosophy if they have let u alone in our natural be to receive the appearance of thing without u accord a they present themselves to u by our sens and have permit u to follow our own natural appetite govern by the condition of our birth they might then have reason to talk at that rate but ti from them we have learn to make ourselves judge of the world ti from them that we derive this fancy that human reason be controllergeneral of all that be without and within the roof of heaven that comprehend every thing that can do every thing by the mean of which every thing be know and understood this answer would be good among the cannibal who enjoy the happiness of a long quiet and peaceable life without aristotle precept and without the knowledge of the name of physic this answer would perhaps be of more value and great force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention of this all animal and all where the power of the law of nature be yet pure and simple would be as capable a we but a for them they have renounce it they need not tell u it be true for you see and feel it to be so they must tell me whether i really feel what i think i do and if i do feel it they must then tell me why i feel it and how and what let them tell me the name original the part and juncture of heat and cold the quality of the agent and patient or let them give up their profession which be not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason that be their test in all sort of essay but certainly tis a test full of falsity error weakness and defect which way can we good prove it than by itself if we be not to believe her when speaking of herself she can hardly be think fit to judge of foreign thing if she know any thing it must at least be her own be and abide she be in the soul and either a part or an effect of it for true and essential reason from which we by a false colour borrow the name be lodge in the bosom of the almighty there be her habitation and recess ti thence that she impart her ray when god be please to impart any beam of it to mankind a balias issue from her father head to communicate herself to the world now let u see what human reason tell u of herself and of the soul not of the soul in general of which almost all philosophy make the celestial and first body participant nor of that which thales attribute to thing which themselves be reputed inanimate lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone but of that which appertain to u and that we ought the best to know crate and dicarchus be of opinion that there be no soul at all but that the body thus stir by a natural motion plato that it be a substance moving of itself thales a nature without repose aedepiades an exercising of the sens hesiod and anaximander a thing compose of earth and water parmenides of earth and fire empedocles of blood posidonius cleanthes and galen that it be heat or a hot complexion hippocrates a spirit diffuse all over the body varro that it be an air receive at the mouth heat in the lung moisten in the heart and diffuse throughout the whole body zeno the quintessence of the four element heraclides ponticus that it be the light zenocrates and the egyptian a mobile number the chaldean a virtue without any determinate form let u not forget aristotle who hold the soul to be that which naturally cause the body to move which he call entelechia with a cold an invention a any of the rest for he neither speaks of the essence nor of the original nor of the nature of the soul but only take notice of the effect lactantius seneca and most of the dogmatist have confess that it be a thing they do not understand after all this enumeration of opinion harum sententiarum quo vera sit deus aliquis viderit of these opinion which be the true let some god determine say cicero i know by myself say st bernard how incomprehensible god be see i can not comprehend the part of my own be heraclitus who be of opinion that every be be full of soul and demon do nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul a ever to arrive at it so profound be the essence of it neither be there less controversy and debate about seating of it hippocrates and hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain democritus and aristotle throughout the whole body epicurus in the stomach the stoic about and within the heart erasistratus adjoin the membrane of the epicranium empedocles in the blood a also moses which be the reason why he interdict eat the blood of beast because the soul be there seat galen think that every part of the body have it soul strato have place it betwixt the eyebrow qu facie quidem sit animus aut ubi habitet ne quorendum quidem est what figure the soul be of or what part it inhabit be not to be inquire into say cicero i very willingly deliver this author to you in hi own word for should i alter eloquence itself besides it be but a poor prize to steal the matter of hi invention they be neither very frequent nor of any great weight and sufficiently know but the reason why chrysippus argue it to be about the heart a all the rest of that sect do be not to be omit it be say he because when we would affirm any thing we lay our hand upon our breast and when we would pronounce y which signifies i we let the low jaw fall towards the stomach this place ought not to be pass over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man for besides that these consideration be infinitely light in themselves the last be only a proof to the greek that they have their soul lodge in that part no human judgment be so sprightly and vigilant that it do not sometimes sleep why do we fear to say the stoic the father of human prudence think that the soul of a man crush under a ruin long labour and strives to get out like a mouse caught in a trap before it can disengage itself from the burden some hold that the world be make to give body by way of punishment to the spirit fall by their own fault from the purity wherein they have be create the first creation have be incorporeal and that accord a they be more or less deprave from their spirituality so be they more or less jocundly or dully incorporate and that thence proceed all the variety of so much create matter but the spirit that for hi punishment be invest with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change the extremity of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness a plutarch say of the testimony of history that accord to chart and map the utmost bound of know r country be take up with marsh impenetrable forest desert and uninhabitable place this be the reason why the most gross and childish raving be most find in those author who treat of the most elevated subject and proceed the furthest in them lose themselves in their own curiosity and presumption the beginning and end of knowledge be equally foolish observe to what a pitch plato fly in hi poetic cloud do but take notice there of the gibberish of the god but what do he dream of when he define a man to be a twolegged animal without feather give those who have a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion for have pull a capon alive they go about call it the man of plato and what do the epicurean think of out of what simplicity do they first imagine that their atom that they say be body have some weight and a natural motion downwards have make the world till they be put in mind by their adversary that accord to this description it be impossible they should unite and join to one another their fall be so direct and perpendicular and make so many parallel line throughout wherefore there be a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion and that they should moreover accoutre their atom with hooked tail by which they might unite and cling to one another and even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it if the atom have by chance form so many sort of figure why do it never fall out that they make a house or a shoe why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of greek letter strew all over a certain place might fall into the contexture of the iliadwhatever be capable of reason say zeno be good than that which be not capable there be nothing well than the world the world be therefore capable of reason cotta by this way of argumentation make the world a mathematician and ti also make a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of zeno the whole be more than a part we be capable of wisdom and be part of the world therefore the world be wise there be infinite like example not only of argument that be false in themselves but silly one that do not hold in themselves and that accuse their author not so much of ignorance a imprudence in the reproach the philosopher dash one another in the teeth withal upon their dissension in their sect and opinion whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the foolery of human wisdom would produce wonder i willingly muster up these few for a pattern by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instruction let u judge by these what opinion we be to have of man of hi sense and reason when in these great person that have raise human knowledge so high so many gross mistake and manifest error be to be find for my part i be apt to believe that they have treat of knowledge casually and like a toy with both hand and have contend about reason a of a vain and frivolous instrument set on foot all sort of fancy and invention sometimes more sinewy and sometimes weak this same plato who define man a if he be a cock say elsewhere after socrates that he do not in truth know what man be and that he be a member of the world the hard to understand by this variety and instability of opinion they tacitly lead u a it be by the hand to this resolution of their irresolution they profess not always to deliver their opinion barefaced and apparent to u they have one while disguise them in the fabulous shadow of poetry and at another in some other vizor for our imperfection carry this also along with it that crude meat be not always proper for our stomach we must dry alter and mix it they do the same they sometimes conceal their real opinion and judgment and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use they will not make an open profession of ignorance and of the imbecility of human reason that they may not fright child but they sufficiently discover it to u under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science i advise a person in italy who have a great mind to speak italian that provide he only have a desire to make himself understood without be ambitious in any other respect to excel that he should only make use of the first word that come to the tongue end whether latin french spanish or gascon and that by add the italian termination he could not fail of hit upon some idiom of the country either tuscan roman venetian piedmontese or neapolitan and so fall in with some one of those many form i say the same of philosophy she have so many face so much variety and have say so many thing that all our dream and raving be there to be find human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that be not there nihil tam absurd do potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum nothing can be say so absurd that have not be say before by some of the philosopher and i be the more willing to expose my whimsy to the public forasmuch a though they be spin out of myself and without any pattern i know they will be find relate to some ancient humour and some will not stick to say see whence he take it my manner be natural i have not call in the assistance of any discipline to erect them but weak a they be when it come into my head to lay them open to the world view and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb i go to adorn them with reason and example it be a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourse and example i never know what regimen my life be of till it be near wear out and spend a new figurean unpremeditated and accidental philosopher but to return to the soul inasmuch a plato have place reason in the brain anger in the heart and concupiscence in the liver ti likely that it be rather an interpretation of the movement of the soul than that he intend a division and separation of it a of a body into several member and the most likely of their opinion be that ti always a soul that by it faculty reason remembers comprehends judge desire and exercise all it other operation by diver instrument of the body a the pilot guide hi ship accord to hi experience one while strain or slack the cordage one while hoist the mainyard or remove the rudder by one and the same power carry on several effect and that it be lodge in the brain which appear in that the wound and accident that touch that part do immediately offend the faculty of the soul and ti not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other part of the body a the sun shed from heaven it light and influence and fill the world with them some have say that there be a general soul a it be a great body whence all the particular soul be extract and thither again return always restore themselves to that universal matter other that they only rejoin and reunite themselves to it other that they be produce from the divine substance other by the angel of fire and air other that they be from all antiquity and some that they be create at the very point of time the body want them other make them to descend from the orb of the moon and return thither the generality of the ancient believe that they be beget from father to son after a like manner and produce with all other natural thing take their argument from the likeness of child to their father and that we see descend from father to their child not only bodily mark but moreover a resemblance of humour complexion and inclination of the soul that thereupon the divine justice be ground punish in the child the fault of their father forasmuch a the contagion of paternal vice be in some sort imprint in the soul of child and that the ill government of their will extend to them moreover that if soul have any other derivation than a natural consequence and that they have be some other thins out of the body they would retain some memory of their first be the natural faculty that be proper to them of discourse reasoning and remember be consider for to make the condition of our soul such a we would have it to be we must suppose them allknowing even in their natural simplicity and purity by these mean they have be such be free from the prison of the body as well before they enter into it a we hope they shall be after they be go out of it and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember be get in the body a plato say that what we learn be no other than a remembrance of what we know before a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false forasmuch in the first place a that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have be teach and that if the memory do purely perform it office it would at least suggest to u something more than what we have learn secondly that which she know be in her purity be a true knowledge know thing a they be by her divine intelligence whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her wherein she can not employ her reminiscence that image and conception have never be plant in her to say that the corporal prison do in such sort suffocate her natural faculty that they be there utterly extinct be first contrary to this other belief of acknowledge her power to be so great and the operation of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable a to have thereby conclude that divinity and eternity past and the immortality to come furthermore ti here with u and not elsewhere that the force and effect of the soul ought to be consider all the rest of her perfection be vain and useless to her ti by her present condition that all her immortality be to be reward and pay and of the life of man only that she be to render an account it have be injustice to have strip her of her mean and power to have disarm her in order in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she be force and compel to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time peradventure but an hour or two or at the most but a century which have no more proportion with infinity than an instant in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole be it be an unreasonable disproportion too to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life plato to defend himself from this inconvenience will have future payment limit to the term of a hundred year relatively to human duration and of u ourselves there be enough who have give them temporal limit by this they judge that the generation of the soul follow the common condition of human thing a also her life accord to the opinion of epicurus and democritus which have be the most receive in consequence of these fine appearance that they saw it bom and that accord a the body grow more capable they saw it increase in vigour a the other do that it feebleness in infancy be very manifest and in time it good strength and maturity and after that it declension and old age and at last it decrepitude they perceive it to be capable of diver passion and agitate with diver painful motion whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness capable of alteration and change of cheerfulness of stupidity and languor and subject to disease and injury a the stomach or the foot dazzle and intoxicate with the fume of wine jostle from her seat by the vapour of a burning fever lay asleep by the application of some medicament and rouse by other they saw it astonish and overthrow in all it faculty through the mere bite of a mad dog and in that condition to have no stability of reason no sufficiency no virtue no philosophical resolution no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accident the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of socrates to shake all hi wisdom and all hi great and regulated imagination and so to annihilate them ad that there remain no trace of hi former knowledge and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four year old a poison sufficient to make all philosophy if it be incarnate become furious and mad insomuch that cato who ever disdain death and fortune could not endure the sight of a lookingglass or of water overwhelm with horror and affright at the thought of fall by the contagion of a mad dog into the disease call by physician hydrophobia now a to this particular philosophy have sufficiently arm man to encounter all other accident either with patience or if the search of that cost too dear by an infallible defeat in totally deprive himself of all sentiment but these be expedient that be only of use to a soul be itself and in it full power capable of reason and deliberation but not at all proper for this inconvenience where in a philosopher the soul become the soul of a madman trouble overturn and lose which many occasion may produce a a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself or a wound in a certain part of the person or vapour from the stomach any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain the philosopher methinks have not much touch this string no more than another of equal importance they have this dilemma continually in their mouth to console our mortal condition the soul be either mortal or immortal if mortal it will suffer no pain if immortal it will change for the good they never touch the other branch what if she change for the bad and leave to the poet the menace of future torment but thereby they make themselves a good game these be two omission that i often meet with in their discourse i return to the first this soul lose the use of the sovereign stoical good so constant and so firm our fine human wisdom must here yield and give up her arm a to the rest they also consider by the vanity of human reason that the mixture and association of two so contrary thing a the mortal and the immortal be unimaginable moreover they perceive the soul tend towards death as well a the body which accord to zeno the image of sleep do sufficiently demonstrate to u for he look upon it a a fainting and fall of the soul as well a of the body contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere and what they perceive in some that the soul maintain it force and vigour to the last gasp of life they attribute to the variety of disease a it be observable in men at the last extremity that some retain one sense and some another one the hearing and another the smell without any manner of defect or alteration and that there be not so universal a deprivation that some part do not remain vigorous and entire the sight of our judgment be to truth the same that the owls eye be to the splendour of the sun say aristotle by what can we good convince him than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light for the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul which cicero say be first introduce accord to the testimony of book at least by pherecydes syrius in the time of king tullus though some attribute it to thales and other to other ti the part of human science that be treat of with the great doubt and reservation the most positive dogmatist be fain in this point principally to fly to the refuge of the academy no one doubt what aristotle have establish upon this subject no more than all the ancient in general who handle it with a waver belief rem gratissimam promittentium magi quam probantium a thing more acceptable in the promisor than the provers he conceal himself in cloud of word of difficult unintelligible sense and have leave to those of hi sect a great a dispute about hi judgment a about the matter itself two thing render this opinion plausible to them one that without the immortality of soul there would be nothing whereon to grind the vain hope of glory which be a consideration of wonderful repute in the world the other that it be a very profitable impression a plato say that vice when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice be still within the reach of the divine which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty man be excessively solicitous to prolong hi be and have to the utmost of hi power provide for it there be monument for the conservation of the body and glory to preserve the name he have employ all hi wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself impatient of hi fortune and to prop himself by hi invention the soul by reason of it anxiety and impotence be unable to stand by itself wander up and down to seek out consolation hope and foundation and alien circumstance to which she adhere and fix and how light or fantastic soever invention deliver them to her relies more willingly and with great assurance upon them than upon herself but tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainer of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short and how weak their argument be when they go about to prove it by human reason somnia sunt non docentis sed optantis they be dreams not of the teacher but wisher say one of the ancient by which testimony man may know that he owe the truth he himself find out to fortune and accident since that even then when it be fall into hi hand he have not wherewith to hold and maintain it and that hi reason have not force to make use of it all thing produce by our own meditation and understand whether true or false be subject to incertitude and controversy twas for the chastisement of our pride and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity that god work the perplexity and confusion of the tower of babel whatever we undertake without hi assistance whatever we see without the lamp of hi grace be but vanity and folly we corrupt the very essence of truth which be uniform and constant by our weakness when fortune put it into our possession what course soever man take of himself god still permit it to come to the same confusion the image whereof he so lively represent to u in the just chastisement wherewith he crush nimrod presumption and frustrate the vain attempt of hi proud structure perdam sapientiam sapientium et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent the diversityof idiom and tongue with which he disturb this work what be they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinion and reason which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom and to very good effect too for what would hold u if we have but the least grain of knowledge this saint have very much oblige me ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humilitatis exercitatio est aut elationis attritio the very concealment of the truth be either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption to what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly but to return to my subject it be truly very good reason that we should be behold to god only and to the favour of hi grace for the truth of so noble a belief since from hi sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality which consist in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude let u ingenuously confess that god alone have dictate it to u and faith for ti no lesson of nature and our own reason and whoever will inquire into hi own be and power both within and without without this divine privilege whoever shall consider man impartially and without flattery will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relish of any thing but death and earth the more we give and confess to owe and render to god we do it with the great christianity that which this stoic philosopher say he hold from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice have it not be well that he have hold it from god cum de animarum otemitate disserimus non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos aut colentium utor hc public persuasion when we discourse of the immortality of soul the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal power be of no small advantage i make use of this public persuasion now the weakness of human argument upon this subject be particularly manifest by the fabulous circumstance they have superadded a consequence of this opinion to find out of what condition this immortality of ours be let u omit the stoic usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus diu mansuros aiunt animos semper negant they give u a long life a also they do to crow they say our soul shall continue long but that it shall continue always they deny who give to souls a life after this but finite the most universal and received fancy and that continue down to our time in various place be that of which they make pythagoras the author not that he be the original inventor but because it receive a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of hi approbation that souls at their departure out of u do nothing but shift from one body to another from a lion to a horse from a horse to a king continually travel at this rate from habitation to habitation and he himself say that he remember he have be thalides since that euphorbus afterwards hermotimus and finally from pyrrhus be pass into pythagoras have a memory of himself of two hundred and six year and some have add that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven and come down again origen make them eternally to go and come from a good to a bad estate the opinion that varro mention be that after four hundred and forty year revolution they should be reunite to their first body chrysippus hold that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited plato who profess to have embrace this belief from pindar and the ancient poet that we be to undergo infinite vicissitude of mutation for which the soul be prepared have neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what be temporal a it life here be but temporal concludes that it have a singular knowledge of the affair of heaven of hell of the world through all which it have pass repassed and make stay in several voyage be matter for her memory observe her progress elsewhere the soul that have live well be reunite to the star to which it be assign that which have live ill remove into a woman and if it do not there reform be again remove into a beast of condition suitable to it vicious manner and shall see no end of it punishment till it be return to it natural constitution and that it have by the force of reason purge itself from those gross stupid and elementary quality it be pollute with but i will not omit the objection the epicurean make against this transmigration from one body to another ti a pleasant one they ask what expedient would be find out if the number of the dying should chance to be great than that of those who be come into the world for the soul turn out of their old habitation would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging and they far demand how they shall pass away their time whilst wait till new quarter be make ready for them or on the contrary if more animal should be bear than die the body they say would be but in an ill condition whilst wait for a soul to be infuse into it and it would fall out that some body would die before they have be alive other have arrest the soul in the body of the decease with it to animate serpent worm and other beast which be say to be breed out of the corruption of our member and even out of our ash other divide them into two part the one mortal the other immortal other make it corporeal and nevertheless immortal some make it immortal without sense or knowledge there be other even among ourselves who have believe that devil be make of the soul of the damn a plutarch think that god be make of those that be save for there be few thing which that author be so positive in a he be in this maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression we be told say he and steadfastly should believe that the soul of virtuous men both accord to nature and the divine justice become saint and from saint demigod and from demigod after they be perfectly a in sacrifice of purgation cleanse and purify be deliver from all passibility and all mortality they become not by any civil decree but in real truth and accord to all probability of reason entire and perfect god in receive a most happy and glorious end but who desire to see himhim who be yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosopher lay about him with great boldness and relate hi miracle upon this subject i refer him to hi treatise of the moon and of the demon of socrates where he may as evidently a in any other place whatever satisfy himself that the mystery of philosophy have many strange thing in common with those of poetry human understanding lose itself in attempt to sound and search all thing to the bottom even a we tire and wear out with a long course of life return to infancy and dotage see here the fine and certain instruction which we extract from human knowledge

and oblige to certain opinion that they be bind to defend even those they do not approve and that we receive the art by civil authority and decree so that the school have but one pattern and a like circumscribed institution and discipline we no more take notice what the coin weighs and be really worth but every one receive it accord to the estimate that common approbation and use put upon it the alloy be not question but how much it be current for in like manner all thing pass we take physic a we do geometry and trick of hocuspocus enchantment and lovespells the correspondence of the soul of the dead prognostication domifications and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosopher stone all thing pass for current pay without any manner of scruple or contradiction we need to know no more but that mar house be in the middle of the triangle of the hand that of venus in the thumb and that of mercury in the little finger that when the tableline cut the tubercle of the forefinger tis a sign of cruelty that when it fall short of the middle finger and that the natural medianline make an angle with the vital in the same side ti a sign of a miserable death that if in a woman the natural line be open and do not close the angle with the vital this denote that she shall not be very chaste i leave you to judge whether a man qualify with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all company theophrastus say that human knowledge guide by the sens might judge of the cause of thing to a certain degree but that be arrive to first and extreme cause it must stop short and retire by reason either of it own infirmity or the difficulty of thing ti a moderate and gentle opinion that our own understanding may conduct u to the knowledge of some thing and that it have certain measure of power beyond which ti temerity to employ it this opinion be plausible and introduce by men of well composed mind but tis hard to limit our wit which be curious and greedy and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty pace have experimentally find that wherein one have fail the other have hit and that what be unknown to one age the age following have explain and that art and science be not cast in a mould but be form and perfect by degree by often handle and polish a bear leisurely lick their cub into form what my force can not discover i do not yet desist to sound and to try and

disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principle if this aim do not stop hi career he run into an infinite irresolution non potest aliud alio magi minusve comprehendi quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi one thing can no more or less be comprehend than another because the definition of comprehend all thing be the same now tis very likely that if the soul know any thing it would in the first place know itself and if it know any thing out of itself it would be it own body and case before any thing els if we see the god of physic to this very day debate about our anatomy when be we to expect that they will be agree we be near neighbour to ourselves than whiteness to snow or weight to stone if man do not know himself how should he know hi force and function it be not perhaps that we have not some real knowledge in u but ti by chance forasmuch a error be receive into our soul by the same way after the same manner and by the same conduct it have not wherewithal to distinguish them nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood the academic admit a certain partiality of judgment and think it too crude to say that it be not more likely to say that snow be white than black and that we be no more assured of the motion of a stone throw by the hand than of that of the eighth sphere and to avoid this difficulty and strangeness that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination though they conclude that we be in no sort capable of knowledge and that truth be engulf in so profound an abyss a be not to be penetrate by human sight yet they acknowledge some thing to be more likely than other and receive into their judgment this faculty that they have a power to incline to one appearance more than another they allow him this propension interdict all resolution the pyrrhonian opinion be more bold and also somewhat more likely for this academic inclination and this propension to one proposition rather than another what be it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that if our understanding be capable of the form lineaments port and face of truth it might as well see it entire a by half spring and imperfect this appearance of likelihood which make them rather take the left hand than the right augments it multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turn the scale to a hundred to a thousand ounces it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy and determine one choice one entire truth but why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be sway by verisimilitude if they know not the truth how should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence either we can absolutely judge or absolutely we can not if our intellectual and sensible faculty be without foot or foundation if they only pull and drive ti to no purpose that we suffer our judgment to be carry away with any part of their operation what appearance soever they may seem to present u and the sure and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it keep itself temperate upright and inflexible without totter or without agitation inter visa vera aut falsa ad animi assensum nihil interest amongst thing that seem whether true or false it signify nothing to the assent of the mind that thing do not lodge in u in their form and essence and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority we sufficiently see because if it be so we should receive them after the same manner wine would have the same relish with the sick a with the healthful he who have hi finger chapt or benumb would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handle that another do foreign subject then surrender themselves to our mercy and be seat in u a we please now if on our part we receive any thing without alteration if human grasp be capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own mean these mean be common to all men this truth would be convey from hand to hand from one to another and at least there would be some one thing to be find in the world amongst so many a there be that would be believe by men with an universal consent but this that there be no one proposition that be not debate and controvert amongst u or that may not be make it very manifest that our natural judgment do not very clearly discern what it embrace for my judgment can not make my companion approve of what it approve which be a sign that i seize it by some other mean than by a natural power that be in me and in all other men let u lay aside this infinite confusion of opinion which we see even amongst the philosopher themselves and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of thing for this be truly presupposed that men i mean the most knowing the best bom and of the best part be not agree about any one thing not that heaven be over our head for they that doubt of every thing do also doubt of that and they who deny that we be able to comprehend any thing say that we have not comprehend that the heaven be over our head and these two opinion be without comparison the strong in number besides this infinite diversityand division through the trouble that our judgment give ourselves and the incertainty that every one be sensible of in himself tis easy to perceive that it seat be very unstable and insecure how variously do we judge of thingshow often do we alter our opinion what i hold and believe today i hold and believe with my whole belief all my instrument and engine seize and take hold of this opinion and become responsible to me for it at least as much a in them lie i could not embrace nor conserve any truth with great confidence and assurance than i do this i be wholly and entirely possess with it but have it not befall me not only once but a hundred a thousand time every day to have embrace some other thing with all the same instrument and in the same condition which i have since judge to be false a man must at least become wise at hi own expense if i have often find myself betray under this colour if my touch prof commonly false and my balance unequal and unjust what assurance can i now have more than at other time be it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceive by my guide nevertheless let fortune remove and shift u five hundred time from place to place let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief a into a vessel other and other opinion yet still the present and the last be the certain and infallible one for this we must abandon good honour life health and all whatever be preach to u and whatever we learn we should still remember that it be man that give and man that receive tis a mortal hand that present it to u tis a mortal hand that accept it the thing that come to u from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion the sole mark of truth which also we do not see with our own eye nor receive by our own mean that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if god for this end do not prepare it if god do not by hi particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it at least our frail and defective condition ought to make u behave ourselves with more reserved and moderation in our innovation and change we ought to remember that whatever we receive into the understanding we often receive thing that be false and that it be by the same instrument that so often give themselves the lie and be so often deceive now it be no wonder they should so often contradict themselves be so easy to be turn and sway by very light occurrence it be certain that our apprehension our judgment and the faculty of the soul in general suffer accord to the movement and alteration of the body which alteration be continual are not our mind more sprightly ou memory more prompt and quick and our thought more lively in health than in sickness do not joy and gayety make u receive subject that present themselves to our soul quite otherwise than care and melancholy do you believe that catullus verse or those of sappho please an old doting miser a they do a vigorous amorous young man cleomenes the son of anexandridas be sick hi friend reproach him that he have humour and whimsy that be new and unaccustomed i believe it say he neither be i the same man now a when i be in health be now another person my opinion and fancy be also other than they be before in our court of justice this word be much in use which be speak of criminal when they find the judge in a good humour gentle and mild gaudeat de bon fortun let him rejoice in hi good fortune for it be most certain that mens judgment be sometimes more prone to condemnation more sharp and severe and at other more facile easy and inclined to excuse he that carry with him from hi house the pain of the gout jealousy or theft by hi man have hi whole soul possess with anger it be not to be doubt but that hi judgment will lean this way that venerable senate of the areopagite use to hear and determine by night for fear l the sight of the party might corrupt their justice the very air itself and the serenity of heaven will cause some mutation in u accord to these verse in cicero ti not only fevers debauch and great accident that overthrow our judgmentsthe least thing in the world will do it and we be not to doubt though we may not be sensible of it that if a continue fever can overwhelm the soul a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding we be not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it and consequently there be hardly one single hour in a man whole life wherein our judgment be in it due place and right condition our body be subject to so many continual mutation and stuffed with so many several sort of spring that i believe the physician that it be hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order a to what remain this malady do not very easily discover itself unless it be extreme and past remedy forasmuch a reason go always lame halting and that too as well with falsehood a with truth and therefore tis hard to discover her deviation and mistake i always call that appearance of meditation which every one forge in himself reason this reason of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary one about one and the same subject be an instrument of lead and of wax ductile pliable and accommodate to all sort of bias and to all measure so that nothing remain but the art and skill how to turn and mould it how uprightly soever a judge may mean if he do not look well to himself which few care to do hi inclination to friendship to relationship to beauty or revenge and not only thing of that weight but even the fortuitous instinct that make u favour one thing more than another and that without reason permission put the choice upon u in two equal subject or some shadow of like vanity may insensibly insinuate into hi judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause and make the balance dip i that watch myself as narrowly a i can and that have my eye continually bent upon myself like one that have no great business to do elsewhere dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness i find in myself my foot be so unstable and unsteady i find myself so apt to totter and reel and my sight so disorder that fast i be quite another man than when full if health and a fair day smile upon me i be a very affable goodnatured man if a corn trouble my toe i be sullen out of humour and not to be see the same pace of a horse seem to me one while hard and another easy and the same way one while short and another longer and the same form one while more another less agreeable i be one while for do every thing and another for do nothing at all and what please me now would be a trouble to me at another time i have a thousand senseless and casual action within myself either i be possess by melancholy or sway by choler now by it own private authority sadness predominate in me and by and by i be as merry a a cricket when i take a book in hand i have then discover admirable grace in such and such passage and such a have strike my soul let me light upon them at another time i may turn and toss tumble and rattle the leaf to no purpose ti then to me an inform and undiscovered mass even in my own writing i do not always find the air of my first fancy i know not what i would have say and be often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense because i have lose the first that be good i do nothing but go and come my judgment do not always advanceit float and roam very often a i be apt to do have for exercise take to maintain an opinion contrary to my own my mind bending and apply itself that way do so engage me that way that i no more discern the reason of my former belief and forsake it i be a it be mislead by the side to which i incline be it what it will and carry away by my own weight every one almost would say the same of himself if he consider himself a i do preacher very well know that the emotion which steal upon them in speak animate them towards belief and that in passion we be more warm in the defence of our proposition take ourselves a deep impression of it and embrace it with great vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state you only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause he return you a dubious and uncertain answer by which you find him indifferent which side he take have you fee him well that he may relish it the good do he begin to be really concerned and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel hi reason and learning will by degree grow hot in your cause behold an apparent and undoubted truth present itself to hi understanding he discover a new light in your business and do in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it be so nay i do not know whether the ardour that spring from spite and obstinacy against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger or the interest of reputation may not have make some men even at the stake maintain the opinion for which at liberty and amongst friend they would not have burn a finger the shock and jostle that the soul receive from the body passion can do much in it but it own can do a great deal more to which it be so subjected that perhaps it may be make good that it have no other pace and motion but from the breath of those wind without the agitation of which it would be becalm and without action like a ship in the middle of the sea to which the wind hare deny their assistance and whoever should maintain this siding with the peripatetic would do u no great wrong see it be very well know that the great and most noble action of the soul proceed from and stand in need of this impulse of the passion valour they say can not be perfect without the assistance of anger semper ajax fortis fortissimus tamen in furore ajax be always brave but most when in a fury neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry nay the advocate it be say be to inspire the judge with indignation to obtain justice irregular desire move themistocles and demosthenes and have push on the philosopher to watch fasting and pilgrimage and lead u to honour learning and health which be all very useful end and this meanness of soul in suffer anxiety and trouble serf to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience and to make u sensible of the scourge of god and politic correction for the chastisement of our offence compassion be a spur to clemency and the prudence of preserving and govern ourselves be rouse by our fear and how many brave action by ambition how many by presumption in short there be no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation may not this be one of the reason that move the epicurean to discharge god from all care and solicitude of our affair because even the effect of hi goodness could not be exercise in our behalf without disturb it repose by the mean of passion which be so many spur and instrument prick on the soul to virtuous action or have they think otherwise and take them for tempest that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity ut mari tranquillitas intettigitur null ne minimum quidem aura fluctus commovente sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur quum perturbatis nulla est qua moveri queat a it be understood to be a calm sea when there be not the least breath of air stir so the state of the soul be discern to be quiet and appease when there be no perturbation to move it what varieties of sense and reason what contrariety of imagination do the diversityof our passion inspire u with what assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable subject by it condition to the dominion of trouble and never go other than a forced and borrow pace if our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation if it be from folly and rashness that it be to receive the impression of thing what security can we expect from it be it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the great action and near approach the divinity when they be furious mad and beside themselves we better ourselves by the privation of our reason and drilling it the two natural way to enter into the cabinet of the god and there to foresee the course of destiny be fury and sleep this be pleasant to consider by the dislocation that passion cause in our reason we become virtuous by it extirpation occasion by madness or the image of death we become diviner and prophet i be never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing a this tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth have inspire the spirit of philosophy which make it confess contrary to it own proposition that the most calm compose and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in be not it best condition our waking be more a sleep than sleep itself our wisdom less wise than folly our dream be worth more than our meditation and the bad place we can take be in ourselves but do not philosophy think that we be wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters when dismiss from man so clearsighted so great and so perfect and whilst it be in man so terrestrial ignorant and dark be a voice proceed from the spirit of dark terrestrial and ignorant man and for this reason a voice not to be trust and believe i be of a soft and heavy complexion have no great experience of these vehement agitation the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden without give it leisure to recollect itself but the passion that be say to be produce by idleness in the heart of young men though it proceed leisurely and with a measured progress do evidently manifest to those who have try to oppose it power the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion i have formerly attempt to withstand and repel it for i be so far from be one of those that invite vice that i do not so much a follow them if they do not haul me along i perceive it to spring grow and increase in spite of my resistance and at last living and see a i be wholly to seize and possess me so that a if rouse from drunkenness the image of thing begin to appear to me quite other than they use to be i evidently saw the advantage of the object i desire grow and increase and expand by the influence of my imagination and the difficulty of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth and both my reason and conscience to be lay aside but this fire be evaporate in an instant a from a flash of lightning i be aware that my soul resume another kind of sight another state and another judgment the difficulty of retreat appear great and invincible and the same thing have quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire have present them to me which of the two most truly pyrrho know nothing about it we be never without sickness ague have their hot and cold fit from the effect of an ardent passion we fall again to shiver as much a i have advance so much i retire now from the knowledge of this volubility of mine i have accidentally beget in myself a certain constancy of opinion and have not much alter those that be first and natural in me for what appearance soever there may be in novelty i do not easily change for fear of losing by the bargain and a i be not capable of choose i take other men choice and keep myself in the station wherein god have place me i could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual roll thus have i by the grace of god preserve myself entire without anxiety or trouble of conscience in the ancient faith of our religion amidst so many sect and division a our age have produce the writing of the ancient the best author i mean be full and solid tempt and carry me which way almost they will he that i be read seem always to have the most force and i find that every one in hi turn be in the right though they contradict one another the facility that good wit have of render every thing likely they would recommend and that nothing be so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity a mine this evidently show the weakness of their testimony the heaven and the star have be three thousand year in motion all the world be of that belief till cleanthes the samian or accord to theophrastus nicetas of syracuse take it into hi head to maintain that it be the earth that move turn about it axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac and copernicus have in our time so ground this doctrine that it very regularly serve to all astrological consequence what use can we make of this if not that we ought not much to care which be the true opinion and who know but that a third a thousand year hence may over throw the two former so that when any new doctrine present itself to u we have great reason to mistrust and to consider that before that be set on foot the contrary have be generally receive and that a that have be overthrow by this a third invention in time to come may start up which may damn the second before the principle that aristotle introduce be in reputation other principle content human reason a these satisfy u now what patent have these people what particular privilege that the career of our invention must be stop by them and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them they be no more exempt from be thrust out of door than their predecessor be when any one press me with a new argument i ought to believe that what i can not answer another can for to believe all likelihood that a man can not confute be great simplicity it would by that mean come to pass that all the vulgar and we be all of the vulgar would have their belief as tumable a a weathercock for their soul be so easy to be impose upon and without any resistance must of force incessantly receive other and other impression the last still efface all footstep of that which go before he that find himself weak ought to answer accord to practice that he will speak with hi counsel or refer himself to the wiser from whom he receive hi instruction how long be it that physic have be practise in the world ti say that a new comer call paracelsus change and overthrow the whole order of ancient rule and maintain that till now it have be of no other use but to kill men i believe he will easily make this good but i do not think it be wisdom to venture my life in make trial of hi own experience we be not to believe every one say the precept because every one can say all thing a man of this profession of novelty and physical reformation not long since tell me that all the ancient be notoriously mistake in the nature and motion of the wind which he would evidently demonstrate to me if i would give him the hearing after i have with some patience hear hi argument which be all full of likelihood of truth what then say i do those that sail accord to theophrastus make way westward when they have the prow towards the east do they go sideward or backward thats fortune answer he but so it be that they be mistake i reply that i have rather follow effect than reason now these be thing that often interfere with one another and i have be tell that in geometry which pretend to have gain the high point of certainty of all science there be inevitable demonstration find which subvert the truth of all experience a jacques pelletier tell me at my own house that he have find out two line stretch themselves one towards the other to meet which nevertheless he affirm though extend to infinity could never arrive to touch one another and the pyrrhonians make no other use of their argument and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience and ti a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason have follow them in this design of controvert the evidence of effect for they affirm that we do not move that we do not speak and that there be neither weight nor heat with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely thing ptolemy who be a great man have establish the bound of this world of ours all the ancient philosopher think they have the measure of it except some remote isle that might escape their knowledge it have be pyrrhonism a thousand year ago to doubt the science of cosmography and the opinion that every one have receive from it it be heresy to admit the antipode and behold in this age of ours there be an infinite extent of terra firma discover not an island or single country but a division of the world nearly equal in greatness to that we know before the geographer of our time stick not to assure u that now all be find all be see but it remain to be see whether a ptolemy be therein formerly deceive upon the foundation of hi reason it be not very foolish to trust now in what these people say and whether it be not more likely that this great body which we call the world be not quite another thing than what we imagine plato say that it change countenance in all respect that the heaven the star and the sun have all of them sometimes motion retrograde to what we see change east into west the egyptian priest tell herodotus that from the time of their first king which be eleven thousand and odd year since and they show him the effigy of all their king in statue take from the life the sun have four time alter hi course that the sea and the earth do alternately change into one another that the beginning of the world be undetermined aristotle and cicero both say the same and some amongst u be of opinion that it have be from all eternity be mortal and renew again by several vicissitude call solomon and isaiah to witness to evade those opposition that god have once be a creator without a creature that he have have nothing to do that he get rid of that idleness by put hi hand to this work and that consequently he be subject to change in the most famous of the greek school the world be take for a god make by another god great than he and compose of a body and a soul fix in hi centre and dilate himself by musical number to hi circumference divine infinitely happy and infinitely great infinitely wise and eternal in him be other god the sea the earth the star who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance sometimes meet sometimes retire from one another concealing and discover themselves change their order one while before and another behind heraclitus be positive that the world be compose of fire and by the order of destiny be one day to be enflamed and consume in fire and then to be again renew and apuleius say of men sigillatim mortal cunctim perpetui that they be mortal in particular and immortal in general alexander writ to hi mother the narration of an egyptian priest drawn from their monument testify the antiquity of that nation to be infinite and comprise the birth and progress of other country cicero and diodorus say that in their time the chaldee keep a register of four hundred thousand and odd year aristotle pliny and other that zoroaster flourish six thousand year before plato time plato say that they of the city of sais have record in writing of eight thousand year and that the city of athens be build a thousand year before the say city of sais epicurus that at the same time thing be here in the posture we see they be alike and in the same manner in several other world which he would have deliver with great assurance have he see the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the west indie with ours present and past in so many strange example in earnest consider what be come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity i have often wonder to see in so vast a distance of place and time such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinion and of savage manner and belief which by no mean seem to proceed from our natural meditation the human mind be a great worker of miracle but this relation have moreover i know not what of extraordinary in it tis find to be in name also and a thousand other thing for they find nation there that for aught we know never hear of u where circumcision be in use where there be state and great civil government maintain by woman only without men where our fast and lent be represent to which be add abstinence from woman where our cross be several way in repute here they be make use of to honour and adorn their sepulture there they be erect and particularly that of st andrew to protect themselves from nocturnal vision and to lay upon the cradle of infant against enchantment elsewhere there be find one of wood of very great height which be adore for the god of rain and this a great way in the interior there be see an express image of our penance priests the use of mitre the celibacy of priest the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beast abstinence from all sort of flesh and fish in their diet the manner of priest officiate in a particular and not a vulgar language and this fancy that the first god be drive away by a second hi younger brother that they be create with all sort of necessary and convenience which have since be in a degree take from them for their sin their territory change and their natural condition make bad that they be of old overwhelm by the inundation of water from heaven that but few family escape who retire into cave on high mountain the mouth of which they stop so that the water could not get in have shut up together with themselves several sort of animal that when they perceive the rain to cease they send out dog which return clean and wet they judge that the water be not much abate afterwards send out other and see them return dirty they issue out to repeople the world which they find only full of serpent in one place we meet with the belief of a day of judgment insomuch that they be marvellously displease at the spaniard for discompose the bone of the dead in rifle the sepulture for rich say that those bone so disorder could not easily rejoin the traffic by exchange and

to leave that which he have before another to strew lime upon the knee of the newborn child with these word from dust thou earnest and to dust thou must return a also the art of augury the vain shadow of our religion which be observable in some of these example be testimony of it dignity and divinity it be not only in some sort insinuate into all the infidel nation on this side of the world by a certain imitation but in these barbarian also a by a common and supernatural inspiration for we find there the belief of purgatory but of a new form that which we give to the fire they give to the cold and imagine that soul be purge and punish by the rigour of an excessive coldness and this example put me in mind of another pleasant diversityfor a there be there some people who delight to unmuffle the end of their instrument and clip off the prepuce after the mahometan and jewish manner there be other who make so great conscience of lay it bare that they carefully purse it up with little string to keep that end from peep into the air and of this other diversitythat whereas we to honour king and festival put on the best clothes we have in some region to express their disparity and submission to their king hi subject present themselves before him in their vilest habit and enter hi palace throw some old tattered garment over their good apparel to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him but to proceed if nature enclose within the bound of her ordinary progress the belief judgment and opinion of men as well a all other thing if they have their revolution their season their birth and death like cabbage plant if the heaven agitate and rule them at their pleasure what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them if we experimentally see that the form of our being depend upon the air upon the climate and upon the soil where we be bom and not only the colour the stature the complexion and the countenance but moreover the very faculty of the soul itself et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum sed etiam anirum facit the climate be of great efficacy not only to the strength of body but to that of soul also say vegetius and that the goddess who found the city of athens choose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent a the egyptian priest tell solon athenis tenue colum ex quo etiam acutiores putantur attici crassum thebis itaque pingues thebani et valent the air of athens be subtle and thin whence also the athenian be repute to be more acute and at thebe more gross and thick wherefore the theban be look upon a more heavywitted and more strong in such sort that a fruit and animal grow different men be also more or less warlike just temperate and docile here give to wine elsewhere to theft or uncleanness here incline to superstition elsewhere to unbelief in one place to liberty in another to servitude capable of one science or of one art dull or ingenious obedient or mutinous good or bad accord a the place where they be seat incline them and assume a new complexion if remove like tree which be the reason why cyrus would not grant the persian leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even say that fertile and tender soil make men effeminate and soft if we see one while one art and one belief flourish and another while another through some celestial influence such an age to produce such nature and to incline mankind to such and such a propension the spirit of men one while gay and another gray like our field what become of all those fine prerogative we so soothe ourselves withal see that a wise man may be mistake and a hundred men and a hundred nation nay that even human nature itself a we believe be many age wide in one thing or another what assurance have we that she should cease to be mistake or that in this very age of ours she be not so methinks that amongst other testimony of our imbecility this ought not to be forget that man can not by hi own wish and desire find out what he want that not in fruition only but in imagination and wish we can not agree about what we would have to satisfy and content u let u leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure it can not so much a covet what be proper for it and satisfy itself and therefore it be that socrates only beg of the god that they would give him what they know to be best for him and the private and public prayer of the lacedemonians be simply for good and useful thing refer the choice and election of them to the discretion of the supreme power and christian pray to god thy will be do that they may not fall into the inconvenience the poet feigns of king midas he pray to the god that all he touch might be turn into gold hi prayer be hear hi wine be gold hi bread be gold the feather of hi bed hi shirt hi clothes be all gold so that he find himself overwhelm with the fruition of hi desire and endow with an

require that he may throw you into a battle set you upon a cast at dice or something of the like nature whereof the issue be to you unknown and the fruit doubtful there be no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosopher a about the question of the sovereign good of man whence by the calculation of varro rise two hundred and eightyeight sect qui autem de summo bono dissentit de tot philosophy ration disputt for whoever enters into controversy concern the supreme good dispute upon the whole matter of philosophy nature should say the same to their contest and debate some say that our wellbeing lie in virtue other in pleasure other in submit to nature one in knowledge another in be exempt from pain another in not suffer ourselves to be carry away by appearance and this fancy seem to have some relation to that of the ancient pythagoras which be the drift of the pyrrhonian sect aristotle attribute the admire nothing to magnanimity and arcesilaus say that constancy and a right inflexible state of judgment be the true good and consent and application the sin and evil and there it be true in be thus positive and establish a certain axiom he quit pyrrhonism for the pyrrhonians when they say that ataraxy which be the immobility of judgment be the sovereign good do not design to speak it affirmatively but that the same motion of soul which make them avoid precipice and take shelter from the cold present them such a fancy and make them refuse another how much do i wish that whilst i live either some other or justus lipsius the most learned man now live of a most polite and judicious understand truly resemble my turnebus have both the will and health and leisure sufficient carefully and conscientiously to collect into a register accord to their division and class as many a be to be find of the opinion of the ancient philosopher about the subject of our be and manner their controversy the succession and reputation of sect with the application of the life of the author and their disciple to their own precept in memorable accident and upon exemplary occasion what a beautiful and useful work that would be a to what remain if it be from ourselves that we be to extract the rule of our manner upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves for that which our reason advise u to a the most likely be generally for every one to obey the law of hi country a be the advice of socrates inspire a he say by a divine counsel and by that what would it say but that our duty have no other rule but what be accidental truth ought to have a like and universal visage if man could know equity and justice that have a body and a true be he would not fetter it to the condition of this country or that it would not be from the whimsy of the persian or indian that virtue would receive it form there be nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the law since i be bear i have know those of the english our neighbour three or four time change not only in matter of civil regimen which be the only thing wherein constancy may be dispense with but in the most important subject that can be namely religion at which i be the more troubled and ashamed because it be a nation with whom those of my province have formerly have so great familiarity and acquaintance that there yet remain in my house some footstep of our ancient kindred and here with u at home i have know a thing that be capital to become lawful and we that hold of other be likewise accord to the chance of war in a possibility of be one day find guilty of hightreason both divine and human should the justice of our arm fall into the power of injustice and after a few year possession take a quite contrary be how could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concern the divine being and give men to understand that their religion be but a thing of their own contrivance useful a a bond to their society than declare a he do to those who come to hi tripod for instruction that every one true worship be that which he find in use in the place where he chance to be o god what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign creator for have disabuse our belief from these wander and arbitrary devotion and for have seat it upon the eternal foundation of hi holy word but what then will philosopher say to u in this necessity that we follow the law of our country that be to say this float sea of the opinion of a republic or a prince that will paint out justice for me in as many colour and form it a many way a there be change of passion in themselves i can not suffer my judgment to be so flexible what kind of virtue be that which i see one day in repute and that tomorrow shall be in none and which the crossing of a river make a crime what sort of truth can that be which these mountain limit to u and make a lie to all the world beyond them but they be pleasant when to give some certainty to the law they say that there be some firm perpetual and immovable which they call natural that be imprint in human kind by the condition of their own proper be and of these some reckon three some four some more some less a sign that it be a mark as doubtful a the rest now they be so unfortunate for what can i call it els but misfortune that of so infinite a number of law there should not be find one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance have suffer to be universally receive by the consent of all nation they be i say so miserable that of these three or four select law there be not so much a one that be not contradict and disown not only by one nation but by many now the only likely sign by which they can argue or infer some natural law be the universality of approbation for we should without doubt follow with a common consent that which nature have truly ordain u and not only every nation but every private man would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law but let them produce me one of this condition proctagoras and aristo give no other essence to the justice of law than the authority and opinion of the legislator and that these lay aside the honest and the good lose their quality and remain empty name of indifferent thing thrasymachus in plato be of opinion that there be no other right but the convenience of the superior there be not any thing wherein the world be so various a in law and custom such a thing be abominable here which be elsewhere in esteem a in lacedemon dexterity in steal marriage between near relation be capitally interdict amongst u they be elsewhere in honour the murder of infant the murder of father the community of wife traffic of robbery license in all sort of voluptuousness in short there be nothing so extreme that be not allow by the custom of some nation or other it be credible that there be natural law for u a we see them in other creature but they be lose in u this fine human reason everywhere so insinuate itself to govern and command a to shuffle and confound the face of thing accord to it own vanity and inconstancy nihil itaque amplius nostrum est quod nostrum dico artis est therefore nothing be any more truly ours what we call ours belongs to art subject have diver lustre and diver consideration and thence the diversityof opinion principally proceed one nation consider a subject in one aspect and stop there another take it in a different point of view there be nothing of great horror to be imagine than for a man to eat hi father and yet the people whose ancient custom it be so to do looked upon it a a testimony of piety and affection seek thereby to give their progenitor the most worthy and honourable sepulture store up in themselves and a it be in their own marrow the body and relic of their father and in some sort regenerate them by transmutation into their living flesh by mean of nourishment and digestion it be easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appear to men possess and imbue with this snperstition to throw their father remain to the corruption of the earth and the nourishment of beast and worm lycurgus consider in theft the vivacity diligence boldness and dexterity of purloin any thing from our neighbour and the benefit that redound to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what be hi own and believe that from this double institution of assault and defend advantage be to be make for military discipline which be the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation of great consideration than the disorder and injustice of take another man good dionysius the tyrant offer plato a robe of the persian fashion long damask and perfume plato refuse it say that be bear a man he would not willingly dress himself in woman clothes but aristippus accept it with this answer that no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage hi friend reproach him with meanness of spirit for lay it no more to heart that dionysius have spit in hi face fisherman say he suffer themselves to be drench with the wave of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon diogenes be wash cabbage and see him pas by if thou couldst live on cabbage say he thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant to whom aristippus reply and if thou knewest how to live amongst men thou wouldst not be wash cabbage thus reason find appearance for diver effect tis a pot with two ear that a man may take by the right or leave solon be lecture by hi friend not to shed powerless and unprofitable tear for the death of hi son it be for that reason that i the more justly shed them say he because they be powerless and unprofitable socrates wife exasperate her grief by this circumstance oh how unjustly do these wicked judge put him to death why reply he hadst thou rather they should execute me justly we have our ear bore the greek look upon that a a mark of slavery we retire in private to enjoy our wife the indian do it in public the scythian immolated stranger in their temple elsewhere temple be a refuge i have hear of a judge who come upon a sharp conflict betwixt bartolus and aldus and some point controvert with many contrariety writ in the margin of hi book a question for a friend that be to say that truth be there so controverted and dispute that in a like cause he might favour which of the party he think fit twas only for want of wit that he do not write a question for a friend throughout the advocate and judge of our time find bias enough in all cause to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit in so infinite a science depend upon the authority of so many opinion and so arbitrary a subject it can not be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgment must arise there be hardly any suit so clear wherein opinion do not very much differ what one court have determine one way another determine quite contrary and itself contrary to that at another time of which we see very frequent example owe to that practice admit amongst u and which be a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice of not abide by one sentence but run from judge to judge and court to court to decide one and the same cause a to the liberty of philosophical opinion concern vice and virtue ti not necessary to be insist upon therein be find many opinion that be good conceal than publish to weak mind arcesilaus say that in venery it be no matter where or with whom it be commit et obsccenas voluptates si natura requirit non genere aut loco aut ordine sed forma otate jigur metiendas epicurus putat ne amor quidem sanctos a sapient alienos ess arbitrantur queeramus ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint and obscene pleasure if nature require them epicurus think be not to be measure either by race kind place or rank but by age shape and beauty neither be sacred love think to be foreign to wise men we be to inquire till what age young men be to be love these last two stoical quotation and the reproach that dicarchus throw into the teeth of plato himself upon this account show how much the sound philosophy indulge license and excess very remote from common custom law derive their authority from possession and custom ti dangerous to trace them back to their beginning they grow great and ennoble themselves like our river by run on but follow them upward to their source ti but a little spring scarce discernable that swell thus and thus fortifies itself by grow old do but consult the ancient consideration that give the first motion to this famous torrent so full of dignity awe and reverence you will find them so light and weak that it be no wonder if these people who weigh and reduce every thing to reason and who admit nothing by authority or upon trust have their judgment often very remote and differ from those of the public it be no wonder if people who take their pattern from the first image of nature should in most of their opinion swerve from the common path a for example few amongst them would have approve of the strict condition of our marriage and most of them have be for have wife in common and without obligation they would refuse our ceremony chrysippus say that a philosopher would make a dozen somersault aye and without hi breech for a dozen of olive that philosopher would hardly have advise clisthenes to have refuse hippoclides the fair agarista hi daughter for have see him stand on hi head upon a table metrocles somewhat indiscreetly break wind backwards while in disputation in the presence of a great auditory in hi school and keep himself hid in hi own house for shame till crate come to visit him and add to hi consolation and reason the example of hi own liberty by fall to try with him who should sound most cured him of that scruple and withal draw him to hi own stoical sect more free than that more reserve one of the peripatetic of which he have be till then that which we call decency not to dare to do that in public which be decent enough to do in private the stoic call foppery and to mince it and to be so modest a to conceal and disown what nature custom and our desire publish and proclaim of our action they repute a vice the other think it be to undervalue the mystery of venus to draw them out of the private oratory to expose them to the view of the people and that to bring them out from behind the curtain be to debase them modesty be a thing of weight secrecy reservation and circumspection be part of esteem pleasure do very ingeniously when under the mask of virtue she sue not to be prostitute in the open street trodden under foot and expose to the public view want the dignity and convenience of her private cabinet hence some say that to put down public stew be not only to disperse fornication into all place that be confine to one but moreover by the difficulty to incite wild and idle people to this vice this experience diversify itself in a thousand examples a philosopher be take in the very act and ask what he be do coldly reply i be plant man no more blushing to be so caught than if they have find him plant garlic it be i suppose out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author be of opinion that this act be so necessarily oblige to privacy and shame that he can not persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embrace of the cynic but that they content themselves to represent lascivious gesture only to maintain the impudence of their school profession and that to eject what shame have withhold and restrain it be afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade but he have not thoroughly examine their debauch for diogenes play the beast with himself in public wish in the presence of all that saw him that he could fill hi belly by that exercise to those who ask him why he do not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street he make answer because i be hungry in the open street the woman philosopher who mix with their sect mixed also with their person in all place without reservation and hipparchia be not receive into crate society but upon condition that she should in all thing follow the practice and custom of hi rule these philosopher set a great price upon virtue and renounce all other discipline but the moral and yet in all their action they attribute the sovereign authority to the election of their sage and above the law and give no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only and the conservation of the liberty of other heraclitus and protagoras forasmuch a wine seem bitter to the sick and pleasant to the sound the rudder crook in the water and straight when out and such like contrary appearance a be find in subject argue thence that all subject have in themselves the cause of these appearance and there be some bitterness in the wine which have some sympathy with the sick man taste and the rudder some bending quality sympathize with him that look upon it in the water and so of all the rest which be to say that all be in all thing and consequently nothing in any one for where all be there be nothing this opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there be no sense or aspect of any thing whether bitter or sweet straight or crook that the human mind do not find out in the writing it undertake to tumble over into the cleanest purest and most perfect word that can possibly be how many lie and falsity have we suggest what heresy have not there find ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embrace and defend ti for this that the author of such error will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of word a person of dignity who would approve to me by authority the search of the philosopher stone wherein he be head over ear engage lately allege to me at least five or six passage of the bible upon which he say he first found hi attempt for the discharge of hi conscience for he be a divine and in truth the idea be not only pleasant but moreover very well accommodate to the defence of this fine science by this way the reputation of divine fable be acquire there be no fortuneteller if we have this authority but if a man will take the pain to tumble and toss and narrowly to peep into all the fold and gloss of hi word he may make him like the sibyl say what he will there be so many way of interpretation that it will be hard but that either obliquely or in a direct line an ingenious wit will find out in every subject some air that will serve for hi purpose therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use let the author but make himself master of that to busy posterity about hi prediction which not only hi own part but the accidental favour of the matter itself may do for him and a to the rest express himself whether after a foolish or a subtle manner somewhat obscurely or contradictorily tis no mattera number of wit shake and sift him will bring out a great many several form either accord to hi meaning or collateral or contrary to it which will all redound to hi honour he will see himself enrich by the mean of hi disciple like the regent of college by their pupil yearly present this it be which have give reputation to many thing of no worth at all that have bring several writing in vogue and give them the fame of contain all sort of matter can be desire one and the same thing receive a thousand and a thousand image and various consideration nay as many a we please be it possible that homer could design to say all that we make him say and that he design so many and so various figure a that the divine lawgiver captain philosopher and all sort of men who treat of science how variously and opposite soever should indifferently quote him and support their argument by hi authority a the sovereign lord and master of all office work and artisan and counsellorgeneral of all enterprise whoever have have occasion for oracle and prediction have there find sufficient to serve hi turn ti a wonder how many and how admirable concurrence an intelligent person and a particular friend of mine have there find out in favour of our religion and can not easily be put out of the conceit that it be homer design and yet he be as well acquaint with this author a any man whatever of hi time and what he have find in favour of our religion there very many anciently have find in favour of theirs do but observe how plato be tumble and toss about every one ennoble hi own opinion by apply him to himself and make him take what side they please they draw him in and engage him in all the new opinion the world receive and make him accord to the different course of thing differ from himself every one make him disavow accord to hi own sense the manner and custom lawful in hi age because they be unlawful in ours and all this with vivacity and power accord to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter from the same foundation that heraclitus and this sentence of hi have that all thing have in them those form that we discern democritus draw quite a contrary conclusionthat object have in them nothing that we discern in them and because honey be sweet to one and bitter to another he thence argue that it be neither sweet nor bitter the pyrrhonians would say that they know not whether it be sweet or bitter or whether the one or the other or both for these always gain the high point of dubitation the cyrenaics hold that nothing be perceptible from without and that that only be perceptible that inwardly touch u a pain and pleasure acknowledge neither sound nor colour but certain affection only that we receive from them and that man judgment have no other seat protagoras believe that what seem true to every one be true to every one the epicurean lodge all judgment in the sens and in the knowledge of thing and in pleasure plato would have the judgment of truth and truth itself derive from opinion and the sens to belong to the wit and cogitation this discourse have put me upon the consideration of the sens in which lie the great foundation and prof of our ignorance whatsoever be know be doubtless know by the faculty of the knower for see the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judge tis reason that this operation be perform by hi mean and will not by the constraint of another a it would happen if we know thing by the power and accord to the law of their essence now all knowledge be convey to u by the sens they be our master science begin by them and be resolve into them after all we should know no more than a stone if we do not know there be sound odour light taste measure weight softness hardness sharpness colour smoothness breadth and depth these be the platform and principle of the structure of all our knowledge and accord to some science be nothing els but sense he that could make me contradict the sens would have me by the throat he could not make me go far back the sens be the beginning and the end of human knowledge let u attribute to them the least we can we must however of necessity grant them this that it be by their mean and mediation that all our instruction be direct cicero say that chrysippus have attempt to extenuate the force and virtue of the sens present to himself argument and so vehement opposition to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein whereupon cameades who maintain the contrary side boast that he would make use of the very word and argument of chrysippus to controvert and confute him and therefore thus cry out against him o miserable thy force have destroy thee there can be nothing absurd to a great degree than to maintain that fire do not warm that light do not shine and that there be no weight nor solidity in iron which be thing convey to u by the sens neither be there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compare to that for certainty the first consideration i have upon the subject of the sens be that i make a doubt whether or no man be furnish with all natural sens i see several animal who live an entire and perfect life some without sight other without hear who know whether to u also one two three or many other sens may not be want for if any one be want our examination can not discover the defect ti the privilege of the sens to be the utmost limit of our discovery there be nothing beyond them that can assist u in exploration not so much a one sense in the discovery of another they all make the extreme limit of our ability it be impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he do not see impossible to make him desire sight or to regret hi defect for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul be content and satisfy with those we have consider that it can not be sensible herein of it infirmity and imperfection if there be any such thing it be impossible to say any thing to this blind man either by reason argument or similitude that can possess hi imagination with any apprehension of light colour or sight there nothing remain behind that can push on the sens to evidence those that be bear blind whom we hear wish they could see it be not that they understand what they desire they have learn from u that they want something that there be something to be desire that we have which they can name indeed and speak of it effect and consequence but yet they know not what it be nor apprehend it at all i have see a gentleman of a good family who be bear blind or at least blind from such an age that he know not what sight be who be so little sensible of hi defect that he make use a we do of word proper for see and applies them after a manner wholly particular and hi own they bring him a child to which he be godfather which have take into hi arm good god say he what a fine child how beautiful to look upon what a pretty face it have he will say like one of u this room have a very fine prospectit be clear weatherthe sun shine bright and moreover be that hunt tennis and butt be our exercise and he have hear so he have take a liking to them will ride ahunting and believe he have as good share of the sport a we have and will express himself a angry or pleased a the best of u all and yet know nothing of it but by the ear one cry out to him heres a hare when he be upon some even plain where he may safely ride and afterwards when they tell him the hare be kill he will be a overjoyed and proud of it a he hear other say they be he will take a tennisball in hi left hand and strike it away with the racket he will shoot with a harquebus at random and be content with what hi people tell him that he be over or wide who know whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity for want of some sense and that through this default the great part of the face of thing be conceal from u what do we know but that the difficulty which we find in several work of nature proceed hence and that several effect of animal which exceed our capacity be not produce by faculty of some sense that we be defective in and whether some of them have not by this mean a life more full and entire than ours we seize an apple with all our sens we there find redness smoothness odour and sweetness but it may have other virtue besides these a to heat or bind which no sense of ours can have any reference unto be it not likely that there be sensitive faculty in nature that be fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult property in several thing a for the loadstone to attract iron and that the want of such faculty be the cause that we be ignorant of the true essence of such thing ti perhaps some particular sense that give cock to understand what hour it be at midnight and when it grow to be towards day and that make them crow accordingly that teach chicken before they have any experience of the matter to fear a sparrowhawk and not a goose or a peacock though bird of a much large size that caution them against the hostile quality the cat have against them and make them not to fear a dog to arm themselves against the mew a kind of flatter voice of the one and not against the bark a shrill and threatening voice of the other that teach wasps ant and rat to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have taste them and inspire the stag elephant and serpent with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure there be no sense that have not a mighty dominion and that do not by it power introduce an infinite number of knowledge if we be defective in the intelligence of sound of harmony and of the voice it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science for besides what belong to the proper effect of every sense how many argument consequence and conclusion do we draw to other thing by compare one sense with another let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produce without the sense of see and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him what a darkness and blindness in the soul he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense or of two or three should we be so deprive would be we have form a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five sens but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in it essence the sect that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our sens for since all knowledge be by their mean and mediation convey unto u if they fail in their report if they corrupt or alter what they bring u from without if the light which by them creep into the soul be obscure in the passage we have nothing els to hold by from this extreme difficulty all these fancy proceed that every subject have in itself all we there find that it have nothing in it of what we think we there find and that of the epicurean that the sun be no big than ti judge by our sight to be that the appearance which represent a body great to him that be near and less to him that be more remote be both true and resolutely that there be no deceit in the sens that we be to lie at their mercy and seek elsewhere reason to excuse the difference and contradiction we there find even to the inventing of lie and other flams if it come to that rather than accuse the sens timagoras vow that by press or turn hi eye he could never perceive the light of the candle to double and that the seem so proceed from the vice of opinion and not from the instrument the most absurd of all absurdity with the epicurean be to deny the force and effect of the sens this so desperate and unphilosophical advice express only thisthat human knowledge can not support itself but by reason unreasonable foolish and mad but that it be yet good that man to set a great value upon himself make use of any other remedy how fantastic soever than to confess hi necessary ignorancea truth so disadvantageous to him he can not avoid own that the sens be the sovereign lord of hi knowledge but they be uncertain and falsifiable in all circumstance tis there that he be to fight it out to the last and if hi just force fail him a they do to supply that defect with obstinacy temerity and impudence in case what the epicurean say be true viz that we have no knowledge if the sens appearance be false and if that also be true which the stoic say that the appearance of the sens be so false that they can furnish u with no manner of knowledge we shall conclude to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sect that there be no science at all a to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the sens every one may furnish himself with as many example a he please so ordinary be the fault and trick they put upon u in the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seem to meet u which come from a place behind take a musketball under the forefinger the middle finger be lap over it it feel so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there be but one the end of the two finger feel each of them one at the same time for that the sens be very often master of our reason and constrain it to receive impression which it judge and know to be false be frequently see i set aside the sense of feeling that have it function nearer more lively and substantial that so often by the effect of the pain it help the body to subverts and overthrow all those fine stoical resolution and compels him to cry out of hi belly who have resolutely establish this doctrine in hi soulthat the colic and all other pain and disease be indifferent thing not have the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man be seat by hi virtue there be no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drum and trumpet will not inflame with courage nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself strike with some reverence in consider the gloomy vastness of our church the variety of ornament and order of our ceremony and in hear the solemn music of our organ and the grace and devout harmony of our voice even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their heart and something of dread that make them begin to doubt their opinion for my part i do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of horace or catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion and zeno have reason to say that the voice be the flower of beauty one would once make me believe that a certain person whom all we frenchman know have impose upon me in repeat some verse that he have make that they be not the same upon paper that they be in the air and that my eye would make a contrary judgment to my ear so great a power have pronunciation to give fashion and value to work that be leave to the efficacy and modulation of the voice and therefore philoxenus be not so much to blame hear one give an ill accent to some composition of hi in spurning and break certain earthen vessel of hi say i break what be thine because thou corruptest what be mine to what end do those men who have with a firm resolution destroy themselves turn away their face that they might not see the blow that be by themselves appoint and that those who for their health desire and command incision to be make and cautery to be apply to them can not endure the sight of the preparation instrument and operation of the surgeon be that the sight be not in any way to participate in the pain are not these proper example to verify the authority the sens have over the imagination ti to much purpose that we know these tress be borrow from a page or a lackey that this rouge come from spain and this pearlpowder from the ocean sea our sight will nevertheless compel u to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason for in this there be nothing of it own what a strange power do the poet attribute to the sens that make narcissus so desperately in love with hi own shadow and pygmalion judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of hi ivory statue that he love and adore it a if it be a living woman put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bar of iron hang him on the top of the high tower of notre dame at paris he will see by manifest reason that he can not possibly fall and yet he will find unless he have be use to the plumber trade that he can not help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the gallery of our steeple if they be make with open work although they be of stone and some there be that can not endure so much a to think of it let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two tower of breadth sufficient to walk upon there be no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give u the courage to walk over it a we should do upon the ground i have often try this upon our mountain in these part and though i be one who be not the most subject to be afraid i be not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and tremble though i stand above my length from the edge of the precipice and could not have fall unless i would where i also observe that what height soever the precipice be provide there be some tree or some jut out of a rock a little to support and divide the sight it a little ease our fear and give great assurance a if they be thing by which in fall we might have some relief but that direct precipice we be not to look upon without be giddy ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit to that one can not look without dizziness which be a manifest imposture of the sight and therefore it be that that fine philosopher put out hi own eye to free the soul from be divert by them and that he might philosophize at great liberty but by the same rule he should have dam up hi ear that theophrastus say be the most dangerous instrument about u for receive violent impression to alter and disturb u and finally should have deprive himself of all hi other sens that be to say of hi life and be for they have all the power to command our soul and reason fit etiam sope specie qudam sope vocum gravitate et cantibus ut pettantur animi vehementius sope etiam cura et timor for it often fall out that the mind be more vehemently strike by some sight by the quality and sound of the voice or by sing and ofttimes also by grief and fear physician hold that there be certain complexion that be agitate by the same sound and instrument even to fury i have see some who could not hear a bone gnaw under the table without impatience and there be scarce any man who be not disturb at the sharp and shrill noise that the file make in grate upon the iron a also to hear chew near them or to hear any one speak who have an impediment in the throat or nose will move some people even to anger and hatred of what use be that pip prompter of gracchus who soften raise and move hi master voice whilst he declaim at rome if the movement and quality of the sound have not the power to move and alter the judgment of the auditory in earnest there be wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece that suffer itself to be turn and twin by the motion and accident of so light a wind the same cheat that the sens put upon our understand they have in turn put upon them the soul also some time have it revenge they lie and contend which should most deceive one another what we see and hear when we be transport with passion we neither see nor hear a it be the object that we love appear to u more beautiful than it really be and that we hate more ugly to a discontent and afflict man the light of the day seem dark and overcast our sens be not only depraved but very often stupefy by the passion of the soul how many thing do we see that we do not take notice of if the mind be occupy with other thought it would appear that the soul retire within and amuse the power of the sens and so both the inside and the outside of man be full of infirmity and falsehood they who have compare our life to a dream be perhaps more in the right than they be aware of when we dream the soul live work and exercise all it faculty neither more nor less than when awake but more largely and obscurely yet not so much neither that the difference should be as great a betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun but a betwixt night and shade there she sleep here she slumber but whether more or less ti still dark and cimmerian darkness we wake sleep and sleep waking i do not see so clearly in my sleep but a to my be awake i never find it clear enough and free from clouds moreover sleep when it be profound sometimes rock even dream themselves asleep but our waking be never so sprightly that it rightly purge and dissipate those whimsy which be wake dream and bad than dream our reason and soul receive those fancy and opinion that come in dream and authorize the action of our dream with the like approbation that they do those of the day wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought our action be not another sort of dreaming and our wake a certain kind of sleep if the sens be our first judge it be not ours that we be alone to consult for in this faculty beast have as great or great than we it be certain that some of them have the sense of hear more quick than man other that of see other that of feel other that of touch and taste democritus say that the god and brute have the sensitive faculty more perfect than man but betwixt the effect of their sens and ours the difference be extreme our spittle clean and dry up our wound it kill the serpent what quality shall we attribute to our spittle a it affect ourselves or a it affect the serpent by which of the two sens shall we prove the true essence that we seek for pliny say there be certain seahares in the indie that be poison to u and we to them insomuch that with the least touch we kill them which shall be truly poison the man or the fish which shall we believe the fish of the man or the man of the fish one quality of the air infect a man that do the ox no harm some other infects the ox but hurt not the man which of the two shall in truth and nature be the pestilent quality to them who have the jaundice all thing seem yellow and paler than to u they who be trouble with the disease that the physician call hyposphagmawhich be a suffusion of blood under the skinsee all thing red and bloody what do we know but that these humour which thus alter the operation of sight predominate in beast and be usual with them for we see some whose eye be yellow like u who have the jaundice and other of a bloody colour ti likely that the colour of object seem other to them than to u which of the two shall make a right judgment for it be not say that the essence of thing have a relation to man only hardness whiteness depth and sharpness have reference to the service and knowledge of animal as well a to u and nature have equally design them for their use when we press down the eye the body that we look upon we perceive to be long and more extendedmany beast have their eye so press down this length therefore be perhaps the true form of that body and not that which our eye give it in the usual state if we close the low part of the eye thing appear double to u if our ear be hinder or the passage stop with any thing we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do animal likewise who have either the ear hairy or but a very little hole instead of an ear do not consequently hear a we do but receive another kind of sound we see at festival and theatre that oppose a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeau all thing in the place appear to u green yellow or violet ti likely that the eye of animal which we see to be of diver colour produce the appearance of body the same with their eye we should therefore to make a right judgment of the opposition of the sens be first agree with beast and secondly amongst ourselves which we by no mean be but enter into dispute every time that one hear see or taste something otherwise than another do and contest as much a upon any other thing about the diversityof the image that the sens represent to u a child by the ordinary rule of nature hears see and talk otherwise than a man of thirty year old and he than one of threescore the sens be in some more obscure and dusky and more open and quick in other we receive thing variously accord a we be and accord a they appear to u those ring which be cut out in the form of feather which be call endless feather no eye can discern their size or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge and on the other contract and come so a point even when the ring be be turn round the finger yet when you feel them they seem all of an equal size now our perception be so uncertain and so controverted it be no more a wonder if we be tell that we may declare that snow appear white to u but that to affirm that it be in it own essence really so be more than we be able to justify and this foundation be shake all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin what do our sens themselves hinder one another a picture seem raise and emboss to the sight in the handling it seem flat to the touch shall we say that musk which delight the smell and be offensive to the taste be agreeable or no there be herb and unguent proper for one part o the body that be hurtful to another honey be pleasant to the taste but offensive to the sight they who to assist their lust use in ancient time to make use of magnifyingglasses to represent the member they be to employ big by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more to which of their sens do they give the prizewhether to the sight that represent the member a large and great a they would desire or to the feeling which represent them little and contemptible are they our sens that supply the subject with these different condition and have the subject themselves nevertheless but one a we see in the bread we eat it be nothing but bread but by be eat it become bone blood flesh hair and nail the humidity suck up by the root of a tree becomes trunk leaf and fruit and the air be but one be modulate in a trumpet to a thousand sort of sound be they our sens i would fain know that in like manner form these subject into so many diver quality or have they them really such in themselves and upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence moreover since the accident of disease of rave or sleep make thing appear otherwise to u than they do to the healthful the wise and those that be awake be it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding and our natural humour have also wherewith to give a be to thing that have a relation to their own condition and accommodate them to themselves as well a when they be disorderedthat health be a capable of give them an aspect a sickness why have not the temperate a certain form of object relative to it as well a the intemperate and why may it not as well stamp it with it own character a the other he whose mouth be out of taste say the wine be flat the healthful man commend it flavour and the thirsty it briskness now our condition always accommodate thing to itself and transform them accord to it own posture we can not know what thing truly be in themselves see that nothing come to u but what be falsify and alter by the sens where the compass the square and the rule be crook all proposition draw thence and all building erect by those guide must of necessity be also defective the uncertainty of our sens render every thing uncertain that they produce a to what remain who can be fit to judge of and to determine those difference a we say in controversy of religion that we must have a judge neither incline to the one side nor the other free from all choice and affection which can not be amongst christian just so it fall out in this for if he be old he can not judge of the sense of old age be himself a party in the case if young there be the same exception if healthful sick asleep or awake he be still the same incompetent judge we must have some one exempt from all these proposition a of thing indifferent to him and by this rule we must have a judge that never be to judge of the appearance that we receive of subject we ought t have a decide instrument to verify this instrument we must have demonstration to verify this demonstration an instrument and here we be round again upon the wheel and no far advanced see the sens can not determine our dispute be full of uncertainty themselves it must then be reason that must do it but no reason can be erect upon any other foundation than that of another reason and so we run back to all infinity our fancy do not apply itself to thing that be strange but be conceive by the mediation of the sens and the sens do not comprehend a foreign subject but only their own passion by which mean fancy and appearance be no part of the subject but only of the passion and sufferance of sense which passion and subject be different thing wherefore whoever judge by appearance judge by another thing than the subject and to say that the passion of the sens convey to the soul the quality of foreign subject by resemblance how can the soul and understanding be assure of this resemblance have of itself no commerce with foreign subject a they who never know socrates can not when they see hi picture say it be like him now whoever would notwithstanding judge by appearance if it be by all it be impossible because they hinder one another by their contrariety and discrepancy a we by experience see shall some select appearance govern the rest you must verify this select by another select the second by a third and thus there will never be any end to it finally there be no constant existence neither of the object be nor our own both we and our judgment and all mortal thing be evermore incessantly run and roll and consequently nothing certain can be establish from the one to the other both the judging and the judged be in a continual motion and mutation we have no communication with be by reason that all human nature be always in the middle betwixt be bom and die give but an obscure appearance and shadow a weak and uncertain opinion of itself and if perhaps you fix your thought to apprehend your be it would be but like grasping water for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what be in it own nature flow so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold so see that all thing be subject to pas from one change to another reason that there look for a real substance find itself deceive not be able to apprehend any thing that be subsist and permanent because that every thing be either enter into be and be not yet arrive at it or begin to die before it be bom plato say that body have never any existence but only birth conceive that homer have make the ocean and thetis father and mother of the god to show u that all thing be in a perpetual fluctuation motion and variation the opinion of all the philosopher a he say before hi time parmenides only except who would not allow thing to have motion on the power whereof he set a mighty value pythagoras be of opinion that all matter be flow and unstable the stoic that there be no time present and that what we call so be nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past heraclitus that never any man enter twice into the same river epicharmus that he who borrow money but an hour ago do not owe it now and that he who be invite overnight to come the next day to dinner come nevertheless uninvited consider that they be no more the same men but be become other and that there could not a mortal substance be find twice in the same condition for by the suddenness and quickness of the change it one while disperses and another reunite it come and go after such a manner that what begin to be bear never arrive to the perfection of be forasmuch a that birth be never finish and never stay a be at an end but from the seed be evermore changing and shift one to another a human seed be first in the mother womb make a formless embryo after deliver thence a sucking infant afterwards it become a boy then a youth then a man and at last a decrepit old man so that age and subsequent generation be always destroy and spoil that which go before and yet we foolishly fear one kind of death whereas we have already pass and do daily pass so many other for not only a heraclitus say the death of fire be generation of air and the death of air generation of water but moreover we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves manhood dy and pass away when age come on and youth be terminate in the flower of age of a fullgrown man infancy in youth and the first age dy in infancy yesterday die in today and today will die in tomorrow and there be nothing that remain in the same state or that be always the same thing and that it be so let this be the proof if we be always one and the same how come it to pass that we be now pleased with one thing and by and by with another how come it to pass that we love or hate contrary thing that we praise or condemn them how come it to pass that we have different affection and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought for it be not likely that without mutation we should assume other passion and that which suffer mutation do not remain the same and if it be not the same it be not at all but the same that the be be do like it unknowingly change and alter become evermore another from another thing and consequently the natural sens abuse and deceive themselves take that which seem for that which be for want of well know what that which be be but what be it then that truly be that which be eternal that be to say that never have begin nor never shall have end and to which time can bring no mutation for time be a mobile thine and that appear as in a shadow with a matter evermore flow and run without ever remain stable and permanent and to which belong those word before and after have be or shall be which at the first sight evidently show that it be not a thing that be for it be a great folly and a manifest falsity to say that that be which be not et be or that have already cease to be and a to these word present instant and now by which it seem that we principally support and find the intelligence of time reason discover do presently destroy it for it immediately divide and split it into the future and past be of necessity to consider it divide in two the same happen to nature that be measure a to time that measure it for she have nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other but all thing be either born bearing or die so that it be sinful to say of god who be he only who be that he be or that he shall be for those be term of declension transmutation and vicissitude of what can not continue or remain in be wherefore we be to conclude that god alone be not accord to any measure of time but accord to an immutable and an immovable eternity not measure by time nor subject to any declension before whom nothing be and after whom nothing shall be either more new or more recent but a real be that with one sole now fill the for ever and that there be nothing that truly be but he alone without our be able to say he have be or shall be without begin and without end to this so religious conclusion of a pagan i shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition for the close of this long and tedious discourse which would furnish me with endless matter what a vile and abject thing say he be man if he do not raise himself above humanity ti a good word and a profitable desire but withal absurd for to make the handle big than the hand the cubic long than the arm and to hope to stride far than our leg can reach be both impossible and monstrous or that man should rise above himself and humanity for he can not see but with hi eye nor seize but with hi hold he shall be exalt if god will lend him an extraordinary hand he shall exalt himself by abandon and renounce hi own proper mean and by suffer himself to be raise and elevate by mean purely celestial it belong to our christian faith and not to the stoical virtue to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis when we judge of anothers assurance in death which without doubt be the most remarkable action of human life we be to take heed of one thing which be that men very hardly believe themselves to have arrive to that period few men come to die in the opinion that it be their late hour and there be nothing wherein the flattery of hope more deludes u it never cease to whisper in our ear other have be much sicker without die your condition be not so desperate a ti thought and at the bad god have do other miracle which happens by reason that we set too much value upon ourselves it seem a if the universality of thing be in some measure to suffer by our dissolution and that it commiserate our condition forasmuch a our disturbed sight represent thing to itself erroneously and that we be of opinion they stand in as much need of u a we do of them like people at sea to whom mountain field city heaven and earth be toss at the same rate a they be whoever saw old age that do not applaud the past and condemn the present time lay the fault of hi misery and discontent upon the world and the manner of men we will make all thing go along with u whence it follow that we consider our death a a very great thing and that do not so easily pass nor without the solemn consultation of the star and so much the more think it a we more value ourselves what shall so much knowledge be lose with so much damage to the world without a particular concern of the destiny doe so rare and exemplary a soul cost no more the killing than one that be common and of no use to the public this life that protect so many other upon which so many other life depend that employ so vast a number of men in hi service that fill so many place shall it drop off like one that hang but by it own simple thread none of u lay it enough to heart that he be but one thence proceed those word of caesar to hi pilot more tumid than the sea that threaten him and these and that idle fancy of the public that the sun bore on hi face mourn for hi death a whole year and a thousand of the like wherewith the world suffer itself to be so easily impose upon believe that our interest affect the heaven and that their infinity be concern at our ordinary action now to judge of constancy and resolution in a man who do not yet believe himself to be certainly in danger though he really be be not reason and ti not enough that he die in this posture unless he purposely put himself into it for this effect it commonly fall out in most men that they set a good face upon the matter and speak with great indifference to acquire reputation which they hope afterwards live to enjoy of all whom i have see die fortune have dispose their countenance and no design of theirs and even of those who in ancient time have make away with themselves there be much to be consider whether it be a sudden or a lingering death that cruel roman emperor would say of hi prisoner that he would make them feel death and if any one kill himself in prison that fellow have make an escape from me he would prolong death and make it felt by torment in plain truth it be no such great matter for a man in health and in a temperate state of mind to resolve to kill himself it be very easy to play the villain before one come to the point insomuch that heliogabalus the most effeminate man in the world amongst hi low sensuality could forecast to make himself die delicately when he should be force thereto and that hi death might not give the lie to the rest of hi life have purposely build a sumptuous tower the front and base of which be cover with plank enrich with gold and precious stone thence to precipitate himself and also cause cord twist with gold and crimson silk to be make wherewith to strangle himself and a sword with the blade of gold to be hammer out to fall upon and keep poison in vessel of emerald and topaz wherewith to poison himself accord a he should like to choose one of these way of die yet in respect of this person the effeminacy of hi preparation make it more likely that he would have think good ont have he be put to the test but in those who with great resolution have determine to despatch themselves we must examine whether it be with one blow which take away the leisure of feel the effect for it be to be question whether perceive life by little and little to steal away the sentiment of the body mix itself with that of the soul and the mean of repent be offer whether i say constancy and obstinacy in so dangerous an intention would have be find in the civil war of caesar lucius domitius be take in the abruzzi and thereupon poison himself afterwards repent it have happen in our time that a certain person be resolve to die and not have go deep enough at the first thrust the sensibility of the flesh oppose hi arm give himself two or three wound more but could never prevail upon himself to thrust home whilst plautius silvanus be upon hi trial urgulania hi grandmother send him a poniard with which not be able to kill himself he make hi servant cut hi vein albucilla in tiberius time have to kill himself struck with too much tenderness give hi adversary opportunity to imprison and put him to death their own way and that great leader demosthenes after hi rout in sicily do the same and c fimbria have strike himself too weakly entreat hi servant to despatch him on the contrary ostorius who could not make use of hi own arm disdain to employ that of hi servant to any other use but only to hold the poniard straight and firm and bring hi throat to it thrust himself through ti in truth a morsel that be to be swallow without chew unless a man be thoroughly resolve and yet adrian the emperor make hi physician mark and encircle on hi pap the mortal place wherein he be to stab to whom he have give order to kill him for this reason it be that caesar be ask what death he think to be the most desired make answer the least premeditated and the short if caesar dare to say it it be no cowardice in me to believe it a short death say pliny be the sovereign good hap of human life people do not much care to recognise it no one can say that he be resolute for death who fear to deal with it and can not undergo it with hi eye open they whom we see in criminal punishment run to their death and hasten and press their execution do it not out of resolution but because they will not give them selves leisure to consider it it do not trouble them to be dead but to die tis a degree of constancy to which i have experiment that i can arrive like those who plunge into danger a into the sea with their eye shut there be nothing in my opinion more illustrious in the life of socrates than that he have thirty whole day wherein to ruminate upon the sentence of hi death to have digest it all that time with a most assured hope without care and without alteration and with a series of word and action rather careless and indifferent than any way stir or discompose by the weight of such a thought that pomponius atticus to whom cicero write so often be sick cause agrippa hi soninlaw and two or three more of hi friend to be call to him and tell them that have find all mean practise upon him for hi recovery to be in vain and that all he do to prolong hi life also prolong and augment hi pain he be resolve to put an end both to the one and the other desire them to approve of hi determination or at least not to lose their labour in endeavour to dissuade him now have choose to destroy himself by abstinence hi disease be thereby cure the remedy that he have make use of to kill himself restore him to health hi physician and friend rejoice at so happy an event and come to congratulate him found themselves very much deceive it be impossible for them to make him alter hi purpose he tell them that a he must one day die and be now so far on hi way he would save himself the labour of begin another time this man have survey death at leisure be not only not discourage at it approach but eagerly seek it for be content that he have engage in the combat he make it a point of bravery to see the end ti far beyond not fear death to taste and relish it the story of the philosopher cleanthes be very like this he have hi gum swell and rotten hi physician advise him to great abstinence have fast two day he be so much good that they pronounce him cure and permit him to return to hi ordinary course of diet he on the contrary already taste some sweetness in this faintness of hi would not be persuade to go back but resolve to proceed and to finish what he have so far advanced tullius marcellinus a young man of rome have a mind to anticipate the hour of hi destiny to be rid of a disease that be more trouble to him than he be willing to endure though hi physician assure him of a certain though not sudden cure call a council of hi friend to deliberate about it of whom some say seneca give him the counsel that out of unmanliness they would have take themselves other out of flattery such a they think he would best like but a stoic say this to him do not concern thyself marcellinus a if thou didst deliberate of a thing of importance ti no great matter to live thy servant and beast live but it be a great thing to die handsomely wisely and firmly do but think how long thou hast do the same thing eat drink and sleep drink sleep and eat we incessantly wheel in the same circle not only ill and insupportable accident but even the satiety of living incline a man to desire to die marcellinus do not stand in need of a man to advise but of a man to assist him hi servant be afraid to meddle in the business but this philosopher give them to under stand that domestic be suspect even when it be in doubt whether the death of the master be voluntary or no otherwise that it would be of a ill example to hinder him a to kill him forasmuch a he then tell marcellinus that it would not be unbecoming a what be leave on the table when we have eat be give to the attendant so life be end to distribute something to those who have be our servant now marcellinus be of a free and liberal spirit he therefore divide a certain sum of money amongst hi servant and console them a to the rest he have no need of steel nor of blood he resolve to go out of this life and not to run out of it not to escape from death but to essay it and to give himself leisure to deal with it have forsake all manner of nourishment the third day follow after have cause himself to be sprinkle with warm water he faint by degree and not without some kind of pleasure a he himself declare in fact such a have be acquaint with these faintings proceed from weakness say that they be therein sensible of no manner of pain but rather feel a kind of delight a in the passage to sleep and best these be study and digest death but to the end that cato only may furnish out the whole example of virtue it seem a if hi good with which the leisure to confront and struggle with death reinforce hi destiny have put hi ill one into the hand he give himself the blow seeing he have courage in the danger instead of let it go less and if i have have to represent him in hi supreme station i should have do it in the posture of tear out hi bloody bowels rather than with hi sword in hi hand a do the statuary of hi time for this second murder be much more furious than the first ti a pleasant imagination to fancy a mind exactly balance betwixt two equal desire for doubtless it can never pitch upon either forasmuch a the choice and application would manifest an inequality of esteem and be we set betwixt the bottle and the ham with an equal appetite to drink and eat there would doubtless be no remedy but we must die of thirst and hunger to provide against this inconvenience the stoic when they be ask whence the election in the soul of two indifferent thing proceeds and that make u out of a great number of crown rather take one than another they be all alike and there be no reason to incline u to such a preference make answer that this movement of the soul be extraordinary and irregular enter into u by a foreign accidental and fortuitous impulse it might rather methinks he say that nothing present itself to u wherein there be not some difference how little soever and that either by the sight or touch there be always some choice that though it be imperceptibly tempts and attract u so whoever shall presuppose a packthread equally strong throughout it be utterly impossible it should break for where will you have the breaking to begin and that it should break altogether be not in nature whoever also should hereunto join the geometrical proposition that by the certainty of their demonstration conclude the contain to be great than the contain the centre to be as great a it circumference and that find out two line incessantly approach each other which yet can never meet and the philosopher stone and the quadrature of the circle where the reason and the effect be so opposite might peradventure find some argument to second this bold saying of pliny there be no reason that have not it contrary say the wise of the philosopher i be just now ruminate on the excellent say one of the ancient allege for the contempt of life no good can bring pleasure unless it be that for the loss of which we be beforehand prepared meaning by this that the fruition of life can not be truly pleasant to u if we be in fear of lose it it might however be say on the contrary that we hug and embrace this good so much the more earnestly and with so much great affection by how much we see it the less assured and fear to have it take from u for it be evident a fire burn with great fury when cold come to mix with it that our will be more obstinate by be oppose and that there be nothing naturally so contrary to our taste a satiety which proceed from facility nor anything that so much whets it a rarity and difficulty to keep love in breath lycurgus make a decree that the married people of lacedaemon should never enjoy one another but by stealth and that it should be a great a shame to take them in bed together a commit with other the difficulty of assignation the danger of surprise the shame of the morning these be what give the piquancy to the sauce how many very wantonly pleasant sport spring from the most decent and modest language of the work on love pleasure itself seek to be heighten with pain it be much sweet when it smart and have the skin ripple the courtesan flora say she never lay with pompey but that she make him wear the print of her teeth and so it be in everything difficulty give all thing their estimation the people of the march of ancona more readily make their vow to st james and those of galicia to our lady of loreto they make wonderful todo at liege about the bath of lucca and in tuscany about those of aspa there be few roman see in the fencing school of rome which be full of french that great cato also as much a u nauseate hi wife whilst she be hi and long for her when in the possession of another i be fain to turn out into the paddock an old horse a he be not to be govern when he smelt a mare the facility presently sate him a towards hi own but towards strange mare and the first that pass by the pale of hi pasture he would again fall to hi importunate neighings and hi furious heat a before our appetite contemns and pass by what it have in possession to run after that it have not to forbid u anything be to make u have a mind tot to give it wholly up to u be to beget in u contempt want and abundance fall into the same inconvenience desire and fruition equally afflict u the rigor of mistress be troublesome but facility to say truth still more so forasmuch a discontent and anger spring from the esteem we have of the thing desire heat and actuate love but satiety begets disgust tis a blunt dull stupid tire and slothful passion why do poppea invent the use of a mask to hide the beauty of her face but to enhance it to her lover why have they veil even below the heel those beauty that every one desire to show and that every one desire to see why do they cover with so many hindrance one over another the part where our desire and their own have their principal seat and to what serve those great bastion farthingale with which our lady fortify their haunch but to allure our appetite and to draw u on by remove them far from u to what use serve the artifice of this virgin modesty this grave coldness this severe countenance this professing to be ignorant of thing that they know good than we who instruct them in them but to increase in u the desire to overcome control and trample underfoot at pleasure all this ceremony and all these obstacle for there be not only pleasure but moreover glory in conquer and debauch that soft sweetness and that childish modesty and to reduce a cold and matronlike gravity to the mercy of our ardent desire tis a glory say they to triumph over modesty chastity and temperance and whoever dissuades lady from those quality betray both them and himself we be to believe that their heart tremble with affright that the very sound of our word offend the purity of their ear that they hate u for talk so and only yield to our importunity by a compulsive force beauty all powerful a it be have not wherewithal to make itself relish without the mediation of these little art look into italy where there be the most and the fine beauty to be sell how it be necessitate to have recourse to extrinsic mean and other artifice to render itself charm and yet in truth whatever it may do be venal and public it remain feeble and languish even so in virtue itself of two like effect we notwithstanding look upon that a the fair and most worthy wherein the most trouble and hazard be set before u tis an effect of the divine providence to suffer the holy church to be afflict a we see it with so many storm and trouble by this opposition to rouse pious soul and to awaken them from that drowsy lethargy wherein by so long tranquillity they have be immerged if we should lay the loss we have sustain in the number of those who have go astray in the balance against the benefit we have have by be again put in breath and by have our zeal and strength revive by reason of this opposition i know not whether the utility would not surmount the damage we have think to tie the nuptial knot of our marriage more fast and firm by have take away all mean of dissolve it but the knot of the will and affection be so much the more slackened and make loose by how much that of constraint be draw closer and on the contrary that which keep the marriage at rome so long in honour and inviolate be the liberty every one who so desire have to break them they keep their wife the good because they might part with them if they would and in the full liberty of divorce five hundred year and more pass away before any one make use ont we might here introduce the opinion of an ancient upon this occasion that execution rather whet than dull the edge of vice that they do not beget the care of do well that be the work of reason and discipline but only a care not to be take in do ill i do not know that this be true but i experimentally know that never civil government be by that mean reform the order and regimen of manner depend upon some other expedient the greek history make mention of the argippians neighbour to scythia who live without either rod or stick for offence where not only no one attempt to attack them but whoever can fly thither be safe by reason of their virtue and sanctity of life and no one be so bold a to lay hand upon them and they have application make to them to determine the controversy that arise betwixt men of other country there be a certain nation where the enclosure of garden and field they would preserve be make only of a string of cotton and so fenced be more firm and secure than by our hedge and ditch peradventure the facility of enter my house amongst other thing have be a mean to preserve it from the violence of our civil war defence allure attempt and defiance provokes an enemy i enervate the soldier design by deprive the exploit of danger and all manner of military glory which be wont to serve them for pretence and excuse whatever be bravely be ever honourably do at a time when justice be dead i render them the conquest of my house cowardly and base it be never shut to any one that knock my gate have no other guard than a porter and he of ancient custom and ceremony who do not so much serve to defend it a to offer it with more decorum and grace i have no other guard nor sentinel than the star a gentleman would play the fool to make a show of defence if he be not really in a condition to defend himself he who lie open on one side be everywhere so our ancestor do not think of build frontier garrison the mean of assault i mean without battery or army and of surprising our house increase every day more and more beyond the mean to guard them mens wit be generally bent that way in invasion every one be concern none but the rich in defence mine be strong for the time when it be build i have add nothing to it of that kind and should fear that it strength might turn against myself to which we be to consider that a peaceable time would require it should be dismantle there be danger never to be able to regain it and it would be very hard to keep for in intestine dissension your man may be of the party you fear and where religion be the pretext even a man near relation become unreliable with some colour of justice the public exchequer will not maintain our domestic garrison they would exhaust it we ourselves have not the mean to do it without ruin or which be more inconvenient and injurious without ruin the people the condition of my loss would be scarcely bad a to the rest you there lose all and even your friend will be more ready to accuse your want of vigilance and your improvidence and your ignorance of and indifference to your own business than to pity you that so many garrison house have be undone whereas this of mine remain make me apt to believe that they be only lose by be guard this give an enemy both an invitation and colour of reason all defence show a face of war let who will come to me in god name but i shall not invite them tis the retirement i have choose for my repose from war i endeavour to withdraw this corner from the public tempest a i also do another corner in my soul our war may put on what form it will multiply and diversify itself into new party for my part i stir not amongst so many garrisoned house myself alone amongst those of my rank so far a i know in france have trust purely to heaven for the protection of mine and have never remove plate deed or hanging i will neither fear nor save myself by half if a full acknowledgment acquire the divine favour it will stay with me to the end if not i have still continue long enough to render my continuance remarkable and fit to be record how why there be thirty year that i have thus live there be the name and the thing the name be a voice which denote and signify the thing the name be no part of the thing nor of the substance tis a foreign piece join to the thing and outside it god who be all ful in himself and the height of all perfection can not augment or add anything to himself within but hi name may be augment and increase by the blessing and praise we attribute to hi exterior work which praise see we can not incorporate it in him forasmuch a he can have no accession of good we attribute to hi name which be the part out of him that be nearest to u thus be it that to god alone glory and honour appertain and there be nothing so remote from reason a that we should go in quest of it for ourselves for be indigent and necessitous within our essence be imperfect and have continual need of amelioration ti to that we ought to employ all our endeavour we be all hollow and empty ti not with wind and voice that we be to fill ourselves we want a more solid substance to repair u a man starve with hunger would be very simple to seek rather to provide himself with a gay garment than with a good meal we be to look after that whereof we have most need a we have it in our ordinary prayer we be in want of beauty health wisdom virtue and such like essential quality exterior ornament should be look after when we have make provision for necessary thing divinity treat amply and more pertinently of this subject but i be not much verse in it chrysippus and diogenes be the early and firm advocate of the contempt of glory and maintain that amongst all pleasure there be none more dangerous nor more to be avoid than that which proceed from the approbation of other and in truth experience make u sensible of many very hurtful treason in it there be nothing that so poison prince a flattery nor anything whereby wicked men more easily obtain credit and favour with them nor pander so apt and so usually make use of to corrupt the chastity of woman a to wheedle and entertain them with their own praise the first charm the syrens make use of to allure ulysses be of this nature these philosopher say that all the glory of the world be not worth an understanding man hold out hi finger to obtain it i say for it alone for it often bring several commodity along with it for which it may justly be desire it acquire u goodwill and render u less subject and expose to insult and offence from other and the like it be also one of the principal doctrine of epicurus for this precept of hi sect conceal thy life that forbid men to encumber themselves with public negotiation and office also necessarily presuppose a contempt of glory which be the worlds approbation of those action we produce in public he that bid u conceal ourselves and to have no other concern but for ourselves and who will not have u know to other would much less have u honour and glorify and so advise idomeneus not in any sort to regulate hi action by the common reputation or opinion except so a to avoid the other accidental inconvenience that the contempt of men might bring upon him these discourse be in my opinion very true and rational but we be i know not how double in ourselves which be the cause that what we believe we do not believe and can not disengage ourselves from what we condemn let u see the last and die word of epicurus they be grand and worthy of such a philosopher and yet they carry some touch of the recommendation of hi name and of that humour he have decry by hi precept here be a letter that he dictate a little before hi last gasp this be the letter and that which make me interpret that the pleasure he say he have in hi soul concern hi invention have some reference to the reputation he hop for thence after hi death be the manner of hi will in which he give order that amynomachus and timocrates hi heir should every january defray the expense of the celebration of hi birthday a hermachus should appoint and also the expense that should be make the twentieth of every moon in entertain the philosopher hi friend who should assemble in honour of the memory of him and of metrodorus carneades be head of the contrary opinion and maintain that glory be to be desire for itself even a we embrace our posthumous issue for themselves have no knowledge nor enjoyment of them this opinion have not fail to be the more universally follow a those commonly be that be most suitable to our inclination aristotle give it the first place amongst external good and avoids a too extreme vice the immoderate either seek or evade it i believe that if we have the book cicero write upon this subject we should there find pretty story for he be so possessed with this passion that if he have dare i think he could willingly have fall into the excess that other do that virtue itself be not to be covet but upon the account of the honour that always attend it which be an opinion so false that i be vexed it could ever enter into the understanding of a man that be honour with the name of philosopher if this be true men need not be virtuous but in public and we should be no further concern to keep the operation of the soul which be the true seat of virtue regular and in order than a they be to arrive at the knowledge of other is there no more in it then but only slily and with circumspection to do ill if thou knowest say carneades of a serpent lurking in a place where without suspicion a person be go to sit down by whose death thou expectest an advantage thou dost ill if thou dost not give him caution of hi danger and so much the more because the action be to be know by none but thyself if we do not take up of ourselves the rule of welldoing if impunity pas with u for justice to how many sort of wickedness shall we every day abandon ourselves i do not find what sextus peduceus do in faithfully restore the treasure that c plotius have commit to hi sole secrecy and trust a thing that i have often do myself so commendable a i should think it an execrable baseness have we do otherwise and i think it of good use in our day to recall the example of p sextilius rufus whom cicero accuse to have enter upon an inheritance contrary to hi conscience not only not against law but even by the determination of the law themselves and m crassus and hortensius who by reason of their authority and power have be call in by a stranger to share in the succession of a forge will that so he might secure hi own part satisfy themselves with have no hand in the forgery and refuse not to make their advantage and to come in for a share secure enough if they could shroud themselves from accusation witness and the cognisance of the law virtue be a very vain and frivolous thing if it derive it recommendation from glory and ti to no purpose that we endeavour to give it a station by itself and separate it from fortune for what be more accidental than reputation so to order it that action may be know and see be purely the work of fortune ti chance that help u to glory accord to it own temerity i have often see her go before merit and often very much outstrip it he who first liken glory to a shadow do good than he be aware of they be both of them thing preeminently vain glory also like a shadow go sometimes before the body and sometimes in length infinitely exceed it they who instruct gentleman only to employ their valour for the obtaining of honour what do they intend by that but to instruct them never to hazard themselves if they be not see and to observe well if there be witness present who may carry news of their valour whereas a thousand occasion of welldoing present themselves which can not be take notice of how many brave individual action be bury in the crowd of a battle whoever shall take upon him to watch anothers behaviour in such a confusion be not very busy himself and the testimony he shall give of hi companion deportment will be evidence against himself all the glory that i pretend to derive from my life be that i have live it in quiet in quiet not accord to metrodorus or arcesilaus or aristippus but accord to myself for see philosophy have not be able to find out any way to tranquillity that be good in common let every one seek it in particular to what do caesar and alexander owe the infinite grandeur of their renown but to fortune how many men have she extinguish in the beginning of their progress of whom we have no knowledge who bring as much courage to the work a they if their adverse hap have not cut them off in the first sally of their arm amongst so many and so great danger i do not remember i have anywhere read that caesar be ever wound a thousand have fall in less danger than the least of those he go through an infinite number of brave action must be perform without witness and lose before one turn to account a man be not always on the top of a breach or at the head of an army in the sight of hi general a upon a scaffold a man be often surprised betwixt the hedge and the ditch he must run the hazard of hi life against a henroost he must dislodge four rascally musketeer out of a barn he must prick out single from hi party and alone make some attempt accord a necessity will have it and whoever will observe will i believe find it experimentally true that occasion of the least lustre be ever the most dangerous and that in the war of our own time there have more brave men be lose in occasion of little moment and in the dispute about some little paltry fort than in place of great importance and where their valour might have be more honourably employ who think hi death achieve to ill purpose if he do not fall on some signal occasion instead of illustrate hi death wilfully obscure hi life suffering in the meantime many very just occasion of hazard himself to slip out of hi hand and every just one be illustrious enough every man conscience be a sufficient trumpet to him he who be only a good man that men may know it and that he may be the good esteem when ti know who will not do well but upon condition that hi virtue may be know to men be one from whom much service be not to be expect a man must go to the war upon the account of duty and expect the recompense that never fail brave and worthy action how private soever or even virtuous thoughtsthe satisfaction that a welldisposed conscience receives in itself in do well a man must be valiant for himself and upon account of the advantage it be to him to have hi courage seat in a firm and secure place against the assault of fortune it be not for outward show that the soul be to play it part but for ourselves within where no eye can pierce but our own there she defend u from the fear of death of pain of shame itself there she arm u against the loss of our child friend and fortune and when opportunity present itself she lead u on to the hazard of war this profit be of much great advantage and more worthy to be covet and hop for than honour and glory which be no other than a favourable judgment give of u a dozen men must be call out of a whole nation to judge about an acre of land and the judgment of our inclination and action the most difficult and most important matter that be we refer to the voice and determination of the rabble the mother of ignorance injustice and inconstancy be it reasonable that the life of a wise man should depend upon the judgment of fool he that make it hi business to please them will have enough to do and never have do ti a mark that can never be aim at or hit demetrius pleasantly say of the voice of the people that he make no more account of that which come from above than of that which come from below he say more no art no activity of wit could conduct our step so a to follow so wandering and so irregular a guide in this windy confusion of the noise of vulgar report and opinion that drive u on no way worth anything can be choose let u not propose to ourselves so float and waver an end let u follow constantly after reason let the public approbation follow u there if it will and a it wholly depend upon fortune we have no reason sooner to expect it by any other way than that even though i would not follow the right way because it be right i should however follow it a have experimentally find that at the end of the reckon ti commonly the most happy and of great utility the mariner of old say thus to neptune in a great tempest o god thou wilt save me if thou wilt and if thou choosest thou wilt destroy me but however i will hold my rudder straight i have see in my time a thousand men supple halfbred ambiguous whom no one doubt to be more worldlywise than i lose themselves where i have save myself paulus aemilius go on the glorious expedition of macedonia above all thing charge the people of rome not to speak of hi action during hi absence oh the license of judgment be a great disturbance to great affair forasmuch a every one have not the firmness of fabius against common adverse and injurious tongue who rather suffer hi authority to be dissect by the vain fancy of men than to do less well in hi charge with a favourable reputation and the popular applause there be i know not what natural sweetness in hear one self commend but we be a great deal too fond of it i care not so much what i be in the opinion of other a what i be in my own i would be rich of myself and not by borrow stranger see nothing but event and outward appearance everybody can set a good face on the matter when they have tremble and terror within they do not see my heart they see but my countenance one be right in decry the hypocrisy that be in war for what be more easy to an old soldier than to shift in a time of danger and to counterfeit the brave when he have no more heart than a chicken there be so many way to avoid hazard a man own person that we have deceive the world a thousand time before we come to be engage in a real danger and even then find ourselves in an inevitable necessity of do something we can make shift for that time to conceal our apprehension by set a good face on the business though the heart beat within and whoever have the use of the platonic ring which render those invisible that wear it if turn inward towards the palm of the hand a great many would very often hide themselves when they ought most to appear and would repent be place in so honourable a post where necessity must make them bold thus we see how all the judgment that be found upon external appearance be marvellously uncertain and doubtful and that there be no so certain testimony a every one be to himself in these how many soldier boy be companion of our glory he who stand firm in an open trench what do he in that more than fifty poor pioneer who open to him the way and cover it with their own body for fivepence a day pay do before him the dispersing and scatter our name into many mouth we call make them more great we will have them there well receive and that this increase turn to their advantage which be all that can be excusable in this design but the excess of this disease proceeds so far that many covet to have a name be it what it will trogus pompeius say of herostratus and titus livius of manlius capitolinus that they be more ambitious of a great reputation than of a good one this be very common we be more solicitous that men speak of u than how they speak and it be enough for u that our name be often mention be it after what manner it will it should seem that to be know be in some sort to have a man life and it duration in other keep i for my part hold that i be not but in myself and of that other life of mine which lie in the knowledge of my friend to consider it naked and simply in itself i know very well that i be sensible of no fruit nor enjoyment from it but by the vanity of a fantastic opinion and when i shall be dead i shall be still and much less sensible of it and shall withal absolutely lose the use of those real advantage that sometimes accidentally follow it i shall have no more handle whereby to take hold of reputation neither shall it have any whereby to take hold of or to cleave to me for to expect that my name should be advance by it in the first place i have no name that be enough my own of two that i have one be common to all my race and indeed to other also there be two family at paris and montpellier whose surname be montaigne another in brittany and one in xaintonge de la montaigne the transposition of one syllable only would suffice so to ravel our affair that i shall share in their glory and they peradventure will partake of my discredit and moreover my ancestor have formerly be surnamed eyquem a name wherein a family well know in england be at this day concern a to my other name every one may take it that will and so perhaps i may honour a porter in my own stead and besides though i have a particular distinction by myself what can it distinguish when i be no more can it point out and favour inanity but of this i have speak elsewhere a to what remain in a great battle where ten thousand men be maim or kill there be not fifteen who be take notice of it must be some very eminent greatness or some consequence of great importance that fortune have add to it that signalise a private action not of a harquebus only but of a great captain for to kill a man or two or ten to expose a man self bravely to the utmost peril of death be indeed something in every one of u because we there hazard all but for the world concern they be thing so ordinary and so many of them be every day see and there must of necessity be so many of the same kind to produce any notable effect that we can not expect any particular renown from it of so many thousand of valiant men who have die within these fifteen hundred year in france with their sword in their hand not a hundred have come to our knowledge the memory not of the commander only but of battle and victory be bury and go the fortune of above half of the world for want of a record stir not from their place and vanish without duration if i have unknown event in my possession i should think with great ease to outdo those that be record in all sort of example be it not strange that even of the greek and roman with so many writer and witness and so many rare and noble exploit so few be arrive at our knowledge it will be much if a hundred year hence it be remember in general that in our time there be civil war in france the lacedaemonians enter into battle sacrifice to the mus to the end that their action might be well and worthily write look upon it a a divine and no common favour that brave act should find witness that could give them life and memory do we expect that at every musketshot we receive and at every hazard we run there must be a register ready to record it and besides a hundred register may enrol them whose commentary will not last above three day and will never come to the sight of any one we have not the thousandth part of ancient writing ti fortune that give them a shorter or long life accord to her favour and ti permissible to doubt whether those we have be not the bad not have see the rest men do not write history of thing of so little moment a man must have be general in the conquest of an empire or a kingdom he must have win twoandfifty set battle and always the weaker in number a caesar do ten thousand brave fellow and many great captain lose their life valiantly in hi service whose name last no long than their wife and child live even those whom we see behave themselves well three month or three year after they have depart hence be no more mentioned than if they have never be whoever will justly consider and with due proportion of what kind of men and of what sort of action the glory sustain itself in the record of history will find that there be very few action and very few person of our time who can there pretend any right how many worthy men have we know to survive their own reputation who have see and suffer the honour and glory most justly acquire in their youth extinguish in their own presence and for three year of this fantastic and imaginary life we must go and throw away our true and essential life and engage ourselves in a perpetual death the sage propose to themselves a nobler and more just end in so important an enterprise it be peradventure excusable in a painter or other artisan or in a rhetorician or a grammarian to endeavour to raise himself a name by hi work but the action of virtue be too noble in themselves to seek any other reward than from their own value and especially to seek it in the vanity of human judgment if this false opinion nevertheless be of such use to the public a to keep men in their duty if the people be thereby stir up to virtue if prince be touch to see the world bless the memory of trajan and abominate that of nero if it move them to see the name of that great beast once so terrible and fear so freely cursed and revile by every schoolboy let it by all mean increase and be as much a possible nurse up and cherish amongst u and plato bend hi whole endeavour to make hi citizen virtuous also advise them not to despise the good repute and esteem of the people and say it fall out by a certain divine inspiration that even the wicked themselves ofttimes as well by word a opinion can rightly distinguish the virtuous from the wicked this person and hi tutor be both marvellous and bold artificer everywhere to add divine operation and revelation where human force be want and peradventure for this reason it be that timon rail at him call him the great forger of miracle see that men by their insufficiency can not pay themselves well enough with current money let the counterfeit be superadded ti a way that have be practise by all the legislator and there be no government that have not some mixture either of ceremonial vanity or of false opinion that serve for a curb to keep the people in their duty ti for this that most of them have their original and beginning fabulous and enrich with supernatural mystery tis this that have give credit to bastard religion and cause them to be countenance by men of understanding and for this that numa and sertorius to possess their men with a good opinion of them feed them with this foppery one that the nymph egeria the other that hi white hind bring them all their counsel from the god and the authority that numa give to hi law under the title of the patronage of this goddess zoroaster legislator of the bactrians and persian give to hi under the name of the god oromazis trismegistus legislator of the egyptian under that of mercury xamolxis legislator of the scythian under that of vesta charondas legislator of the chalcidians under that of saturn minos legislator of the candiots under that of jupiter lycurgus legislator of the lacedaemonians under that of apollo and draco and solon legislator of the athenian under that of minerva and every government have a god at the head of it the other falsely that truly which moses set over the jew at their departure out of egypt the religion of the bedouin a the sire de joinville report amongst other thing enjoin a belief that the soul of him amongst them who die for hi prince go into another body more happy more beautiful and more robust than the former by which mean they much more willingly venture their life this be a very comfortable belief however erroneous every nation have many such example of it own but this subject would require a treatise by itself to add one word more to my former discourse i would advise the lady no longer to call that honour which be but their duty their duty be the mark their honour but the outward rind neither would i advise them to give this excuse for payment of their denial for i presuppose that their intention their desire and will which be thing wherein their honour be not at all concerned forasmuch a nothing thereof appear without be much well regulate than the effect the offence both towards god and in the conscience would be as great to desire a to do it and besides they be action so private and secret of themselves a would be easily enough keep from the knowledge of other wherein the honour consist if they have not another respect to their duty and the affection they bear to chastity for itself every woman of honour will much rather choose to lose her honour than to hurt her conscience there be another sort of glory which be the have too good an opinion of our own worth ti an inconsiderate affection with which we flatter ourselves and that represent u to ourselves other than we truly be like the passion of love that lend beauty and grace to the object and make those who be catch by it with a depraved and corrupt judgment consider the thing which they love other and more perfect than it be i would not nevertheless for fear of fail on this side that a man should not know himself aright or think himself less than he be the judgment ought in all thing to maintain it right ti all the reason in the world he should discern in himself as well a in other what truth set before him if it be caesar let him boldly think himself the great captain in the world we be nothing but ceremony ceremony carry u away and we leave the substance of thing we hold by the branch and quit the trunk and the body we have teach the lady to blush when they hear that but name which they be not at all afraid to do we dare not call our member by their right name yet be not afraid to employ them in all sort of debauchery ceremony forbids u to express by word thing that be lawful and natural and we obey it reason forbids u to do thing unlawful and ill and nobody obeys it i find myself here fetter by the law of ceremony for it neither permit a man to speak well of himself nor ill we will leave her there for this time they whom fortune call it good or ill have make to pass their life in some eminent degree may by their public action manifest what they be but they whom she have only employ in the crowd and of whom nobody will say a word unless they speak themselves be to be excuse if they take the boldness to speak of themselves to such a be interested to know them by the example of lucilius he always commit to paper hi action and thought and there portray himself such a he find himself to be i remember then that from my infancy there be observe in me i know not what kind of carriage and behaviour that seem to relish of pride and arrogance i will say this by the way that it be not unreasonable to suppose that we have quality and inclination so much our own and so incorporate in u that we have not the mean to feel and recognise them and of such natural inclination the body will retain a certain bent without our knowledge or consent it be an affectation conformable with hi beauty that make alexander carry hi head on one side and cause alcibiades to lisp julius caesar scratch hi head with one finger which be the fashion of a man full of troublesome thought and cicero a i remember be wont to pucker up hi nose a sign of a man give to scoff such motion a these may imperceptibly happen in u there be other artificial one which i meddle not with a salutation and congee by which men acquire for the most part unjustly the reputation of be humble and courteous one may be humble out of pride i be prodigal enough of my hat especially in summer and never be so saluted but that i pay it again from person of what quality soever unless they be in my own service i should make it my request to some prince whom i know that they would be more sparing of that ceremony and bestow that courtesy where it be more due for be so indiscreetly and indifferently confer on all it be throw away to no purpose if it be without respect of person it lose it effect amongst irregular deportment let u not forget that haughty one of the emperor constantius who always in public hold hi head upright and stiff without bend or turn on either side not so much a to look upon those who salute him on one side plant hi body in a rigid immovable posture without suffer it to yield to the motion of hi coach not dare so much a to spit blow hi nose or wipe hi face before people i know not whether the gesture that be observe in me be of this first quality and whether i have really any occult proneness to this vice a it might well be and i can not be responsible for the motion of the body but a to the motion of the soul i must here confess what i think of the matter this glory consist of two part the one in set too great a value upon ourselves and the other in set too little a value upon other a to the one methinks these consideration ought in the first place to be of some force i feel myself importune by an error of the soul that displease me both a it be unjust and still more a it be troublesome i attempt to correct it but i can not root it out and this be that i lessen the just value of thing that i possess and overvalue thing because they be foreign absent and none of mine this humour spread very far a the prerogative of the authority make husband look upon their own wife with a vicious disdain and many father their child so i betwixt two equal merit should always be sway against my own not so much that the jealousy of my advancement and bettering trouble my judgment and hinders me from satisfy myself a that of itself possession beget a contempt of what it hold and rule foreign government manner and language insinuate themselves into my esteem and i be sensible that latin allure me by the favour of it dignity to value it above it due a it do with child and the common sort of people the domestic government house horse of my neighbour though no good than my own i prize above my own because they be not mine besides that i be very ignorant in my own affair i be strike by the assurance that every one have of himself whereas there be scarcely anything that i be sure i know or that i dare be responsible to myself that i can do i have not my mean of do anything in condition and ready and be only instructed therein after the effect a doubtful of my own force a i be of anothers whence it come to pass that if i happen to do anything commendable i attribute it more to my fortune than industry forasmuch a i design everything by chance and in fear i have this also in general that of all the opinion antiquity have hold of men in gross i most willingly embrace and adhere to those that most contemn and undervalue u and most push u to naught methinks philosophy have never so fair a game to play a when it fall upon our vanity and presumption when it most lays open our irresolution weakness and ignorance i look upon the too good opinion that man have of himself to be the nursing mother of all the most false opinion both public and private those people who ride astride upon the epicycle of mercury who see so far into the heaven be bad to me than a toothdrawer that come to draw my teeth for in my study the subject of which be man find so great a variety of judgment so profound a labyrinth of difficulty one upon another so great diversityand uncertainty even in the school of wisdom itself you may judge see these people could not resolve upon the knowledge of themselves and their own condition which be continually before their eye and within them see they do not know how that move which they themselves move nor how to give u a description of the spring they themselves govern and make use of how can i believe them about the ebbing and flowing of the nile the curiosity of know thing have be give to man for a scourge say the holy scripture but to return to what concern myself i think it would be very difficult for any other man to have a mean opinion of himself nay for any other to have a mean opinion of me than of myself i look upon myself a one of the common sort save in this that i have no good an opinion of myself guilty of the mean and most popular defect but not disown or excuse them and i do not value myself upon any other account than because i know my own value if there be any vanity in the case ti superficially infuse into me by the treachery of my complexion and have no body that my judgment can discern i be sprinkle but not dye for in truth a to the effect of the mind there be no part of me be it what it will with which i be satisfied and the approbation of other make me not think the good of myself my judgment be tender and nice especially in thing that concern myself i ever repudiate myself and feel myself float and waver by reason of my weakness i have nothing of my own that satisfies my judgment my sight be clear and regular enough but at work it be apt to dazzle a i most manifestly find in poetry i love it infinitely and be able to give a tolerable judgment of other men work but in good earnest when i apply myself to it i play the child and be not able to endure myself a man may play the fool in everything els but not in poetry i would to god this sentence be write over the door of all our printer to forbid the entrance of so many rhymester why have not we such people dionysius the father value himself upon nothing so much a hi poetry at the olympic game with chariot surpass all the other in magnificence he send also poet and musician to present hi verse with tent and pavilion royally gilt and hung with tapestry when hi verse come to be recite the excellence of the delivery at first attract the attention of the people but when they afterwards come to poise the meanness of the composition they first enter into disdain and continue to nettle their judgment presently proceed to fury and run to pull down and tear to piece all hi pavilion and that hi chariot neither perform anything to purpose in the race and that the ship which bring back hi people fail of make sicily and be by the tempest driven and wreck upon the coast of tarentum they certainly believe be through the anger of the god incense a they themselves be against the paltry poem and even the mariner who escape from the wreck second this opinion of the people to which also the oracle that foretell hi death seem to subscribe which be that dionysius should be near hi end when he should have overcome those who be good than himself which he interpret of the carthaginian who surpass him in power and have war with them often decline the victory not to incur the sense of this prediction but he understand it ill for the god indicate the time of the advantage that by favour and injustice he obtain at athens over the tragic poet well than himself have cause hi own play call the leneians to be act in emulation presently after which victory he die and partly of the excessive joy he conceive at the success what i find tolerable of mine be not so really and in itself but in comparison of other bad thing that i see well enough receive i envy the happiness of those who can please and hug themselves in what they do for ti an easy thing to be so pleased because a man extract that pleasure from himself especially if he be constant in hi selfconceit i know a poet against whom the intelligent and the ignorant abroad and at home both heaven and earth exclaim that he have but very little notion of it and yet for all that he have never a whit the bad opinion of himself but be always fall upon some new piece always contrive some new invention and still persists in hi opinion by so much the more obstinately a it only concern him to maintain it my work be so far from please me that as often a i review them they disgust me i have always an idea in my soul and a sort of disturbed image which present me a in a dream with a good form than that i have make use of but i can not catch it nor fit it to my purpose and even that idea be but of the meaner sort hence i conclude that the production of those great and rich soul of former time be very much beyond the utmost stretch of my imagination or my wish their writing do not only satisfy and fill me but they astound me and ravish me with admiration i judge of their beauty i see it if not to the utmost yet so far at least a ti possible for me to aspire whatever i undertake i owe a sacrifice to the grace a plutarch say of some one to conciliate their favour they abandon me throughout all i write be rude polish and beauty be want i can not set thing off to any advantage my handle add nothing to the matter for which reason i must have it forcible very full and that have lustre of it own if i pitch upon subject that be popular and gay ti to follow my own inclination who do not affect a grave and ceremonious wisdom a the world do and to make myself more sprightly but not my style more wanton which would rather have them grave and severe at least if i may call that a style which be an inform and irregular way of speak a popular jargon a proceeding without definition division conclusion perplex like that amafanius and rabirius i can neither please nor delight nor even tickle my reader the best story in the world be spoil by my handling and become flat i can not speak but in rough earnest and be totally unprovided of that facility which i observe in many of my acquaintance of entertain the first comer and keep a whole company in breath or take up the ear of a prince with all sort of discourse without weary themselves they never want matter by reason of the faculty and grace they have in take hold of the first thing that start up and accommodate it to the humour and capacity of those with whom they have to do prince do not much affect solid discourse nor i to tell story the first and easy reason which be commonly the best take i know not how to employ i be an ill orator to the common sort i be apt of everything to say the extreme that i know cicero be of opinion that in treatise of philosophy the exordium be the hard part if this be true i be wise in stick to the conclusion and yet we be to know how to wind the string to all note and the sharpest be that which be the most seldom touch there be at least as much perfection in elevate an empty a in support a weighty thing a man must sometimes superficially handle thing and sometimes push them home i know very well that most men keep themselves in this low form from not conceive thing otherwise than by this outward bark but i likewise know that the great master and xenophon and plato be often see to stoop to this low and popular manner of speaking and treating of thing but support it with grace which never fail them farther my language have nothing in it that be facile and polished ti rough free and irregular and a such plea if not my judgment at all event my inclination but i very well perceive that i sometimes give myself too much rein and that by endeavour to avoid art and affectation i fall into the other inconvenience plato say that the long or the short be not property that either take away or give value to language should i attempt to follow the other more moderate united and regular style i should never attain to it and though the short round period of sallust best suit with my humour yet i find caesar much grander and harder to imitate and though my inclination would rather prompt me to imitate seneca way of write yet i do nevertheless more esteem that of plutarch both in do and speak i simply follow my own natural way whence peradventure it fall out that i be well at speak than write motion and action animate word especially in those who lay about them briskly a i do and grow hot the comportment the countenance the voice the robe the place will set off some thing that of themselves would appear no good than prate messalla complains in tacitus of the strait of some garment in hi time and of the fashion of the bench where the orator be to declaim that be a disadvantage to their eloquence my french tongue be corrupt both in the pronunciation and otherwise by the barbarism of my country i never saw a man who be a native of any of the province on this side of the kingdom who have not a twang of hi place of birth and that be not offensive to ear that be purely french and yet it be not that i be so perfect in my perigordin for i can no more speak it than high dutch nor do i much care ti a language a the rest about me on every side of poitou xaintonge angoumousin limousin auvergne a poor drawling scurvy language there be indeed above u towards the mountain a sort of gascon speak that i be mightily take with blunt brief significant and in truth a more manly and military language than any other i be acquaint with a sinewy powerful and pertinent a the french be graceful neat and luxuriant a to the latin which be give me for my mother tongue i have by discontinuance lose the use of speak it and indeed of write it too wherein i formerly have a particular reputation by which you may see how inconsiderable i be on that side beauty be a thing of great recommendation in the correspondence amongst men tis the first mean of acquire the favour and good liking of one another and no man be so barbarous and morose a not to perceive himself in some sort strike with it attraction the body have a great share in our be have an eminent place there and therefore it structure and composition be of very just consideration they who go about to disunite and separate our two principal part from one another be to blame we must on the contrary reunite and rejoin them we must command the soul not to withdraw and entertain itself apart not to despise and abandon the body neither can she do it but by some apish counterfeit but to unite herself close to it to embrace cherish assist govern and advise it and to bring it back and set it into the true way when it wander in sum to espouse and be a husband to it so that their effect may not appear to be diverse and contrary but uniform and concur christian have a particular instruction concern this connection for they know that the divine justice embrace this society and juncture of body and soul even to the make the body capable of eternal reward and that god have an eye to the whole man way and will that he receive entire chastisement or reward accord to hi demerit or merit the sect of the peripatetic of all sects the most sociable attribute to wisdom this sole care equally to provide for the good of these two associate part and the other sect in not sufficiently apply themselves to the consideration of this mixture show themselves to be divide one for the body and the other for the soul with equal error and to have lose sight of their subject which be man and their guide which they generally confess to be nature the first distinction that ever be amongst men and the first consideration that give some preeminence over other tis likely be the advantage of beauty now i be of something low than the middle stature a defect that not only border upon deformity but carry withal a great deal of inconvenience along with it especially for those who be in office and command for the authority which a graceful presence and a majestic mien beget be want c marius do not willingly enlist any soldier who be not six foot high the courtier have indeed reason to desire a moderate stature in the gentleman he be set forth rather than any other and to reject all strangeness that should make him be point at but if i be to choose whether this medium must be rather below than above the common standard i would not have it so in a soldier little men say aristotle be pretty but not handsome and greatness of soul be discover in a great body a beauty be in a conspicuous stature the ethiopian and indian say he in choose their king and magistrate have regard to the beauty and stature of their person they have reason for it create respect in those who follow them and be a terror to the enemy to see a leader of a brave and goodly stature march at the head of a battalion our holy and heavenly king of whom every circumstance be most carefully and with the great religion and reverence to be observe have not himself reject bodily recommendation and plato together with temperance and fortitude require beauty in the conservator of hi republic it would vex you that a man should apply himself to you amongst your servant to inquire where monsieur be and that you should only have the remainder of the compliment of the hat that be make to your barber or your secretary a it happen to poor philopoemen who arrive the first of all hi company at an inn where he be expect the hostess who know him not and saw him an unsightly fellow employ him to go help her maid a little to draw water and make a fire against philopoemens come the gentleman of hi train arrive presently after and surprise to see him busy in this fine employment for he fail not to obey hi landlady command ask him what he be do there i be say he pay the penalty of my ugliness the other beauty belong to woman the beauty of stature be the only beauty of men where there be a contemptible stature neither the largeness and roundness of the forehead nor the whiteness and sweetness of the eye nor the moderate proportion of the nose nor the littleness of the ear and mouth nor the evenness and whiteness of the teeth nor the thickness of a wellset brown beard shin like the husk of a chestnut nor curled hair nor the just proportion of the head nor a fresh complexion nor a please air of a face nor a body without any offensive scent nor the just proportion of limb can make a handsome man i be a to the rest strong and well knit my face be not puff but full and my complexion betwixt jovial and melancholic moderately sanguine and hot my health vigorous and sprightly even to a well advanced age and rarely troubled with sickness such i be for i do not now make any account of myself now that i be engage in the avenue of old age be already past forty what shall be from this time forward will be but a halfbeing and no more me i every day escape and steal away from myself agility and address i never have and yet be the son of a very active and sprightly father who continue to be so to an extreme old age i have scarce know any man of hi condition hi equal in all bodily exercise a i have seldom meet with any who have not excel me except in run at which i be pretty good in music or singing for which i have a very unfit voice or to play on any sort of instrument they could never teach me anything in dance tennis or wrestling i could never arrive to more than an ordinary pitch in swim fence vaulting and leap to none at all my hand be so clumsy that i can not even write so a to read it myself so that i have rather do what i have scribble over again than take upon me the trouble to make it out i do not read much good than i write and feel that i weary my auditor otherwise i be not a bad clerk i can not decently fold up a letter nor could ever make a pen or carve at table worth a pin nor saddle a horse nor carry a hawk and fly her nor hunt the dog nor lure a hawk nor speak to a horse in fine my bodily quality be very well suit to those of my soul there be nothing sprightly only a full and firm vigour i be patient enough of labour and pain but it be only when i go voluntary to work and only so long a my own desire prompt me to it otherwise if i be not allure with some pleasure or have other guide than my own pure and free inclination i be good for nothing for i be of a humour that life and health except there be nothing for which i will bite my nail and that i will purchase at the price of torment of mind and constraint extremely idle extremely give up to my own inclination both by nature and art i would as willingly lend a man my blood a my pain i have a soul free and entirely it own and accustom to guide itself after it own fashion have hitherto never have either master or governor impose upon me i have walk as far a i would and at the pace that best please myself this be it that have render me unfit for the service of other and have make me of no use to any one but myself nor be there any need of force my heavy and lazy disposition for be bear to such a fortune a i have reason to be content with a reason nevertheless that a thousand other of my acquaintance would have rather make use of for a plank upon which to pass over in search of high fortune to tumult and disquiet and with as much intelligence a i require i seek for no more and also get no more i have only need of what be sufficient to content me which nevertheless be a government of soul to take it right equally difficult in all sort of condition and that of custom we see more easily find in want than in abundance forasmuch peradventure a accord to the course of our other passion the desire of rich be more sharpen by their use than by the need of them and the virtue of moderation more rare than that of patience and i never have anything to desire but happily to enjoy the estate that god by hi bounty have put into my hand i have never know anything of trouble and have have little to do in anything but the management of my own affair or if i have it have be upon condition to do it at my own leisure and after my own method commit to my trust by such a have a confidence in me who do not importune me and who know my humour for good horseman will make shift to get service out of a rusty and brokenwinded jade even my infancy be train up after a gentle and free manner and exempt from any rigorous subjection all this have help me to a complexion delicate and incapable of solicitude even to that degree that i love to have my loss and the disorder wherein i be concern conceal from me in the account of my expense i put down what my negligence cost me in feed and maintain it i love not to know what i have that i may be less sensible of my loss i entreat those who serve me where affection and integrity be absent to deceive me with something like a decent appearance for want of constancy enough to support the shock of adverse accident to which we be subject and of patience seriously to apply myself to the management of my affair i nourish as much a i can this in myself wholly leave all to fortune to take all thing at the bad and to resolve to bear that bad with temper and patience that be the only thing i aim at and to which i apply my whole meditation in a danger i do not so much consider how i shall escape it a of how little importance it be whether i escape it or no should i be leave dead upon the place what matter not be able to govern event i govern myself and apply myself to them if they will not apply themselves to me i have no great art to evade escape from or force fortune and by prudence to guide and incline thing to my own bias i have still less patience to undergo the troublesome and painful care therein require and the most uneasy condition for me be to be suspend on urgent occasion and to be agitate betwixt hope and fear deliberation even in thing of light moment be very troublesome to me and i find my mind more put to it to undergo the various tumbling and tossings of doubt and consultation than to set up it rest and to acquiesce in whatever shall happen after the die be throw few passion break my sleep but of deliberation the least will do it a in road i preferably avoid those that be slop and slippery and put myself into the beaten track how dirty or deep soever where i can fall no low and there seek my safety so i love misfortune that be purely so that do not torment and tease me with the uncertainty of their grow well but that at the first push plunge me directly into the bad that can be expect in event i carry myself like a man in conduct like a child the fear of the fall more fever me than the fall itself the game be not worth the candle the covetous man fare bad with hi passion than the poor and the jealous man than the cuckold and a man ofttimes lose more by defend hi vineyard than if he give it up the low walk be the safe ti the seat of constancy you have there need of no one but yourself tis there found and wholly stand upon it own basis ha not this example of a gentleman very well know some air of philosophy in it he marry be well advance in year have spend hi youth in good fellowship a great talker and a great jeerer call to mind how much the subject of cuckoldry have give him occasion to talk and scoff at other to prevent them from pay him in hi own coin he marry a wife from a place where any one find what he want for hi money good morrow strumpet good morrow cuckold and there be not anything wherewith he more commonly and openly entertain those who come to see him than with this design of hi by which he stop the private chattering of mocker and blunt all the point from this reproach a to ambition which be neighbour or rather daughter to presumption fortune to advance me must have come and take me by the hand for to trouble myself for an uncertain hope and to have submit myself to all the difficulty that accompany those who endeavour to bring themselves into credit in the beginning of their progress i could never have do it i apply myself to what i see and to what i have in my hand and go not very far from the shore and besides a man rarely arrive at these advancement but in first hazard what he have of hi own and i be of opinion that if a man have sufficient to maintain him in the condition wherein he be bear and bring up ti a great folly to hazard that upon the uncertainty of augment it he to whom fortune have deny whereon to set hi foot and to settle a quiet and composed way of living be to be excuse if he venture what he have because happen what will necessity put him upon shift for himself and i rather excuse a young brother for expose what hi friend have leave him to the courtesy of fortune than him with whom the honour of hi family be entrust who can not be necessitous but by hi own fault i have find a much short and more easy way by the advice of the good friend i have in my young day to free myself from any such ambition and to sit still judge rightly enough of my own strength that it be not capable of any great matter and call to mind the saying of the late chancellor olivier that the french be like monkey that swarm up a tree from branch to branch and never stop till they come to the high and there shew their breech i should find the best quality i have useless in this age the facility of my manner would have be call weakness and negligence my faith and conscience scrupulosity and superstition my liberty and freedom would have be repute troublesome inconsiderate and rash ill luck be good for something it be good to be bear in a very depraved age for so in comparison of other you shall be repute virtuous good cheap he who in our day be but a parricide and a sacrilegious person be an honest man and a man of honour and never be time or place wherein prince might propose to themselves more assured or great reward for virtue and justice the first who shall make it hi business to get himself into favour and esteem by those way i be much deceive if he do not and by the best title outstrip hi competitor force and violence can do something but not always all we see merchant country justice and artisan go cheek by jowl with the best gentry in valour and military knowledge they perform honourable action both in public engagement and private quarrel they fight duel they defend town in our present war a prince stifle hi special recommendation renown in this crowd let him shine bright in humanity truth loyalty temperance and especially injustice mark rare unknown and exile ti by no other mean but by the sole goodwill of the people that he can do hi business and no other quality can attract their goodwill like those a be of the great utility to them by this standard i have be great and rare just a i find myself now pigmy and vulgar by the standard of some past age wherein if no other good quality concur it be ordinary and common to see a man moderate in hi revenge gentle in resent injury religious of hi word neither double nor supple nor accommodate hi faith to the will of other or the turn of the time i would rather see all affair go to wreck and ruin than falsify my faith to secure them for as to this new virtue of feigning and dissimulation which be now in so great credit i mortally hate it and of all vice find none that evidence so much baseness and meanness of spirit ti a cowardly and servile humour to hide and disguise a man self under a visor and not to dare to show himself what he be tis by this our servant be train up to treachery be bring up to speak what be not true they make no conscience of a lie a generous heart ought not to belie it own thought it will make itself see within all there be good or at least human aristotle repute it the office of magnanimity openly and professedly to love and hate to judge and speak with all freedom and not to value the approbation or dislike of other in comparison of truth apollonius say it be for slave to lie and for freeman to speak truth ti the chief and fundamental part of virtue we must love it for itself he who speak truth because he be oblige so to do and because it serve him and who be not afraid to lie when it signify nothing to anybody be not sufficiently true my soul naturally abominate lie and hat the very thought of it i have an inward shame and a sharp remorse if sometimes a lie escape me a sometimes it do be surprise by occasion that allow me no premeditation a man must not always tell all for that be folly but what a man say should be what he think otherwise tis knavery i do not know what advantage men pretend to by eternally counterfeit and dissemble if not never to be believe when they speak the truth it may once or twice pas with men but to profess the conceal their thought and to brag a some of our prince have do that they would burn their shirt if they know their true intention which be a saying of the ancient metellius of macedon and that they who know not how to dissemble know not how to rule be to give warning to all who have anything to do with them that all they say be nothing but lying and deceit it be a great simplicity in any one to lay any stress either on the countenance or word of a man who have put on a resolution to be always another thing without than he be within a tiberius do and i can not conceive what part such person can have in conversation with men see they produce nothing that be receive a true whoever be disloyal to truth be the same to falsehood also those of our time who have consider in the establishment of the duty of a prince the good of hi affair only and have prefer that to the care of hi faith and conscience might have something to say to a prince whose affair fortune have put into such a posture that he might for ever establish them by only once break hi word but it will not go so they often buy in the same market they make more than one peace and enter into more than one treaty in their life gain tempts to the first breach of faith and almost always present itself a in all other ill act sacrileges murder rebellion treason a be undertake for some kind of advantage but this first gain have infinite mischievous consequence throw this prince out of all correspondence and negotiation by this example of infidelity soliman of the ottoman race a race not very solicitous of keep their word or compact when in my infancy he make hi army land at otranto be inform that mercurino de gratinare and the inhabitant of castro be detain prisoner after have surrender the place contrary to the article of their capitulation send order to have them set at liberty say that have other great enterprise in hand in those part the disloyalty though it carry a show of present utility would for the future bring on him a disrepute and distrust of infinite prejudice now for my part i have rather be troublesome and indiscreet than a flatterer and a dissembler i confess that there may be some mixture of pride and obstinacy in keep myself so upright and open a i do without any consideration of other and methinks i be a little too free where i ought least to be so and that i grow hot by the opposition of respect and it may be also that i suffer myself to follow the propension of my own nature for want of art use the same liberty speech and countenance towards great person that i bring with me from my own house i be sensible how much it decline towards incivility and indiscretion but besides that i be so bred i have not a wit supple enough to evade a sudden question and to escape by some evasion nor to feign a truth nor memory enough to retain it so feign nor truly assurance enough to maintain it and so play the brave out of weakness and therefore it be that i abandon myself to candour always to speak a i think both by complexion and design leave the event to fortune aristippus be wont to say that the principal benefit he have extract from philosophy be that he speak freely and openly to all memory be a faculty of wonderful use and without which the judgment can very hardly perform it office for my part i have none at all what any one will propound to me he must do it piecemeal for to answer a speech consisting of several head i be not able i could not receive a commission by word of mouth without a notebook and when i have a speech of consequence to make if it be long i be reduce to the miserable necessity of get by heart word for word what i be to say i should otherwise have neither method nor assurance be in fear that my memory would play me a slippery trick but this way be no less difficult to me than the other i must have three hour to learn three verse and besides in a work of a man own the liberty and authority of alter the order of change a word incessantly vary the matter make it hard to stick in the memory of the author the more i mistrust it the bad it be it serve me best by chance i must solicit it negligently for if i press it tis confuse and after it once begin to stagger the more i sound it the more it be perplexed it serve me at it own hour not at mine and the same defect i find in my memory i find also in several other part i fly command obligation and constraint that which i can otherwise naturally and easily do if i impose it upon myself by an express and strict injunction i can not do it even the member of my body which have a more particular jurisdiction of their own sometimes refuse to obey me if i enjoin them a necessary service at a certain hour this tyrannical and compulsive appointment baffle them they shrink up either through fear or spite and fall into a trance be once in a place where it be look upon as barbarous discourtesy not to pledge those who drink to you though i have there all liberty allow me i try to play the good fellow out of respect to the lady who be there accord to the custom of the country but there be sport enough for this pressure and preparation to force myself contrary to my custom and inclination so stop my throat that i could not swallow one drop and be deprive of drinking so much a with my meat i find myself gorge and my thirst quench by the quantity of drink that my imagination have swallow this effect be most manifest in such a have the most vehement and powerful imagination but it be natural notwithstanding and there be no one who do not in some measure feel it they offer an excellent archer condemn to die to save hi life if he would show some notable proof of hi art but he refuse to try fear l the too great contention of hi will should make him shoot wide and that instead of save hi life he should also lose the reputation he have get of be a good marksman a man who think of something els will not fail to take over and over again the same number and measure of step even to an inch in the place where he walk but if he make it hi business to measure and count them he will find that what he do by nature and accident he can not so exactly do by design my library which be a fine one among those of the village type be situate in a corner of my house if anything come into my head that i have a mind to search or to write l i should forget it in but go across the court i be fain to commit it to the memory of some other if i venture in speak to digress never so little from my subject i be infallibly lose which be the reason that i keep myself in discourse strictly close i be force to call the men who serve me either by the name of their office or their country for name be very hard for me to remember i can tell indeed that there be three syllable that it have a harsh sound and that it begin or end with such a letter but thats all and if i should live long i do not doubt but i should forget my own name a some other have do messala corvinus be two year without any trace of memory which be also say of georgius trapezuntius for my own interest i often meditate what a kind of life theirs be and if without this faculty i should have enough leave to support me with any manner of ease and pry narrowly into it i fear that this privation if absolute destroy all the other function of the soul it have befall me more than once to forget the watchword i have three hour before give or receive and to forget where i have hide my purse whatever cicero be pleased to say i help myself to lose what i have a particular care to lock safe up memory be the receptacle and case of science and therefore mine be so treacherous if i know little i can not much complain i know in general the name of the art and of what they treat but nothing more i turn over book i do not study them what i retain i no longer recognise a anothers tis only what my judgment have make it advantage of the discourse and imagination in which it have be instruct the author place word and other circumstance i immediately forget and i be so excellent at forget that i no less forget my own writing and composition than the rest i be very often quote to myself and be not aware of it whoever should inquire of me where i have the verse and examples that i have here huddle together would puzzle me to tell him and yet i have not borrow them but from famous and known author not content myself that they be rich if i moreover have them not from rich and honourable hand where there be a concurrence of authority with reason it be no great wonder if my book run the same fortune that other book do if my memory lose what i have write as well a what i have read and what i give as well a what i receive besides the defect of memory i have other which very much contribute to my ignorance i have a slow and heavy wit the least cloud stop it progress so that for example i never propose to it any never so easy a riddle that it could find out there be not the least idle subtlety that will not gravel me in game where wit be require a chess draught and the like i understand no more than the common movement i have a slow and perplexed apprehension but what it once apprehend it apprehend well for the time it retain it my sight be perfect entire and discovers at a very great distance but be soon weary and heavy at work which occasion that i can not read long but be force to have one to read to me the young pliny can inform such a have not experiment it themselves how important an impediment this be to those who devote themselves to this employment there be no so wretched and coarse a soul wherein some particular faculty be not see to shine no soul so bury in sloth and ignorance but it will sally at one end or another and how it come to pass that a man blind and asleep to everything els shall be find sprightly clear and excellent in some one particular effect we be to inquire of our master but the beautiful soul be they that be universal open and ready for all thing if not instruct at least capable of be so which i say to accuse my own for whether it be through infirmity or negligence and to neglect that which lie at our foot which we have in our hand and what near concern the use of life be far from my doctrine there be not a soul in the world so awkward a mine and so ignorant of many common thing and such a a man can not without shame fail to know i must give some example i be bear and breed up in the country and amongst husbandman i have have business and husbandry in my own hand ever since my predecessor who be lord of the estate i now enjoy leave me to succeed them and yet i can neither cast account nor reckon my counter most of our current money i do not know nor the difference betwixt one grain and another either grow or in the barn if it be not too apparent and scarcely can distinguish between the cabbage and lettuce in my garden i do not so much a understand the name of the chief instrument of husbandry nor the most ordinary element of agriculture which the very child know much less the mechanic art traffic merchandise the variety and nature of fruit wine and viand nor how to make a hawk fly nor to physic a horse or a dog and since i must publish my whole shame ti not above a month ago that i be trap in my ignorance of the use of leaven to make bread or to what end it be to keep wine in the vat they conjecture of old at athens an aptitude for the mathematics in him they saw ingeniously bavin up a burthen of brushwood in earnest they would draw a quite contrary conclusion from me for give me the whole provision and necessary of a kitchen i should starve by these feature of my confession men may imagine other to my prejudice but whatever i deliver myself to be provide it be such a i really be i have my end neither will i make any excuse for commit to paper such mean and frivolous thing a these the meanness of the subject compel me to it they may if they please accuse my project but not my progress so it be that without anybodys need to tell me i sufficiently see of how little weight and value all this be and the folly of my design ti enough that my judgment do not contradict itself of which these be the essay i be not oblige not to utter absurdity provide i be not deceive in them and know them to be such and to trip knowingly be so ordinary with me that i seldom do it otherwise and rarely trip by chance ti no great matter to add ridiculous action to the temerity of my humour since i can not ordinarily help supply it with those that be vicious i be present one day at barleduc when king francis ii for a memorial of rene king of sicily be present with a portrait he have draw of himself why be it not in like manner lawful for every one to draw himself with a pen a he do with a crayon i will not therefore omit this blemish though very unfit to be publish which be irresolution a very great effect and very incommodious in the negotiation of the affair of the world in doubtful enterprise i know not which to choose i can maintain an opinion but i can not choose one by reason that in human thing to what sect soever we incline many appearance present themselves that confirm u in it and the philosopher chrysippus say that he would of zeno and cleanthes hi master learn their doctrine only for a to proof and reason he should find enough of hi own which way soever i turn i still furnish myself with cause and likelihood enough to fix me there which make me detain doubt and the liberty of choose till occasion press and then to confess the truth i for the most part throw the feather into the wind a the saying be and commit myself to the mercy of fortune a very light inclination and circumstance carry me along with it the uncertainty of my judgment be so equally balance in most occurrence that i could willingly refer it to be decide by the chance of a die and i observe with great consideration of our human infirmity the example that the divine history itself have leave u of this custom of refer to fortune and chance the determination of election in doubtful thing human reason be a twoedged and dangerous sword observe in the hand of socrates her most intimate and familiar friend how many several point it have i be thus good for nothing but to follow and suffer myself to be easily carry away with the crowd i have not confidence enough in my own strength to take upon me to command and lead i be very glad to find the way beaten before me by other if i must run the hazard of an uncertain choice i be rather willing to have it under such a one a be more confident in hi opinion than i be in mine whose ground and foundation i find to be very slippery and unsure yet i do not easily change by reason that i discern the same weakness in contrary opinion especially in political affair there be a large field open for change and contestation machiavelli writing for example be solid enough for the subject yet be they easy enough to be controvert and they who have do so have leave a great a facility of controvert theirs there be never want in that kind of argument reply and reply upon reply and a infinite a contexture of debate a our wrangling lawyer have extend in favour of long suit the reason have little other foundation than experience and the variety of human event present u with infinite example of all sort of form an understanding person of our time say that whoever would in contradiction to our almanacs write cold where they say hot and wet where they say dry and always put the contrary to what they foretell if he be to lay a wager he would not care which side he take except where no uncertainty could fall out a to promise excessive heat at christmas or extremity of cold at midsummer i have the same opinion of these political controversy be on which side you will you have a fair a game to play a your adversary provide you do not proceed so far a to shock principle that be broad and manifest and yet in my conceit in public affair there be no government so ill provide it be ancient and have be constant that be not well than change and alteration our manner be infinitely corrupt and wonderfully incline to the worse of our law and custom there be many that be barbarous and monstrous nevertheless by reason of the difficulty of reformation and the danger of stir thing if i could put something under to stop the wheel and keep it where it be i would do it with all my heart the bad thing i find in our state be instability and that our law no more than our clothes can not settle in any certain form it be very easy to accuse a government of imperfection for all mortal thing be full of it it be very easy to beget in a people a contempt of ancient observance never any man undertook it but he do it but to establish a good regimen in the stead of that which a man have overthrow many who have attempt it have founder i very little consult my prudence in my conduct i be willing to let it be guide by the public rule happy the people who do what they be command well than they who command without torment themselves a to the cause who suffer themselves gently to roll after the celestial revolution obedience be never pure nor calm in him who reason and dispute in fine to return to myself the only thing by which i something esteem myself be that wherein never any man think himself to be defective my recommendation be vulgar common and popular for who ever think he want sense it would be a proposition that would imply a contradiction in itself tis a disease that never be where it be discern tis tenacious and strong but what the first ray of the patient sight nevertheless pierce through and disperses a the beam of the sun do thick and obscure mist to accuse one self would be to excuse in this case and to condemn to absolve there never be porter or the silly girl that do not think they have sense enough to do their business we easily enough confess in other an advantage of courage strength experience activity and beauty but an advantage in judgment we yield to none and the reason that proceed simply from the natural conclusion of other we think if we have but turn our thought that way we should ourselves have find out as well a they knowledge style and such part a we see in other work we be soon aware of if they excel our own but for the simple product of the understanding every one think he could have find out the like in himself and be hardly sensible of the weight and difficulty if not and then with much ado in an extreme and incomparable distance and whoever should be able clearly to discern the height of anothers judgment would be also able to raise hi own to the same pitch so that it be a sort of exercise from which a man be to expect very little praise a kind of composition of small repute and besides for whom do you write the learn to whom the authority appertains of judge book know no other value but that of learning and allow of no other proceeding of wit but that of erudition and art if you have mistake one of the scipio for another what be all the rest you have to say worth whoever be ignorant of aristotle accord to their rule be in some sort ignorant of himself vulgar soul can not discern the grace and force of a lofty and delicate style now these two sort of men take up the world the third sort into whose hand you fall of soul that be regular and strong of themselves be so rare that it justly have neither name nor place amongst u and tis so much time lose to aspire unto it or to endeavour to please it ti commonly say that the just portion nature have give u of her favour be that of sense for there be no one who be not content with hi share be it not reason whoever should see beyond that would see beyond hi sight i think my opinion be good and sound but who do not think the same of hi own one of the best proof i have that mine be so be the small esteem i have of myself for have they not be very well assure they would easily have suffer themselves to have be deceive by the peculiar affection i have to myself a one that place it almost wholly in myself and do not let much run out all that other distribute amongst an infinite number of friend and acquaintance to their glory and grandeur i dedicate to the repose of my own mind and to myself that which escape thence be not properly by my direction now i find my opinion very bold and constant in condemn my own imperfection and to say the truth ti a subject upon which i exercise my judgment as much a upon any other the world look always opposite i turn my sight inwards and there fix and employ it i have no other business but myself i be eternally meditate upon myself consider and taste myself other men thought be ever wander abroad if they will but see it they be still go forward for my part i circulate in myself this capacity of try the truth whatever it be in myself and this free humour of not over easily subject my belief i owe principally to myself for the strong and most general imagination i have be those that a a man may say be bear with me they be natural and entirely my own i produce them crude and simple with a strong and bold production but a little troubled and imperfect i have since establish and fortify them with the authority of other and the sound example of the ancient whom i have find of the same judgment they have give me fast hold and a more manifest fruition and possession of that i have before embrace the reputation that every one pretend to of vivacity and promptness of wit i seek in regularity the glory they pretend to from a striking and signal action or some particular excellence i claim from order correspondence and tranquillity of opinion and manner here then you see to what degree i find myself guilty of this first part that i say be the vice of presumption a to the second which consist in not have a sufficient esteem for other i know not whether or no i can so well excuse myself but whatever come ont i be resolve to speak the truth and whether peradventure it be that the continual frequent i have have with the humour of the ancient and the idea of those great soul of past age put me out of taste both with other and myself or that in truth the age we live in produce but very indifferent thing yet so it be that i see nothing worthy of any great admiration neither indeed have i so great an intimacy with many men a be requisite to make a right judgment of them and those with whom my condition make me the most frequent be for the most part men who have little care of the culture of the soul but that look upon honour a the sum of all blessing and valour a the height of all perfection what i see that be fine in other i very readily commend and esteem nay i often say more in their commendation than i think they really deserve and give myself so far leave to lie for i can not invent a false subject my testimony be never want to my friend in what i conceive deserves praise and where a foot be due i be willing to give them a foot and a half but to attribute to them quality that they have not i can not do it nor openly defend their imperfection nay i frankly give my very enemies their due testimony of honour my affection alters my judgment do not and i never confound my animosity with other circumstance that be foreign to it and i be so jealous of the liberty of my judgment that i can very hardly part with it for any passion whatever i do myself a great injury in lie than i do him of whom i tell a lie this commendable and generous custom be observe of the persian nation that they speak of their mortal enemy and with whom they be at deadly war a honourably and justly a their virtue deserve i know men enough that have several fine part one wit another courage another address another conscience another language one science another another but a generally great man and who have all these brave part together or any one of them to such a degree of excellence that we should admire him or compare him with those we honour of time past my fortune never bring me acquaint with and the great i ever know i mean for the natural part of the soul be etienne de la boetie hi be a full soul indeed and that have every way a beautiful aspect a soul of the old stamp and that have produce great effect have hi fortune be so pleased have add much to those great natural part by learn and study but how it come to pass i know not and yet it be certainly so there be as much vanity and weakness of judgment in those who profess the great ability who take upon them learn calling and bookish employment a in any other sort of men whatever either because more be require and expect from them and that common defect be excusable in them or because the opinion they have of their own learning make them more bold to expose and lay themselves too open by which they lose and betray themselves a an artificer more manifest hi want of skill in a rich matter he have in hand if he disgrace the work by ill handle and contrary to the rule require than in a matter of less value and men be more displeased at a disproportion in a statue of gold than in one of plaster so do these when they advance thing that in themselves and in their place would be good for they make use of them without discretion honour their memory at the expense of their understanding and make themselves ridiculous by honour cicero galen ulpian and st jerome alike i willingly fall again into the discourse of the vanity of our education the end of which be not to render u good and wise but learn and she have obtain it she have not teach u to follow and embrace virtue and prudence but she have imprint in u their derivation and etymology we know how to decline virtue if we know not how to love it if we do not know what prudence be really and in effect and by experience we have it however by jargon and heart we be not content to know the extraction kindred and alliance of our neighbour we desire moreover to have them our friend and to establish a correspondence and intelligence with them but this education of ours have teach u definition division and partition of virtue a so many surname and branch of a genealogy without any further care of establish any familiarity or intimacy betwixt her and u it have cull out for our initiatory instruction not such book a contain the soundest and true opinion but those that speak the best greek and latin and by their fine word have instill into our fancy the vain humour of antiquity a good education alters the judgment and manner a it happen to polemon a lewd and debauched young greek who go by chance to hear one of xenocrates lecture do not only observe the eloquence and learning of the reader and not only bring away the knowledge of some fine matter but a more manifest and more solid profit which be the sudden change and reformation of hi former life whoever find such an effect of our discipline that seem to me to be the least contemptible condition of men which by it plainness and simplicity be seat in the low degree and invite u to a more regular course i find the rude manner and language of country people commonly well suit to the rule and prescription of true philosophy than those of our philosopher themselves the most remarkable men a i have judge by outward appearance for to judge of them accord to my own method i must penetrate a great deal deeper for soldier and military conduct be the duc de guise who die at orleans and the late marshal strozzi and for men of great ability and no common virtue olivier and de lhospital chancellor of france poetry too in my opinion have flourish in this age of ours we have abundance of very good artificer in the trade daurat beza buchanan lhospital montdore turnebus a to the french poet i believe they raise their art to the high pitch to which it can ever arrive and in those part of it wherein ronsard and du bellay excel i find them little inferior to the ancient perfection adrian turnebus know more and what he do know good than any man of hi time or long before him the life of the last duke of alva and of our constable de montmorency be both of them great and noble and that have many rare resemblance of fortune but the beauty and glory of the death of the last in the sight of paris and of hi king in their service against hi near relation at the head of an army through hi conduct victorious and by a sudden stroke in so extreme old age merit methinks to be record amongst the most remarkable event of our time a also the constant goodness sweetness of manner and conscientious facility of monsieur de la noue in so great an injustice of armed party the true school of treason inhumanity and robbery wherein he always keep up the reputation of a great and experienced captain i have take a delight to publish in several place the hope i have of mari de gournay le jar my adopt daughter and certainly beloved by me more than paternally and envelop in my retirement and solitude a one of the best part of my own be i have no long regard to anything in this world but her and if a man may presage from her youth her soul will one day be capable of very great thing and amongst other of the perfection of that sacred friendship to which we do not read that any of her sex could ever yet arrive the sincerity and solidity of her manner be already sufficient for it and her affection towards me more than superabundant and such in short a that there be nothing more to be wish if not that the apprehension she have of my end be now fiveandfifty year old might not so much afflict her the judgment she make of my first essay be a woman so young and in this age and alone in her own country and the famous vehemence wherewith she love me and desire my acquaintance solely from the esteem she have thence of me before she ever saw my face be an incident very worthy of consideration other virtue have have little or no credit in this age but valour be become popular by our civil war and in this we have souls brave even to perfection and in so great number that the choice be impossible to make this be all of extraordinary and uncommon grandeur that have hitherto arrive at my knowledge well but some one will say to me this design of make a man self the subject of hi writing be indeed excusable in rare and famous men who by their reputation have give other a curiosity to be fully inform of them it be most true i confess and know very well that a mechanic will scarce lift hi eye from hi work to look at an ordinary man whereas a man will forsake hi business and hi shop to stare at an eminent person when he come into a town it misbecomes any other to give hi own character but him who have quality worthy of imitation and whose life and opinion may serve for example caesar and xenophon have a just and solid foundation whereon to find their narration the greatness of their own performance and be to be wish that we have the journal of alexander the great the commentary that augustus cato sylla brutus and other leave of their action of such person men love and contemplate the very statues even in copper and marble this remonstrance be very true but it very little concern me i do not here form a statue to erect in the great square of a city in a church or any public place ti for some corner of a library or to entertain a neighbour a kinsman a friend who have a mind to renew hi acquaintance and familiarity with me in this image of myself other have be encourage to speak of themselves because they find the subject worthy and rich i on the contrary be the bolder by reason the subject be so poor and sterile that i can not be suspect of ostentation i judge freely of the action of other i give little of my own to judge of because they be nothing i do not find so much good in myself that i can not tell it without blush what contentment would it not be to me to hear any one thus relate to me the manner face countenance the ordinary word and fortune of my ancestor how attentively should i listen to it in earnest it would be evil nature to despise so much a the picture of our friend and predecessor the fashion of their clothes and arm i preserve their writing seal and a particular sword they wear and have not throw the long stave my father use to carry in hi hand out of my closet if my posterity nevertheless shall be of another mind i shall be avenge on them for they can not care less for me than i shall then do for them all the traffic that i have in this with the public be that i borrow their utensil of write which be more easy and most at hand and in recompense shall peradventure keep a pound of butter in the market from melt in the sun and though nobody should read me have i waste time in entertain myself so many idle hour in so pleasing and useful thought in mould this figure upon myself i have be so often constrain to temper and compose myself in a right posture that the copy be truly take and have in some sort form itself paint myself for other i represent myself in a good colouring than my own natural complexion i have no more make my book than my book have make me tis a book consubstantial with the author of a peculiar design a parcel of my life and whose business be not design for other a that of all other book be in give myself so continual and so exact an account of myself have i lose my time for they who sometimes cursorily survey themselves only do not so strictly examine themselves nor penetrate so deep a he who make it hi business hi study and hi employment who intend a lasting record with all hi fidelity and with all hi force the most delicious pleasure digest within avoid leave any trace of themselves and avoid the sight not only of the people but of any other person how often have this work divert me from troublesome thought and all that be frivolous should be repute so nature have present u with a large faculty of entertain ourselves alone and often call u to it to teach u that we owe ourselves in part to society but chiefly and mostly to ourselves that i may habituate my fancy even to meditate in some method and to some end and to keep it from lose itself and rove at random ti but to give to body and to record all the little thought that present themselves to it i give ear to my whimsy because i be to record them it often fall out that be displease at some action that civility and reason will not permit me openly to reprove i here disgorge myself not without design of public instruction and also these poetical lash imprint themselves good upon paper than upon the flesh what if i listen to book a little more attentively than ordinary since i watch if i can purloin anything that may adorn or support my own i have not at all study to make a book but i have in some sort study because i have make it if it be study to scratch and pinch now one author and then another either by the head or foot not with any design to form opinion from them but to assist second and fortify those i already have embrace but whom shall we believe in the report he make of himself in so corrupt an age consider there be so few if any at all whom we can believe when speaking of other where there be less interest to lie the first thing do in the corruption of manner be banish truth for a pindar say to be true be the beginning of a great virtue and the first article that plato require in the governor of hi republic the truth of these day be not that which really be but what every man persuade another man to believe a we generally give the name of money not only to piece of the dust alloy but even to the false also if they will pass our nation have long be reproach with this vice for salvianus of marseille who live in the time of the emperor valentinian say that lie and forswear themselves be with the french not a vice but a way of speaking he who would enhance this testimony might say that it be now a virtue in them men form and fashion themselves to it a to an exercise of honour for dissimulation be one of the most notable quality of this age i have often consider whence this custom that we so religiously observe should spring of be more highly offend with the reproach of a vice so familiar to u than with any other and that it should be the high insult that can in word be do u to reproach u with a lie upon examination i find that it be natural most to defend the defect with which we be most tainted it seem a if by resent and be move at the accusation we in some sort acquit ourselves of the fault though we have it in effect we condemn it in outward appearance may it not also be that this reproach seem to imply cowardice and feebleness of heart of which can there be a more manifest sign than to eat a man own wordsnay to lie against a man own knowledge lying be a base vice a vice that one of the ancient portray in the most odious colour when he say that it be to manifest a contempt of god and withal a fear of men it be not possible more fully to represent the horror baseness and irregularity of it for what can a man imagine more hateful and contemptible than to be a coward towards men and valiant against hi maker our intelligence be by no other way communicable to one another but by a particular word he who falsify that betray public society ti the only way by which we communicate our thought and will tis the interpreter of the soul and if it deceive u we no longer know nor have further tie upon one another if that deceive u it break all our correspondence and dissolve all the tie of government certain nation of the newly discover indie i need not give them names see they be no more for by wonderful and unheardof example the desolation of that conquest have extend to the utter abolition of name and the ancient knowledge of place offer to their god human blood but only such a be draw from the tongue and ear to expiate for the sin of lie as well heard a pronounce that good fellow of greece say that child be amuse with toy and men with word a to our diverse usage of give the lie and the law of honour in that case and the alteration they have receive i defer say what i know of them to another time and shall learn if i can in the meanwhile at what time the custom take beginning of so exactly weigh and measure word and of make our honour interested in them for it be easy to judge that it be not anciently amongst the roman and greek and it have often seem to me strange to see them rail at and give one another the lie without any quarrel their law of duty steer some other course than ours caesar be sometimes call thief and sometimes drunkard to hi teeth we see the liberty of invective they practise upon one another i mean the great chief of war of both nation where word be only revenge with word and do not proceed any farther ti usual to see good intention if carry on without moderation push men on to very vicious effect in this dispute which have at this time engage france in a civil war the good and the sound cause no doubt be that which maintain the ancient religion and government of the kingdom nevertheless amongst the good men of that party for i do not speak of those who only make a pretence of it either to execute their own particular revenge or to gratify their avarice or to conciliate the favour of prince but of those who engage in the quarrel out of true zeal to religion and a holy desire to maintain the peace and government of their country of these i say we see many whom passion transport beyond the bound of reason and sometimes inspires with counsel that be unjust and violent and moreover rash it be certain that in those first time when our religion begin to gain authority with the law zeal arm many against all sort of pagan book by which the learn suffer an exceed great loss a disorder that i conceive to have do more prejudice to letter than all the flame of the barbarian of this cornelius tacitus be a very good testimony for though the emperor tacitus hi kinsman have by express order furnish all the library in the world with it nevertheless one entire copy could not escape the curious examination of those who desire to abolish it for only five or six idle clause that be contrary to our belief they have also the trick easily to lend undue praise to all the emperor who make for u and universally to condemn all the action of those who be adversary a be evidently manifest in the emperor julian surnamed the apostate who be in truth a very great and rare man a man in whose soul philosophy be imprint in the best character by which he profess to govern all hi action and in truth there be no sort of virtue of which he have not leave behind him very notable example in chastity of which the whole of hi life give manifest proof we read the same of him that be say of alexander and scipio that be in the flower of hi age for he be slay by the parthian at oneandthirty of a great many very beautiful captive he would not so much a look upon one a to hi justice he take himself the pain to hear the party and although he would out of curiosity inquire what religion they be of nevertheless the antipathy he have to ours never give any counterpoise to the balance he make himself several good law and repeal a great part of the subsidy and tax levy by hi predecessor we have two good historian who be eyewitness of hi action one of whom marcellinus in several place of hi history sharply reprove an edict of hi whereby he interdict all christian rhetorician and grammarian to keep school or to teach and say he could wish that act of hi have be bury in silence it be probable that have he do any more severe thing against u he so affectionate a he be to our party would not have pass it over in silence he be indeed sharp against u but yet no cruel enemy for our own people tell this story of him that one day walk about the city of chalcedon mari bishop of the place be so bold a to tell him that he be impious and an enemy to christ at which they say he be no far move than to reply go poor wretch and lament the loss of thy eye to which the bishop reply again i thank jesus christ for take away my sight that i may not see thy impudent visage affect in that they say a philosophical patience but this action of hi bear no comparison to the cruelty that he be say to have exercise against u he be say eutropius my other witness an enemy to christianity but without put hi hand to blood and to return to hi justice there be nothing in that whereof he can be accuse the severity except he practise in the beginning of hi reign against those who have follow the party of constantius hi predecessor a to hi sobriety he live always a soldierlike life and observe a diet and routine like one that prepare and inure himself to the austerity of war hi vigilance be such that he divide the night into three or four part of which the least be dedicate to sleep the rest be spend either in visit the state of hi army and guard in person or in study for amongst other rare quality he be very excellent in all sort of learn ti say of alexander the great that be in bed for fear l sleep should divert him from hi thought and study he have always a basin set by hi bedside and hold one of hi hand out with a ball of copper in it to the end that begin to fall asleep and hi finger leave their hold the ball by fall into the basin might awake him but the other have hi soul so bent upon what he have a mind to do and so little disturbed with fume by reason of hi singular abstinence that he have no need of any such invention a to hi military experience he be excellent in all the quality of a great captain a it be likely he should be almost all hi life in a continual exercise of war and most of that time with u in france against the german and frank we hardly read of any man who ever saw more danger or who make more frequent proof of hi personal valour hi death have something in it parallel with that of epaminondas for he be wound with an arrow and try to pull it out and have do so but that be edge it cut and disable hi hand he incessantly call out that they should carry him again into the heat of the battle to encourage hi soldier who very bravely dispute the fight without him till night part the army he stand oblige to hi philosophy for the singular contempt he have for hi life and all human thing he have a firm belief of the immortality of soul in matter of religion he be wrong throughout and be surnamed the apostate for have relinquish ours nevertheless the opinion seem to me more probable that he have never thoroughly embrace it but have dissemble out of obedience to the law till he come to the empire he be in hi own so superstitious that he be laugh at for it by those of hi own time of the same opinion who jeeringly say that have he get the victory over the parthian he have destroy the breed of ox in the world to supply hi sacrifice he be moreover besotted with the art of divination and give authority to all sort of prediction he say amongst other thing at hi death that he be oblige to the god and thank them in that they would not cut him off by surprise have long before advertise him of the place and hour of hi death nor by a mean and unmanly death more become lazy and delicate people nor by a death that be languish long and painful and that they have think him worthy to die after that noble manner in the progress of hi victory in the flower of hi glory he have a vision like that of marcus brutus that first threaten him in gaul and afterward appear to him in persia just before hi death these word that some make him say when he felt himself wound thou hast overcome nazarene or a other content thyself nazarene would hardly have be omit have they be believe by my witness who be present in the army have set down to the least motion and word of hi end no more than certain other miracle that be report about it and to return to my subject he long nourish say marcellinus paganism in hi heart but all hi army be christian he durst not own it but in the end see himself strong enough to dare to discover himself he cause the temple of the god to be throw open and do hi uttermost to set on foot and to encourage idolatry which the good to effect have at constantinople find the people disunite and also the prelate of the church divide amongst themselves have convene them all before him he earnestly admonish them to calm those civil dissension and that every one might freely and without fear follow hi own religion which he the more sedulously solicit in hope that this licence would augment the schism and faction of their division and hinder the people from reunite and consequently fortify themselves against him by their unanimous intelligence and concord have experience by the cruelty of some christian that there be no beast in the world so much to be fear by man a man these be very nearly hi word wherein this be very worthy of consideration that the emperor julian make use of the same receipt of liberty of conscience to inflame the civil dissension that our king do to extinguish them so that a man may say on one side that to give the people the rein to entertain every man hi own opinion be to scatter and sow division and a it be to lend a hand to augment it there be no legal impediment or restraint to stop or hinder their career but on the other side a man may also say that to give the people the rein to entertain every man hi own opinion be to mollify and appease them by facility and toleration and to dull the point which be whet and make sharper by singularity novelty and difficulty and i think it be well for the honour of the devotion of our king that not have be able to do what they would they have make a show of be willing to do what they could the feebleness of our condition be such that thing can not in their natural simplicity and purity fall into our use the element that we enjoy be change and so tis with metal and gold must be debase with some other matter to fit it for our service neither have virtue so simple a that which aristo pyrrho and also the stoic make the end of life nor the cyrenaic and aristippic pleasure be without mixture useful to it of the pleasure and good that we enjoy there be not one exempt from some mixture of ill and inconvenience our extreme pleasure have some sort of groaning and complaining in it would you not say that it be die of pain nay when we frame the image of it in it full excellence we stuff it with sickly and painful epithet and quality languor softness feebleness faintness morbidezza a great testimony of their consanguinity and consubstantiality the most profound joy have more of severity than gaiety in it the high and full contentment offer more of the grave than of the merry pleasure chew and grind u accord to the old greek verse which say that the god sell u all the good they give u that be to say that they give u nothing pure and perfect and that we do not purchase but at the price of some evil labour and pleasure very unlike in nature associate nevertheless by i know not what natural conjunction socrates say that some god try to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure but not be able to do it he bethink him at least to couple them by the tail metrodorus say that in sorrow there be some mixture of pleasure i know not whether or no he intend anything els by that say but for my part i be of opinion that there be design consent and complacency in give a man self up to melancholy i say that besides ambition which may also have a stroke in the business there be some shadow of delight and delicacy which smile upon and flatters u even in the very lap of melancholy are there not some constitution that fee upon it and one attalus in seneca say that the memory of our lose friend be as grateful to u a bitterness in wine when too old be to the palate and a apple that have a sweet tartness nature discover this confusion to u painter hold that the same motion and grimace of the face that serve for weep serve for laughter too and indeed before the one or the other be finish do but observe the painter manner of handle and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tend and the extreme of laughter do at last bring tear when i imagine man abound with all the convenience that be to be desire let u put the case that all hi member be always seize with a pleasure like that of generation in it most excessive height i feel him melt under the weight of hi delight and see him utterly unable to support so pure so continual and so universal a pleasure indeed he be run away whilst he be there and naturally make haste to escape a from a place where he can not stand firm and where he be afraid of sink when i religiously confess myself to myself i find that the best virtue i have have in it some tincture of vice and i be afraid that plato in hi purest virtue i who be a sincere and loyal a lover of virtue of that stamp a any other whatever if he have listen and lay hi ear close to himself and he do so no doubtwould have hear some jarring note of human mixture but faint and only perceptible to himself man be wholly and throughout but patch and motley even the law of justice themselves can not subsist without mixture of injustice insomuch that plato say they undertake to cut off the hydra head who pretend to clear the law of all inconvenience say tacitus it be likewise true that for the use of life and the service of public commerce there may be some excess in the purity and perspicacity of our mind that penetrate light have in it too much of subtlety and curiosity we must a little stupefy and blunt them to render them more obedient to example and practice and a little veil and obscure them the good to proportion them to this dark and earthly life and therefore common and less speculative soul be find to be more proper for and more successful in the management of affair and the elevated and exquisite opinion of philosophy unfit for business this sharp vivacity of soul and the supple and restless volubility attend it disturb our negotiation we be to manage human enterprise more superficially and roughly and leave a great part to fortune it be not necessary to examine affair with so much subtlety and so deep a man lose himself in the consideration of many contrary lustre and so many various form tis what the ancient say of simonides that by reason hi imagination suggest to him upon the question king hiero have put to him to answer which he have have many day for thought several sharp and subtle consideration whilst he doubt which be the most likely he totally despair of the truth he who dive into and in hi inquisition comprehend all circumstance and consequence hinders hi election a little engine well handle be sufficient for execution whether of less or great weight the best manager be those who can worst give account how they be so while the great talker for the most part do nothing to purpose i know one of this sort of men and a most excellent discourser upon all sort of good husbandry who have miserably let a hundred thousand livres yearly revenue slip through hi hand i know another who talk who well advises than any man of hi counsel and there be not in the world a fair show of soul and understanding than he have nevertheless when he come to the test hi servant find him quite another thing not to make any mention of hi misfortune the emperor vespasian be sick of the disease whereof he die do not for all that neglect to inquire after the state of the empire and even in bed continually despatch very many affair of great consequence for which be reprove by hi physician a a thing prejudicial to hi health an emperor say he must die stand a fine saying in my opinion and worthy a great prince the emperor adrian since make use of the same word and king should be often put in mind of them to make them know that the great office confer upon them of the command of so many men be not an employment of ease and that there be nothing can so justly disgust a subject and make him unwilling to expose himself to labour and danger for the service of hi prince than to see him in the meantime devote to hi ease and frivolous amusement and to be solicitous of hi preservation who so much neglect that of hi people whoever will take upon him to maintain that ti better for a prince to carry on hi war by other than in hi own person fortune will furnish him with example enough of those whose lieutenant have bring great enterprise to a happy issue and of those also whose presence have do more hurt than good but no virtuous and valiant prince can with patience endure so dishonourable council under colour of save hi head like the statue of a saint for the happiness of hi kingdom they degrade him from and declare him incapable of hi office which be military throughout i know one who have much rather be beat than to sleep whilst another fight for him and who never without jealousy heard of any brave thing do even by hi own officer in hi absence and soliman i say with very good reason in my opinion that victory obtain without the master be never complete much more would he have say that that master ought to blush for shame to pretend to any share in the honour have contribute nothing to the work but hi voice and think nor even so much a these consider that in such work a that the direction and command that deserve honour be only such a be give upon the spot and in the heat of the business no pilot perform hi office by stand still the prince of the ottoman family the chiefest in the world in military fortune have warmly embrace this opinion and bajazet ii with hi son who swerve from it spend their time in science and other retired employment give great blow to their empire and amurath iii now reign follow their example begin to find the same wa it not edward iii king of england who say this of our charles v there never be king who so seldom put on hi armour and yet never king who give me so much to do he have reason to think it strange a an effect of chance more than of reason and let those seek out some other to join with them than me who will reckon the king of castile and portugal amongst the warlike and magnanimous conqueror because at the distance of twelve hundred league from their lazy abode by the conduct of their captain they make themselves master of both indie of which it have to be know if they would have have even the courage to go and in person enjoy them the emperor julian say yet further that a philosopher and a brave man ought not so much a to breathe that be to say not to allow any more to bodily necessity than what we can not refuse keep the soul and body still intent and busy about honourable great and virtuous thing he be ashamed if any one in public saw him spit or sweat which be say by some also of the lacedaemonian young men and which xenophon say of the persian forasmuch a he conceive that exercise continual labour and sobriety ought to have dry up all those superfluity what seneca say will not be unfit for this place which be that the ancient roman keep their youth always stand and teach them nothing that they be to learn sit ti a generous desire to wish to die usefully and like a man but the effect lie not so much in our resolution a in our good fortune a thousand have propose to themselves in battle either to overcome or to die who have fail both in the one and the other wound and imprisonment cross their design and compel them to live against their will there be disease that overthrow even our desire and our knowledge fortune ought not to second the vanity of the roman legion who bind themselves by oath either to overcome or die the portuguese say that in a certain place of their conquest of the indie they meet with soldier who have condemn themselves with horrible execration to enter into no other composition but either to cause themselves to be slay or to remain victorious and have their head and beard shave in token of this vow ti to much purpose for u to hazard ourselves and to be obstinate it seem a if blow avoid those who present themselves too briskly to them and do not willingly fall upon those who too willingly seek them and so defeat them of their design such there have be who after have try all way not have be able with all their endeavour to obtain the favour of die by the hand of the enemy have be constrain to make good their resolution of bring home the honour of victory or of lose their life to kill themselves even in the heat of battle of which there be other example but this be one philistus general of the naval army of dionysius the younger against the syracusans present them battle which be sharply dispute their force be equal in this engagement he have the good at the first through hi own valour but the syracusans draw about hi gally to environ him after have do great thing in hi own person to disengage himself and hop for no relief with hi own hand he take away the life he have so liberally and in vain expose to the enemy mule moloch king of fez who lately win against sebastian king of portugal the battle so famous for the death of three king and for the transmission of that great kingdom to the crown of castile be extremely sick when the portuguese enter in an hostile manner into hi dominion and from that day forward grow bad and bad still draw nearer to and foresee hi end yet never do man well employ hi own sufficiency more vigorously and bravely than he do upon this occasion he find himself too weak to undergo the pomp and ceremony of enter into hi camp which after their manner be very magnificent and therefore resign that honour to hi brother but this be all of the office of a general that he resign all the rest of great utility and necessity he most exactly and gloriously perform in hi own person hi body lie upon a couch but hi judgment and courage upright and firm to hi last gasp and in some sort beyond it he might have waste hi enemy indiscreetly advance into hi dominion without strike a blow and it be a very unhappy occurrence that for want of a little life or somebody to substitute in the conduct of this war and the affair of a troubled state he be compel to seek a doubtful and bloody victory have another by a good and sure way already in hi hand notwithstanding he wonderfully manage the continuance of hi sickness in consume the enemy and in draw them far from the assistance of the navy and the port they have on the coast of africa even till the last day of hi life which he designedly reserve for this great battle he arrange hi battalion in a circular form environ the portuguese army on every side which round circle come to close in and to draw up close together not only hinder them in the conflict which be very sharp through the valour of the young invading king consider that they have every way to present a front but prevent their flight after the defeat so that find all passage possess and shut up by the enemy they be constrain to close up together again and there they be slay in heap upon one another leave to the conqueror a very bloody and entire victory die he cause himself to be carry and hurry from place to place where most need be and pass along the file encourage the captain and soldier one after another but a corner of hi main battalion be broken he be not to be hold from mount on horseback with hi sword in hi hand he do hi utmost to break from those about him and to rush into the thickest of the battle they all the while withhold him some by the bridle some by hi robe and other by hi stirrup this last effort totally overwhelm the little life he have leave they again lay him upon hi bed but come to himself and start a it be out of hi swoon all other faculty fail to give hi people notice that they be to conceal hi death the most necessary command he have then to give that hi soldier might not be discourage with the news he expire with hi finger upon hi mouth the ordinary sign of keep silence who ever live so long and so far into death whoever die so erect or more like a man the most extreme degree of courageously treat death and the most natural be to look upon it not only without astonishment but without care continue the wonted course of life even into it a cato do who entertain himself in study and go to sleep have a violent and bloody death in hi heart and the weapon in hi hand with which he be resolve to despatch himself i have be none of the least able in this exercise which be proper for men of my pitch wellknit and short but i give it over it shake u too much to continue it long i be at this moment reading that king cyrus the good to have news bring him from all part of the empire which be of a vast extent cause it to be try how far a horse could go in a day without bait and at that distance appoint men whose business it be to have horse always in readiness to mount those who be despatch to him and some say that this swift way of posting be equal to that of the flight of crane caesar say that lucius vibullius rufus be in great haste to carry intelligence to pompey rode night and day still take fresh horse for the great diligence and speed and he himself a suetonius report travel a hundred mile a day in a hired coach but he be a furious courier for where the river stop hi way he pass them by swim without turn out of hi way to look for either bridge or ford tiberius nero go to see hi brother drusus who be sick in germany travel two hundred mile in fourandtwenty hour have three coach in the war of the roman against king antiochus t sempronius gracchus say livy and it appear that they be establish post and not horse purposely lay in upon this occasion cecinas invention to send back news to hi family be much more quick for he take swallow along with him from home and turn them out towards their nest when he would send back any news set a mark of some colour upon them to signify hi mean accord to what he and hi people have before agree upon at the theatre at rome master of family carry pigeon in their bosom to which they tie letter when they have a mind to send any order to their people at home and the pigeon be train up to bring back an answer d brutus make use of the same device when besiege in modena and other elsewhere have do the same in peru they ride post upon men who take them upon their shoulder in a certain kind of litter make for that purpose and ran with such agility that in their full speed the first courier transfer their load to the second without make any stop i understand that the wallachians the grand signior courier perform wonderful journey by reason they have liberty to dismount the first person they meet upon the road give him their own tired horse and that to preserve themselves from be weary they gird themselves straight about the middle with a broad girdle but i could never find any benefit from this there be wonderful relation and correspondence in this universal government of the work of nature which very well make it appear that it be neither accidental nor carry on by diver master the disease and condition of our body be in like manner manifest in state and government kingdom and republic be found flourish and decay with age a we do we be subject to a repletion of humour useless and dangerous whether of those that be good for even those the physician be afraid of and see we have nothing in u that be stable they say that a too brisk and vigorous perfection of health must be abate by art l our nature unable to rest in any certain condition and not have whither to rise to mend itself make too sudden and too disorderly a retreat and therefore prescribe wrestler to purge and bleed to qualify that superabundant health or els a repletion of evil humour which be the ordinary cause of sickness state be very often sick of the like repletion and various sort of purgation have commonly be apply some time a great multitude of family be turn out to clear the country who seek out new abode elsewhere and encroach upon other after this manner our ancient frank come from the remote part of germany to seize upon gaul and to drive thence the first inhabitant so be that infinite deluge of men make up who come into italy under the conduct of brennus and other so the goth and vandal and also the people who now possess greece leave their native country to go settle elsewhere where they might have more room and there be scarce two or three little corner in the world that have not felt the effect of such removal the roman by this mean erect their colony for perceive their city to grow immeasurably populous they ease it of the most unnecessary people and send them to inhabit and cultivate the land conquer by them sometimes also they purposely maintain war with some of their enemy not only to keep their own men in action for fear l idleness the mother of corruption should bring upon them some bad inconvenience but also to serve for a bloodletting to their republic and a little to evaporate the too vehement heat of their youth to prune and clear the branch from the stock too luxuriant in wood and to this end it be that they maintain so long a war with carthage in the treaty of bretigny edward iii king of england would not in the general peace he then make with our king comprehend the controversy about the duchy of brittany that he might have a place wherein to discharge himself of hi soldier and that the vast number of english he have bring over to serve him in hi expedition here might not return back into england and this also be one reason why our king philip consent to send hi son john upon a foreign expedition that he might take along with him a great number of hot young men who be then in hi pay there be many in our time who talk at this rate wish that this hot emotion that be now amongst u might discharge itself in some neighbouring war for fear l all the peccant humour that now reign in this politic body of ours may diffuse themselves far keep the fever still in the height and at last cause our total ruin and in truth a foreign be much more supportable than a civil war but i do not believe that god will favour so unjust a design a to offend and quarrel with other for our own advantage and yet the weakness of our condition often push u upon the necessity of make use of ill mean to a good end lycurgus the most perfect legislator that ever be virtuous and invent this very unjust practice of make the helot who be their slave drink by force to the end that the spartan see them so lose and bury in wine might abhor the excess of this vice and yet those be still more to blame who of old give leave that criminal to what sort of death soever condemn should be cut up alive by the physician that they might make a true discovery of our inward part and build their art upon great certainty for if we must run into excess it be more excusable to do it for the health of the soul than that of the body a the roman train up the people to valour and the contempt of danger and death by those furious spectacle of gladiator and fencer who have to fight it out to the last cut mangle and kill one another in their presence and this custom continue till the emperor theodosius time it be in truth a wonderful example and of great advantage for the training up the people to see every day before their eye a hundred two hundred nay a thousand couple of men arm against one another cut one another to piece with so great a constancy of courage that they be never hear to utter so much a one syllable of weakness or commiseration never see to turn their back nor so much a to make one cowardly step to evade a blow but rather expose their neck to the adversary sword and present themselves to receive the stroke and many of them when wound to death have send to ask the spectator if they be satisfy with their behaviour before they lay down to die upon the place it be not enough for them to fight and to die bravely but cheerfully too insomuch that they be hiss and curse if they make any hesitation about receive their death the very girls themselves set them on the first roman only condemn criminal to this example but they afterwards employ innocent slave in the work and even freeman too who sell themselves to this purpose nay moreover senator and knight of rome and also woman which i should think strange and incredible if we be not accustomed every day to see in our own war many thousand of men of other nation for money to stake their blood and their life in quarrel wherein they have no manner of concern i will only say a word or two of this infinite argument to show the simplicity of those who compare the pitiful greatness of these time with that of rome in the seventh book of cicero familiar epistle and let the grammarian put out that surname of familiar if they please for in truth it be not very suitable and they who instead of familiar have substitute ad familiar may gather something to justify them for so do out of what suetonius say in the life of caesar that there be a volume of letter of hi ad familiar there be one direct to caesar then in gaul wherein cicero repeat these word which be in the end of another letter that caesar have write to him a to what concern marcus furius whom you have recommend to me i will make him king of gaul and if you would have me advance any other friend of yours send him to me it be no new thing for a simple citizen of rome a caesar then be to dispose of kingdom for he take away that of king deiotarus from him to give it to a gentleman of the city of pergamus call mithridates and they who write hi life record several city sell by him and suetonius say that he have once from king ptolemy three million and six hundred thousand crown which be very like sell him hi own kingdom marcus antonius say that the greatness of the people of rome be not so much see in what they take as in what they give and indeed some age before antonius they have dethrone one amongst the rest with so wonderful authority that in all the roman history i have not observe anything that more denote the height of their power antiochus possess all egypt and be moreover ready to conquer cyprus and other appendage of that empire when be upon the progress of hi victory c popilius come to him from the senate and at their first meeting refuse to take him by the hand till he have first read hi letter which after the king have read and tell him he would consider of them popilius make a circle about him with hi cane say return me an answer that i may carry it back to the senate before thou stirrest out of this circle antiochus astonish at the roughness of so positive a command after a little pause reply i will obey the senate command then popilius salute him a friend of the roman people to have renounce claim to so great a monarchy and a course of such successful fortune from the effect of three line in write truly he have reason a he afterwards do to send the senate word by hi ambassador that he have receive their order with the same respect a if it have come from the immortal god all the kingdom that augustus gain by the right of war he either restore to those who have lose them or present them to stranger and tacitus in reference to this speaking of cogidunus king of england give u by a marvellous touch an instance of that infinite power the roman say he be from all antiquity accustom to leave the king they have subdue in possession of their kingdom under their authority ti probable that solyman whom we have see make a gift of hungary and other principality have therein more respect to this consideration than to that he be wont to allege viz that he be glut and overcharge with so many monarchy and so much dominion a hi own valour and that of hi ancestor have acquire there be an epigram in martial and one of the very good one for he have of all sort where he pleasantly tell the story of caelius who to avoid make hi court to some great men of rome to wait their rising and to attend them abroad pretend to have the gout and the good to colour this anoint hi leg and have them lap up in a great many swathing and perfectly counterfeit both the gesture and countenance of a gouty person till in the end fortune do him the kindness to make him one indeed i think i have read somewhere in appian a story like this of one who to escape the proscription of the triumvir of rome and the good to be conceal from the discovery of those who pursue him have hide himself in a disguise would yet add this invention to counterfeit have but one eye but when he come to have a little more liberty and go to take off the plaster he have a great while worn over hi eye he find he have totally lose the sight of it indeed and that it be absolutely go ti possible that the action of sight be dull from have be so long without exercise and that the optic power be wholly retire into the other eye for we evidently perceive that the eye we keep shut sends some part of it virtue to it fellow so that it will swell and grow big and so inaction with the heat of ligature and plaster might very well have bring some gouty humour upon the counterfeiter in martial reading in froissart the vow of a troop of young english gentleman to keep their left eye bind up till they have arrive in france and perform some notable exploit upon u i have often be tickle with this thought that it might have befall them a it do those other and they might have return with but an eye apiece to their mistress for whose sake they have make this ridiculous vow mother have reason to rebuke their child when they counterfeit have but one eye squint lameness or any other personal defect for besides that their body be then so tender may be subject to take an ill bent fortune i know not how sometimes seem to delight in take u at our word and i have hear several example relate of people who have become really sick by only feign to be so i have always use whether on horseback or on foot to carry a stick in my hand and even to affect do it with an elegant air many have threaten that this fancy would one day be turn into necessity if so i should be the first of my family to have the gout but let u a little lengthen this chapter and add another anecdote concern blindness pliny report of one who dream he be blind find himself so indeed in the morning without any precede infirmity in hi eye the force of imagination might assist in this case a i have say elsewhere and pliny seem to be of the same opinion but it be more likely that the motion which the body felt within of which physician if they please may find out the cause take away hi sight be the occasion of hi dream let u add another story not very improper for this subject which seneca relate in one of hi epistle you know say he write to lucilius that harpaste my wife fool be throw upon me a an hereditary charge for i have naturally an aversion to those monster and if i have a mind to laugh at a fool i need not seek him far i can laugh at myself this fool have suddenly lose her sight i tell you a strange but a very true thing she be not sensible that she be blind but eternally importune her keeper to take her abroad because she say the house be dark that what we laugh at in her i pray you to believe happens to every one of u no one know himself to be avaricious or grasping and again the blind call for a guide while we stray of our own accord i be not ambitious we say but a man can not live otherwise at rome i be not wasteful but the city require a great outlay ti not my fault if i be choleric if i have not yet establish any certain course of life ti the fault of youth let u not seek our disease out of ourselves tis in u and plant in our bowel and the mere fact that we do not perceive ourselves to be sick render u more hard to be cure if we do not betimes begin to see to ourselves when shall we have provide for so many wound and evil wherewith we abound and yet we have a most sweet and charm medicine in philosophy for of all the rest we be sensible of no pleasure till after the cure this plea and heals at once this be what seneca say that have carry me from my subject but there be advantage in the change tacitus report that amongst certain barbarian king their manner be when they would make a firm obligation to join their right hand close to one another and intertwist their thumb and when by force of strain the blood it appear in the end they lightly prick them with some sharp instrument and mutually suck them physician say that the thumb be the master finger of the hand and that their latin etymology be derive from pollere the greek call them avtixeip a who should say another hand and it seem that the latin also sometimes take it in this sense for the whole hand it be at rome a signification of favour to depress and turn in the thumb and of disfavour to elevate and thrust them outward the roman exempt from war all such a be maim in the thumb a have no more sufficient strength to hold their weapon augustus confiscate the estate of a roman knight who have maliciously cut off the thumb of two young child he have to excuse them from go into the army and before him the senate in the time of the italic war have condemn caius vatienus to perpetual imprisonment and confiscate all hi good for have purposely cut off the thumb of hi left hand to exempt himself from that expedition some one i have forget who have win a naval battle cut off the thumb of all hi vanquished enemy to render them incapable of fight and of handle the oar the athenian also cause the thumb of the aeginatans to be cut off to deprive them of the superiority in the art of navigation in lacedaemon pedagogue chastise their scholar by bite their thumb i have often hear it say that cowardice be the mother of cruelty and i have find by experience that malicious and inhuman animosity and fierceness be usually accompany with feminine weakness i have see the most cruel people and upon frivolous occasion apt to cry alexander the tyrant of pheres durst not be a spectator of tragedy in the theatre for fear l hi citizen should see him weep at the misfortune of hecuba and andromache who himself without pity cause so many people every day to be murder be it not meanness of spirit that render them so pliable to all extremity valour whose effect be only to be exercise against resistance stop when it see the enemy at it mercy but pusillanimity to say that it be also in the game not have dare to meddle in the first act of danger take a it part the second of blood and massacre the murder in victory be commonly perform by the rascality and hangerson of an army and that which cause so many unheard of cruelty in domestic war be that this canaille make war in imbrue itself up to the elbow in blood and rip up a body that lie prostrate at it foot have no sense of any other valour like cowardly dog that in the house worry and tear the skin of wild beast they durst not come near in the field what be it in these time of ours that make our quarrel mortal and that whereas our father have some degree of revenge we now begin with the last in ours and at the first meeting nothing be to be say but kill what be this but cowardice every one be sensible that there be more bravery and disdain in subdue an enemy than in cut hi throat and in make him yield than in put him to the sword besides that the appetite of revenge be well satisfied and pleased because it only aim be to make itself felt and this be the reason why we do not fall upon a beast or a stone when they hurt u because they be not capable of be sensible of our revenge and to kill a man be to save him from the injury and offence we intend him and a bias cry out to a wicked fellow i know that sooner or later thou wilt have thy reward but i be afraid i shall not see it and pity the orchomenians that the penitence of lyciscus for the treason commit against them come at a season when there be no one remain alive of those who have be interested in the offence and whom the pleasure of this penitence should affect so revenge be to be pity when the person on whom it be execute be deprive of mean of suffer under it for a the avenger will look on to enjoy the pleasure of hi revenge so the person on whom he take revenge should be a spectator too to be afflict and to repent he will repent it we say and because we have give him a pistolshot through the head do we imagine he will repent on the contrary if we but observe we shall find that he make mouth at u in fall and be so far from penitency that he do not so much a repine at u and we do him the kind office of life which be to make him die insensibly and soon we be afterwards to hide ourselves and to shift and fly from the officer of justice who pursue u whilst he be at rest killing be good to frustrate an offence to come not to revenge one that be already past and more an act of fear than of bravery of precaution than of courage of defence than of enterprise it be manifest that by it we lose both the true end of revenge and the care of our reputation we be afraid if he live he will do u another injury as great a the first ti not out of animosity to him but care of thyself that thou gettest rid of him in the kingdom of narsingah this expedient would be useless to u where not only soldier but tradesman also end their difference by the sword the king never deny the field to any who wish to fight and when they be person of quality he look on reward the victor with a chain of goldfor which any one who please may fight with him again so that by have come off from one combat he have engage himself in many if we think by virtue to be always master of our enemy and to triumph over them at pleasure we should be sorry they should escape from u a they do by die but we have a mind to conquer more with safety than honour and in our quarrel more pursue the end than the glory asnius pollio who a be a worthy man be the less to be excuse commit a like error when have write a libel against plancus he forbear to publish it till he be dead which be to bite one thumb at a blind man to rail at one who be deaf to wind a man who have no feeling rather than to run the hazard of hi resentment and it be also say of him that it be only for hobgoblin to wrestle with the dead he who stay to see the author die whose writing he intend to question what do he say but that he be weak in hi aggressiveness it be tell to aristotle that some one have speak ill of him let him do more say he let him whip me too provide i be not there our father content themselves with revenge an insult with the lie the lie with a box of the ear and so forward they be valiant enough not to fear their adversary live and provoke we tremble for fear so soon a we see them on foot and that this be so do not our noble practice of these day equally to prosecute to death both him that have offend u and him we have offend make it out ti also a kind of cowardice that have introduce the custom of have second third and fourth in our duel they be formerly duel they be now skirmishes rencontres and battle solitude be doubtless terrible to those who be the first inventor of this practice for naturally any company whatever be consolatory in danger third person be formerly call in to prevent disorder and foul play only and to be witness of the fortune of the combat but now they have bring it to this pas that the witness themselves engage whoever be invite can not handsomely stand by a an idle spectator for fear of be suspect either of want of affection or of courage besides the injustice and unworthiness of such an action of engage other strength and valour in the protection of your honour than your own i conceive it a disadvantage to a brave man and who wholly rely upon himself to shuffle hi fortune with that of a second every one run hazard enough himself without hazard for another and have enough to do to assure himself in hi own valour for the defence of hi life without intrust a thing so dear in a third man hand for if it be not expressly agree upon before to the contrary ti a combined party of all four and if your second be kill you have two to deal withal with good reason and to say that it be foul play it be so indeed a it be well arm to attack a man who have but the hilt of a broken sword in hi hand or clear and untouched a man who be desperately wound but if these be advantage you have get by fight you may make use of them without reproach the disparity and inequality be only weighed and consider from the condition of the combatant when they begin a to the rest you must take your chance and though you have alone three enemy upon you at once your two companion be kill you have no more wrong do you than i should do in a battle by run a man through whom i should see engage with one of our own men with the like advantage the nature of society will have it so that where there be troop against troop a where our duke of orleans challenge henry king of england a hundred against a hundred three hundred against as many a the argians against the lacedaemonians three to three a the horatii against the curiatii the multitude on either side be consider but a one single man the hazard wherever there be company be confuse and mixed i have a domestic interest in this discourse for my brother the sieur de mattecoulom be at rome ask by a gentleman with whom he have no great acquaintance and who be a defendant challenge by another to be hi second in this duel he find himself match with a gentleman much good know to him i would fain have an explanation of these rule of honour which so often shock and confound those of reason after have despatch hi man see the two principal still on foot and sound he run in to disengage hi friend what could he do less should he have stand still and if chance would have order it so have see him he be come thither to defend kill before hi face what he have hitherto do help not the business the quarrel be yet undecided the courtesy that you can and certainly ought to shew to your enemy when you have reduce him to an ill condition and have a great advantage over him i do not see how you can do it where the interest of another be concern where you be only call in a an assistant and the quarrel be none of yours he could neither be just nor courteous at the hazard of him he be there to serve and he be therefore enlarge from the prison of italy at the speedy and solemn request of our king indiscreet nation we be not content to make our vice and folly know to the world by report only but we must go into foreign country there to show them what fool we be put three frenchman into the desert of libya they will not live a month together without fight so that you would say this peregrination be a thing purposely design to give foreigner the pleasure of our tragedy and for the most part to such a rejoice and laugh at our misery we go into italy to learn to fence and exercise the art at the expense of our life before we have learn it and yet by the rule of discipline we should put the theory before the practice we discover ourselves to be but learners i know that fencing be an art very useful to it end in a duel betwixt two prince cousingermans in spain the elder say livy by hi skill and dexterity in arm easily overcome the great and more awkward strength of the young and of which the knowledge a i experimentally know have inspire some with courage above their natural measure but this be not properly valour because it support itself upon address and be found upon something besides itself the honour of combat consist in the jealousy of courage and not of skill and therefore i have know a friend of mine famed a a great master in this exercise in hi quarrel make choice of such arm a might deprive him of this advantage and that wholly depend upon fortune and assurance that they might not attribute hi victory rather to hi skill in fence than hi valour when i be young gentleman avoid the reputation of good fencer a injurious to them and learn to fence with all imaginable privacy a a trade of subtlety derogate from true and natural valour butt tilting and barrier the feint of warlike fight be the exercise of our forefather this other exercise be so much the less noble a it only respect a private end that teach u to destroy one another against law and justice and that every way always produce very ill effect it be much more worthy and more become to exercise ourselves in thing that strengthen than that weaken our government and that tend to the public safety and common glory the consul publius rutilius be the first who teach the soldier to handle their arm with skill and join art with valour not for the rise of private quarrel but for war and the quarrel of the people of rome a popular and civil defence and besides the example of caesar who command hi men to shoot chiefly at the face of pompey soldier in the battle of pharsalia a thousand other commander have also bethink them to invent new form of weapon and new way of striking and defend accord a occasion should require but a philopoemen condemn wrestle wherein he excel because the preparatives that be therein employ be differ from those that appertain to military discipline to which alone he conceive men of honour ought wholly to apply themselves so it seem to me that this address to which we form our limb those writhings and motion young men be teach in this new school be not only of no use but rather contrary and hurtful to the practice of fight in battle and also our people commonly make use of particular weapon and peculiarly design for duel and i have see when it have be disapprove that a gentleman challenge to fight with rapier and poignard appear in the array of a manatarms and that another should take hi cloak instead of hi poignard it be worthy of consideration that laches in plato speaking of learn to fence after our manner say that he never know any great soldier come out of that school especially the master of it and indeed a to them our experience tell as much a to the rest we may at least conclude that they be quality of no relation or correspondence and in the education of the child of hi government plato interdict the art of boxing introduce by amycus and epeius and that of wrestling by antaeus and cercyo because they have another end than to render youth fit for the service of war and contribute nothing to it but i see that i have somewhat stray from my theme the emperor mauricius be advertise by dream and several prognostic that one phoca an obscure soldier should kill him question hi soninlaw philip who this phoca be and what be hi nature quality and manner and so soon a philip amongst other thing have tell him that he be cowardly and timorous the emperor immediately conclude then that he be a murderer and cruel what be it that make tyrant so sanguinary ti only the solicitude for their own safety and that their faint heart can furnish them with no other mean of secure themselves than in exterminate those who may hurt them even so much a woman for fear of a scratch the first cruelty be exercise for themselves thence spring the fear of a just revenge which afterwards produce a series of new cruelty to obliterate one another philip king of macedon who have so much to do with the people of rome agitate with the horror of so many murder commit by hi order and doubting of be able to keep himself secure from so many family at diver time mortally injured and offend by him resolve to seize all the child of those he have cause to be slay to despatch them daily one after another and so to establish hi own repose fine matter be never impertinent however place and therefore i who more consider the weight and utility of what i deliver than it order and connection need not fear in this place to bring in an excellent story though it be a little bytheby for when they be rich in their own native beauty and be able to justify themselves the least end of a hair will serve to draw them into my discourse amongst other condemn by philip have be one herodicus prince of thessaly he have moreover after him cause hi two sonsinlaw to be put to death each leave a son very young behind him theoxena and archo be their two widow theoxena though highly court to it could not be persuade to marry again archo marry poris the great man among the aenians and by him have a great many child whom she die leave at a very tender age theoxena move with a maternal charity towards her nephew that she might have them under her own eye and in her own protection marry poris when presently come a proclamation of the king edict this bravespirited mother suspect the cruelty of philip and afraid of the insolence of the soldier towards these charm and tender child be so bold a to declare hat she would rather kill them with her own hand than deliver them poris startle at this protestation promise her to steal them away and to transport them to athens and there commit them to the custody of some faithful friend of hi they take therefore the opportunity of an annual feast which be celebrate at aenia in honour of aeneas and thither they go have appear by day at the public ceremony and banquet they steal the night follow into a vessel lay ready for the purpose to escape away by sea the wind prove contrary and find themselves in the morning within sight of the land whence they have launch overnight and be pursue by the guard of the port poris perceive this labour all he could to make the mariner do their utmost to escape from the pursuer but theoxena frantic with affection and revenge in pursuance of her former resolution prepare both weapon and poison and expose them before them go to my child say she death be now the only mean of your defence and liberty and shall administer occasion to the god to exercise their sacred justice these sharp sword and these full cup will open you the way into it courage fear nothing and thou my son who art the eldest take this steel into thy hand that thou mayest the more bravely die the child have on one side so powerful a counsellor and the enemy at their throat on the other run all of them eagerly upon what be next to hand and half dead be throw into the sea theoxena proud of have so gloriously provide for the safety of her child clasp her arm with great affection about her husband neck let u my friend say she follow these boy and enjoy the same sepulchre they do and so have embrace they throw themselves headlong into the sea so that the ship be carry back without the owner into the harbour tyrant at once both to kill and to make their anger felt have employ their capacity to invent the most lingering death they will have their enemy despatch but not so fast that they may not have leisure to taste their vengeance and therein they be mightily perplex for if the torment they inflict be violent they be short if long they be not then so painful a they desire and thus plague themselves in choice of the great cruelty of this we have a thousand examples in antiquity and i know not whether we unawares do not retain some trace of this barbarity all that exceed a simple death appear to me absolute cruelty our justice can not expect that he whom the fear of die by be behead or hang will not restrain should be any more awed by the imagination of a languishing fire pincer or the wheel and i know not in the meantime whether we do not throw them into despair for in what condition can be the soul of a man expect fourandtwenty hour together to be break upon a wheel or after the old way nail to a cross josephus relate that in the time of the war the roman make in judaea happen to pass by where they have three day before crucified certain jew he amongst them know three of hi own friend and obtain the favour of have them take down of whom two he say die the third live a great while after chalcondylas a writer of good credit in the record he have leave behind him of thing that happen in hi time and near him tell u a of the most excessive torment of that the emperor mohammed very often practise of cut off men in the middle by the diaphragm with one blow of a scimitar whence it follow that they die a it be two death at once and both the one part say he and the other be see to stir and strive a great while after in very great torment i do not think there be any great suffering in this motion the torment that be the most dreadful to look on be not always the great to endure and i find those that other historian relate to have be practise by him upon the epirot lord be more horrid and cruel where they be condemn to be flay alive piecemeal after so malicious a manner that they continue fifteen day in that misery and these other two croesus have cause a gentleman the favourite of hi brother pantaleon to be seize carried him into a fuller shop where he cause him to be scratch and card with the card and comb belong to that trade till he die george sechel chief commander of the peasant of poland who commit so many mischief under the title of the crusade be defeat in battle and take bu the vayvode of transylvania be three day bound naked upon the rack expose to all sort of torment that any one could contrive against him during which time many other prisoner be kept fasting in the end he live and look on they make hi beloved brother lucat for whom alone he entreat take on himself the blame of all their evil action drink hi blood and cause twenty of hi most favoured captain to fee upon him tear hi flesh in piece with their teeth and swallow the morsel the remainder of hi body and hi bowel so soon a he be dead be boil and other of hi follower compel to eat them such a compare cato the censor with the young cato who kill himself compare two beautiful nature much resemble one another the first acquire hi reputation several way and excels in military exploit and the utility of hi public employment but the virtue of the young besides that it be blasphemy to compare any to it in vigour be much more pure and unblemished for who could absolve that of the censor from envy and ambition have dare to attack the honour of scipio a man in goodness and all other excellent quality infinitely beyond him or any other of hi time that which they report of him amongst other thing that in hi extreme old age he put himself upon learn the greek tongue with so greedy an appetite a if to quench a long thirst do not seem to me to make much for hi honour it be properly what we call fall into second childhood all thing have their season even good one and i may say my paternoster out of time a they accuse t quintus flaminius that be general of an army he be see pray apart in the time of a battle that he win eudemonidas see xenocrates when very old still very intent upon hi school lecture when will this man be wise say he if he be yet learning and philopaemen to those who extol king ptolemy for every day inure hi person to the exercise of arm it be not say he commendable in a king of hi age to exercise himself in these thing he ought now really to employ them the young be to make their preparation the old to enjoy them say the sage and the great vice they observe in u be that our desire incessantly grow young again we be always rebeginning to live our study and desire should sometime be sensible of age yet we have one foot in the grave and still our appetite and pursuit spring every day anew within u the long of my design be not of above a year extent i think of nothing now but end rid myself of all new hope and enterprise take my last leave of every place i depart from and every day dispossess myself of what i have ti indeed the only comfort i find in my old age that it mortify in me several care and desire wherewith my life have be disturb the care how the world go the care of rich of grandeur of knowledge of health of myself there be men who be learn to speak at a time when they should learn to be silent for ever a man may always study but he must not always go to school what a contemptible thing be an old abecedarian if we must study let u study what be suitable to our present condition that we may answer a he do who be ask to what end he study in hi decrepit age that i may go out well say he and at great ease such a study be that of the young cato feel hi end approach and which he meet with in plato discourse of the eternity of the soul not a we be to believe that he be not long before furnish with all sort of provision for such a departure for of assurance an establish will and instruction he have more than plato have in all hi writing hi knowledge and courage be in this respect above philosophy he apply himself to this study not for the service of hi death but a a man whose sleep be never disturb in the importance of such a deliberation he also without choice or change continue hi study with the other accustomary action of hi life the night that he be deny the praetorship he spend in play that wherein he be to die he spend in read the loss either of life or of office be all one to him i find by experience that there be a good deal to be say betwixt the flight and emotion of the soul or a resolute and constant habit and very well perceive that there be nothing we may not do nay even to the surpass the divinity itself say a certain person forasmuch a it be more to render a man self impassible by hi own study and industry than to be so by hi natural condition and even to be able to conjoin to man imbecility and frailty a godlike resolution and assurance but it be by fit and start and in the life of those hero of time past there be sometimes miraculous impulse and that seem infinitely to exceed our natural force but they be indeed only impulse and tis hard to believe that these so elevated quality in a man can so thoroughly tinct and imbue the soul that they should become ordinary and a it be natural in him it accidentally happen even to u who be but abortive birth of men sometimes to launch our soul when rouse by the discourse or example of other much beyond their ordinary stretch but tis a kind of passion which push and agitate them and in some sort ravishes them from themselves but this perturbation once overcome we see that they insensibly flag and slacken of themselves if not to the low degree at least so a to be no more the same insomuch a that upon every trivial occasion the losing of a bird or the breaking of a glass we suffer ourselves to be move little less than one of the common people i be of opinion that order moderation and constancy except all thing be to be do by a man that be very imperfect and defective in general therefore it be say the sage that to make a right judgment of a man you be chiefly to pry into hi common action and surprise him in hi everyday habit pyrrho he who erect so pleasant a knowledge upon ignorance endeavour a all the rest who be really philosopher do to make hi life correspond with hi doctrine and because he maintain the imbecility of human judgment to be so extreme a to be incapable of any choice or inclination and would have it perpetually waver and suspend consider and receive all thing a indifferent ti say that he always comfort himself after the same manner and countenance if he have begin a discourse he would always end what he have to say though the person he be speak to have go away if he walk he never stop for any impediment that stand in hi way be preserve from precipice collision with cart and other like accident by the care of hi friend for to fear or to avoid anything have be to shock hi own proposition which deprive the sens themselves of all election and certainty sometimes he suffer incision and cautery with so great constancy a never to be see so much a to wince ti something to bring the soul to these imagination tis more to join the effect and yet not impossible but to conjoin them with such perseverance and constancy a to make them habitual be certainly in attempt so remote from the common usage almost incredible to be do therefore it be that be sometime take in hi house sharply scold with hi sister and be reproach that he therein transgress hi own rule of indifference what say he must this bit of a woman also serve for a testimony to my rule another time be see to defend himself against a dog it be say he very hard totally to put off man and we must endeavour and force ourselves to resist and encounter thing first by effect but at least by reason and argument about seven or eight year since a husbandman yet live but two league from my house have long be torment with hi wife jealousy come one day home from hi work and she welcome him with her accustomed railing enter into so great fury that with a sickle he have yet in hi hand he totally cut off all those part that she be jealous of and throw them in her face and ti say that a young gentleman of our nation brisk and amorous have by hi perseverance at last mollify the heart of a fair mistress enrage that upon the point of fruition he find himself unable to perform and that as soon a ever he come home he deprive himself of the rebellious member and send it to hi mistress a cruel and bloody victim for the expiation of hi offence if this have be do upon mature consideration and upon the account of religion a the priest of cybele do what should we say of so high an action a few day since at bergerac five league from my house up the river dordogne a woman have overnight be beat and abuse by her husband a choleric illconditioned fellow resolve to escape from hi illusage at the price of her life and go so soon a she be up the next morning to visit her neighbour a she be wont to do and have let some word fall in recommendation of her affair she take a sister of hers by the hand and lead her to the bridge whither be come and have take leave of her in jest a it be without any manner of alteration in her countenance she throw herself headlong from the top into the river and be there drown that which be the most remarkable in this be that this resolution be a whole night forming in her head it be quite another thing with the indian woman for it be the custom there for the men to have many wife and the best beloved of them to kill herself at her husband decease every one of them make it the business of her whole life to obtain this privilege and gain this advantage over her companion and the good office they do their husband aim at no other recompense but to be prefer in accompany him in death a certain author of our time report that he have see in those oriental nation this custom in practice that not only the wife bury themselves with their husband but even the slave he have enjoy also which be do after this manner the husband be dead the widow may if she will but few will demand two or three month respite wherein to order her affair the day be come she mount on horseback dress as fine a at her wedding and with a cheerful countenance say she be go to sleep with her spouse hold a lookingglass in her left hand and an arrow in the other being thus conduct in pomp accompany with her kindred and friend and a great concourse of people in great joy she be at last brought to the public place appoint for such spectacle this be a great space in the midst of which be a pit full of wood and adjoin to it a mount raise four or five step upon which she be bring and serve with a magnificent repast which be do she fall to dance and sing and give order when she think fit to kindle the fire this be do she descend and take the near of her husband relation by the hand they walk to the river close by where she strip herself stark naked and have distribute her clothes and jewel to her friend plunge herself into the water a if there to cleanse herself from her sin come out thence she wrap herself in a yellow linen of fiveandtwenty ell long and again give her hand to this kinsman of her husband they return back to the mount where she make a speech to the people and recommend her child to them if she have any betwixt the pit and the mount there be commonly a curtain drawn to screen the burn furnace from their sight which some of them to manifest the great courage forbid having end what she have to say a woman present her with a vessel of oil wherewith to anoint her head and her whole body which when do with she throw into the fire and in an instant precipitate herself after immediately the people throw a good many billet and log upon her that she may not be long in die and convert all their joy into sorrow and mourn if they be person of meaner condition the body of the defunct be carry to the place of sepulture and there place sit the widow kneel before him embrace the dead body and they continue in this posture whilst the people build a wall about them which so soon a it be raise to the height of the woman shoulder one of her relation come behind her and take hold of her head twist her neck so soon a she be dead the wall be presently raise up and close and there they remain entombed there be in this same country something like this in their gymnosophist for not by constraint of other nor by the impetuosity of a sudden humour but by the express profession of their order their custom be as soon a they arrive at a certain age or that they saw themselves threaten by any disease to cause a funeral pile to be erect for them and on the top a stately bed where after have joyfully feast their friend and acquaintance they lay them down with so great resolution that fire be apply to it they be never see to stir either hand or foot and after this manner one of them calanus by name expire in the presence of the whole army of alexander the great and he be neither reputed holy nor happy amongst them who do not thus destroy himself dismiss hi soul purge and purify by the fire after have consume all that be earthly and mortal this constant premeditation of the whole life be that which make the wonder amongst our other controversy that of fatum have also creep in and to tie thing to come and even our own will to a certain and inevitable necessity we be yet upon this argument of time past since god foresee that all thing shall so fall out a doubtless he do it must then necessarily follow that they must so fall out to which our master reply that the see anything come to pass a we do and a god himself also do for all thing be present with him he rather see than foresees be not to compel an event that be we see because thing do fall out but thing do not fall out because we see event cause knowledge but knowledge do not cause event that which we see happen do happen but it might have happen otherwise and god in the catalogue of the cause of event which he have in hi prescience have also those which we call accidental and voluntary depend upon the liberty he have give our free will and know that we do amiss because we would do so i have see a great many commander encourage their soldier with this fatal necessity for if our time be limit to a certain hour neither the enemy shoot nor our own boldness nor our flight and cowardice can either shorten or prolong our life this be easily say but see who will be so easily persuade and if it be so that a strong and lively faith draw along with it action of the same kind certainly this faith we so much brag of be very light in this age of ours unless the contempt it have of work make it disdain their company so it be that to this very purpose the sire de joinville a credible a witness a any other whatever tell u of the bedouin a nation amongst the saracen with whom the king st louis have to do in the holy land that they in their religion so firmly believe the number of every man day to be from all eternity prefix and set down by an inevitable decree that they go naked to the war except a turkish sword and their body only cover with a white linen cloth and for the great curse they could invent when they be angry this be always in their mouth accurse be thou a he that arm himself for fear of death this be a testimony of faith very much beyond ours and of this sort be that also that two friar of florence give in our father day be engage in some controversy of learn they agree to go both of them into the fire in the sight of all the people each for the verification of hi argument and all thing be already prepared and the thing just upon the point of execution when it be interrupt by an unexpected accident a young turkish lord have perform a notable exploit in hi own person in the sight of both army that of amurath and that of huniades ready to join battle be ask by amurath what in such tender and inexperienced year for it be hi first sally into arm have inspire him with so brave a courage reply that hi chief tutor for valour be a hare for be say he one day a hunting i find a hare sit and though i have a brace of excellent greyhound with me yet methought it would be best for sureness to make use of my bow for she sit very fair i then fell to let fly my arrow and shot forty that i have in my quiver not only without hurt but without start her from her form at last i slip my dog after her but to no more purpose than i have shoot by which i understand that she have be secure by her destiny and that neither dart nor sword can wind without the permission of fate which we can neither hasten nor defer this story may serve by the way to let u see how flexible our reason be to all sort of image a person of great year name dignity and learning boast to me that he have be induce to a certain very important change in hi faith by a strange and whimsical incitation and one otherwise so inadequate that i think it much strong take the contrary way he call it a miracle and so i look upon it but in a different sense the turkish historian say that the persuasion those of their nation have imprint in them of the fatal and unalterable prescription of their day manifestly conduces to the give them great assurance in danger and i know a great prince who make very fortunate use of it whether it be that he really believe it or that he make it hi excuse for so wonderfully hazard himself let u hope fortune may not be too soon weary of her favour to him there have not happen in our memory a more admirable effect of resolution than in those two who conspire the death of the prince of orange ti marvellous how the second who execute it could ever be persuade into an attempt wherein hi companion who have do hi utmost have have so ill success and after the same method and with the same arm to go attack a lord arm with so recent a late lesson of distrust powerful in follower and bodily strength in hi own hall amidst hi guard and in a city wholly at hi devotion assuredly he employ a very resolute arm and a courage enflamed with furious passion a poignard be sure for striking home but by reason that more motion and force of hand be require than with a pistol the blow be more subject to be put by or hinder that this man do not run to a certain death i make no great doubt for the hope any one could flatter him withal could not find place in any sober understanding and the conduct of hi exploit sufficiently manifest that he have no want of that no more than of courage the motif of so powerful a persuasion may be diverse for our fancy do what it will both with itself and u the execution that be do near orleans be nothing like this there be in this more of chance than vigour the wound be not mortal if fortune have not make it so and to attempt to shoot on horseback and at a great distance by one whose body be in motion from the motion of hi horse be the attempt of a man who have rather miss hi blow than fail of save himself this be apparent from what follow for he be so astonished and stupefy with the thought of so high an execution that he totally lose hi judgment both to find hi way to flight and to govern hi tongue what need he to have do more than to fly back to hi friend across the river ti what i have do in less danger and that i think of very little hazard how broad soever the river may be provide your horse have easy go in and that you see on the other side easy land accord to the stream the other when they pronounce hi dreadful sentence i be prepare for this say he beforehand and i will make you wonder at my patience the assassin a nation border upon phoenicia be repute amongst the mohammedan a people of very great devotion and purity of manner they hold that the near way to gain paradise be to kill some one of a contrary religion which be the reason they have often be see be but one or two and without armour to attempt against powerful enemy at the price of a certain death and without any consideration of their own danger so be our raymond count of tripoli assassinate which word be derive from their name in the heart of hi city during our enterprise of the holy war and likewise conrad marquis of monteferrat the murderer at their execution bear themselves with great pride and glory that they have perform so brave an exploit this story shall go by itself for i will leave it to physicians to discourse of two day ago i saw a child that two men and a nurse who say they be the father the uncle and the aunt of it carry about to get money by show it by reason it be so strange a creature it be a to all the rest of a common form and could stand upon it foot could go and gabble much like other child of the same age it have never a yet take any other nourishment but from the nurse breast and what in my presence they try to put into the mouth of it it only chew a little and spat it out again without swallow the cry of it seem indeed a little odd and particular and it be just fourteen month old under the breast it be join to another child but without a head and which have the spine of the back without motion the rest entire for though it have one arm shorter than the other it have be break by accident at their birth they be join breast to breast and a if a less child seek to throw it arm about the neck of one something big the juncture and thickness of the place where they be conjoin be not above four finger or thereabouts so that if you thrust up the imperfect child you might see the navel of the other below it and the joining be betwixt the pap and the navel the navel of the imperfect child could not be see but all the rest of the belly so that all that be not join of the imperfect one a arm buttock thigh and leg hang dangle upon the other and might reach to the midleg the nurse moreover tell u that it urined at both body and that the member of the other be nourish sensible and in the same plight with that she give suck to except that they be short and less this double body and several limb relate to one head might be interpret a favourable prognostic to the king of maintain these various part of our state under the union of hi law but l the event should prove otherwise ti well to let it alone for in thing already past there need no divination a ti say of epimenides that he always prophesy backward i have just see a herdsman in medoc of about thirty year of age who have no sign of any genital part he have three hole by which he incessantly void hi water he be beard have desire and seek contact with woman those that we call monster be not so to god who see in the immensity of hi work the infinite form that he have comprehend therein and it be to be believe that this figure which astonish u have relation to some other figure of the same kind unknown to man from hi all wisdom nothing but good common and regular proceeds but we do not discern the disposition and relation whatever fall out contrary to custom we say be contrary to nature but nothing whatever it be be contrary to her let therefore this universal and natural reason expel the error and astonishment that novelty brings along with it plutarch be admirable throughout but especially where he judge of human action what fine thing do he say in the comparison of lycurgus and numa upon the subject of our great folly in abandon child to the care and government of their father the most of our civil government a aristotle say leave after the manner of the cyclops to every one the ordering of their wife and child accord to their own foolish and indiscreet fancy and the lacedaemonian and cretan be almost the only government that have commit the education of child to the law who do not see that in a state all depend upon their nurture and bring up and yet they be leave to the mercy of parent let them be a foolish and illconditioned a they may without any manner of discretion amongst other thing how often have i a i have pass along our street have a good mind to get up a farce to revenge the poor boy whom i have see hide knock down and miserably beat by some father or mother when in their fury and mad with rage you shall see them come out with fire and fury sparkling in their eye and accord to hippocrates the most dangerous malady be they that disfigure the countenance with a roaring and terrible voice very often against those that be but newly come from nurse and there they be lam and spoil with blow whilst our justice take no cognisance of it a if these maims and dislocation be not execute upon member of our commonwealth there be no passion that so much transport men from their right judgment a anger no one would demur upon punish a judge with death who should condemn a criminal on the account of hi own choler why then should father and pedagogue be any more allowed to whip and chastise child in their anger ti then no longer correction but revenge chastisement be instead of physic to child and would we endure a physician who should be animate against and enrage at hi patient we ourselves to do well should never lay a hand upon our servant whilst our anger last when the pulse beat and we feel emotion in ourselves let u defer the business thing will indeed appear otherwise to u when we be calm and cool ti passion that then command tis passion that speaks and not we fault see through passion appear much great to u than they really be a body do when see through a mist he who be hungry us meat but he who will make use of chastisement should have neither hunger nor thirst to it and moreover chastisement that be inflict with weight and discretion be much good receive and with great benefit by him who suffer otherwise he will not think himself justly condemn by a man transport with anger and fury and will allege hi master excessive passion hi inflamed countenance hi unwonted oath hi emotion and precipitous rashness for hi own justification suetonius report that caius rabirius have be condemn by caesar the thing that most prevail upon the people to whom he have appeal to determine the cause in hi favour be the animosity and vehemence that caesar have manifest in that sentence saying be a different thing from do we be to consider the sermon apart and the preacher apart these men lend themselves to a pretty business who in our time have attempt to shake the truth of our church by the vice of her minister she extract her testimony elsewhere tis a foolish way of argue and that would throw all thing into confusion a man whose moral be good may have false opinion and a wicked man may preach truth even though he believe it not himself ti doubtless a fine harmony when do and say go together and i will not deny but that say when the action follow be not of great authority and efficacy a eudamidas say hear a philosopher talk of military affair these thing be finely say but he who speak them be not to be believe for hi ear have never be use to the sound of the trumpet and cleomenes hear an orator declaim upon valour burst out into laughter at which the other be angry i should say he to him do the same if it be a swallow that speak of this subject but if it be an eagle i should willingly hear him i perceive methinks in the writing of the ancient that he who speak what he think strike much more home than he who only feign hear cicero speak of the love of liberty hear brutus speak of it the mere write word of this man sound a if he would purchase it at the price of hi life let cicero the father of eloquence treat of the contempt of death let seneca do the same the first languishingly drawl it out so you perceive he would make you resolve upon a thing on which he be not resolve himself he inspire you not with courage for he himself have none the other animates and inflames you i never read an author even of those who treat of virtue and of action that i do not curiously inquire what kind of a man he be himself for the ephori at sparta see a dissolute fellow propose a wholesome advice to the people command him to hold hi peace and entreat a virtuous man to attribute to himself the invention and to propose it plutarch writing if well understand sufficiently bespeak their author and so that i think i know him even into hi soul and yet i could wish that we have some fuller account of hi life and i be thus far wander from my subject upon the account of the obligation i have to aulus gellius for have leave u in write this story of hi manner that bring me back to my subject of anger a slave of hi a vicious illconditioned fellow but who have the precept of philosophy often ring in hi ear have for some offence of hi be stript by plutarch command whilst he be be whip mutter at first that it be without cause and that he have do nothing to deserve it but at last fall in good earnest to exclaim against and rail at hi master he reproach him that he be no philosopher a he have boast himself to be that he have often hear him say it be indecent to be angry nay have write a book to that purpose and that the cause him to be so cruelly beat in the height of hi rage totally give the lie to all hi writing to which plutarch calmly and coldly answer how ruffian say he by what dost thou judge that i be now angry doe either my face my colour or my voice give any manifestation of my be move i do not think my eye look fierce that my countenance appear troubled or that my voice be dreadful be i red do i foam do any word escape my lip i ought to repent do i start do i tremble with fury for those i tell thee be the true sign of anger and so turn to the fellow that be whip him ply on thy work say he whilst this gentleman and i dispute this be hi story archytas tarentinus return from a war wherein he have be captaingeneral find all thing in hi house in very great disorder and hi land quite out of tillage through the ill husbandry of hi receiver and have cause him to be call to him go say he if i be not in anger i would soundly drub your side plato likewise be highly offend with one of hi slave give speusippus order to chastise him excuse himself from do it because he be in anger and carillus a lacedaemonian to a helot who carry himself insolently towards him by the god say he if i be not angry i would immediately cause thee to be put to death ti a passion that be please with and flatters itself how often be move under a false cause if the person offend make a good defence and present u with a just excuse be we angry against truth and innocence itself in proof of which i remember a marvellous example of antiquity piso otherwise a man of very eminent virtue be move against a soldier of hi for that return alone from forage he could give him no account where he have leave a companion of hi take it for grant that he have kill him and presently condemn him to death he be no sooner mount upon the gibbet but behold hi wander companion arrives at which all the army be exceedingly glad and after many embrace of the two comrade the hangman carry both the one and the other into pisos presence all those present believe it would be a great pleasure even to himself but it prove quite contrary for through shame and spite hi fury which be not yet cool redouble and by a subtlety which hi passion suddenly suggest to him he make three criminal for have find one innocent and cause them all to be despatch the first soldier because sentence have pass upon him the second who have lose hi way because he be the cause of hi companion death and the hangman for not have obey the order which have be give him such a have have to do with testy and obstinate woman may have experiment into what a rage it put them to oppose silence and coldness to their fury and that a man disdain to nourish their anger the orator celius be wonderfully choleric by nature and to one who sup in hi company a man of a gentle and sweet conversation and who that he might not move him approved and consent to all he say he impatient that hi illhumour should thus spend itself without aliment for the love of the god deny me something say he that we may be two woman in like manner be only angry that other may be angry again in imitation of the law of love phocion to one who interrupt hi speaking by injurious and very opprobrious word make no other return than silence and to give him full liberty and leisure to vent hi spleen which he have accordingly do and the storm blown over without any mention of this disturbance he proceed in hi discourse where he have leave off before no answer can nettle a man like such a contempt of the most choleric man in france anger be always an imperfection but more excusable in a soldier for in that trade it can not sometimes be avoid i often say that he be the most patient man that i know and the most discreet in bridle hi passion which rise in him with so great violence and fury that he must of necessity cruelly constrain himself to moderate it and for my part i know no passion which i could with so much violence to myself attempt to cover and conceal i would not set wisdom at so high a price and do not so much consider what a man do a how much it cost him to do no worse another boast himself to me of the regularity and gentleness of hi manner which be to truth very singular to whom i reply that it be indeed something especially m person of so eminent a quality a himself upon whom every one have their eye to present himself always welltempered to the world but that the principal thing be to make provision for within and for himself and that it be not in my opinion very well to order hi business outwardly well and to grate himself within which i be afraid he do in put on and maintain this mask and external appearance a man incorporate anger by conceal it a diogenes tell demosthenes who for fear of be see in a tavern withdrew himself the more retiredly into it the more you retire backward the farther you enter in i would rather advise that a man should give hi servant a box of the ear a little unseasonably than rack hi fancy to present this grave and compose countenance and have rather discover my passion than brood over them at my own expense they grow less inventing and manifest themselves and tis much good their point should wind other without than be turned towards ourselves within i admonish all those who have authority to be angry in my family in the first place to manage their anger and not to lavish it upon every occasion for that both lessen the value and hinder the effect rash and incessant scolding run into custom and render itself despise and what you lay out upon a servant for a theft be not felt because it be the same he have see you a hundred time employ against him for have ill wash a glass or set a stool out of place secondly that they be not angry to no purpose but make sure that their reprehension reach him with whom they be offend for ordinarily they rail and bawl before he come into their presence and continue scold an age after he be go they attack hi shadow and drive the storm in a place where no one be either chastised or concerned but in the clamour of their voice i likewise in quarrel condemn those who huff and vapour without an enemy those rhodomontade should be reserve to discharge upon the offend party when i be angry my anger be very sharp but withal very short and as private a i can i lose myself indeed in promptness and violence but not in trouble so that i throw out all sort of injurious word at random and without choice and never consider pertinently to dart my language where i think it will deepest wound for i commonly make use of no other weapon than my tongue my servant have a good bargain of me in great occasion than in little the little one surprise me and the misfortune be that when you be once upon the precipice ti no matter who give you the push you always go to the bottom the fall urge move and make haste of itself in great occasion this satisfies me that they be so just every one expect a reasonable indignation and then i glorify myself in deceive their expectation against these i fortify and prepare myself they disturb my head and threaten to transport me very far should i follow them i can easily contain myself from enter into one of these passion and be strong enough when i expect them to repel their violence be the cause never so great but if a passion once prepossess and seize me it carry me away be the cause never so small i bargain thus with those who may contend with me when you see me move first let me alone right or wrong ill do the same for you the storm be only beget by a concurrence of anger which easily spring from one another and be not bear together let every one have hi own way and we shall be always at peace a profitable advice but hard to execute sometimes also it fall out that i put on a seeming anger for the good governing of my house without any real emotion a age render my humour more sharp i study to oppose them and will if i can order it so that for the future i may be so much the less peevish and hard to please a i have more excuse and inclination to be so although i have heretofore be reckon amongst those who have the great patience a word more to conclude this argument aristotle say that anger sometimes serve for arm to virtue and valour that be probable nevertheless they who contradict him pleasantly answer that ti a weapon of novel use for we move all other arm this move u our hand guide it not tis it that guide our hand it hold u we hold not it the familiarity i have with these two author and the assistance they have lend to my age and to my book wholly compile of what i have borrow from them oblige me to stand up for their honour a to seneca amongst a million of little pamphlet that those of the socalled reform religion disperse abroad for the defence of their cause and which sometimes proceed from so good a hand that ti pity hi pen be not employ in a good subject i have formerly see one that to make up the parallel he would fain find out betwixt the government of our late poor king charles ix and that of nero compare the late cardinal of lorraine with seneca their fortune in have both of them be the prime minister in the government of their prince and in their manner condition and deportment to have be very near alike wherein in my opinion he do the say cardinal a very great honour for though i be one of those who have a very high esteem for hi wit eloquence and zeal to religion and the service of hi king and hi good fortune to have live in an age wherein it be so novel so rare and also so necessary for the public good to have an ecclesiastical person of such high birth and dignity and so sufficient and capable of hi place yet to confess the truth i do not think hi capacity by many degree near to the other nor hi virtue either so clean entire or steady a that of seneca now the book whereof i speak to bring about it design give a very injurious description of seneca have borrow it approach from dion the historian whose testimony i do not at all believe for besides that he be inconsistent that after have call seneca one while very wise and again a mortal enemy to nero vice make him elsewhere avaricious an usurer ambitious effeminate voluptuous and a false pretender to philosophy hi virtue appear so vivid and vigorous in hi writing and hi vindication be so clear from any of these imputation a of hi rich and extraordinarily expensive way of living that i can not believe any testimony to the contrary and besides it be much more reasonable to believe the roman historian in such thing than greek and foreigner now tacitus and the rest speak very honourably both of hi life and death and represent him to u a very excellent and virtuous person in all thing and i will allege no other reproach against dions report but this which i can not avoid namely that he have so weak a judgment in the roman affair that he dare to maintain julius caesar cause against pompey and that of antony against cicero let u now come to plutarch jean bodin be a good author of our time and a writer of much great judgment than the rout of scribbler of hi age and who deserve to be read and consider i find him though a little bold in this passage of hi method of history where he accuse plutarch not only of ignorance wherein i would have let him alone for that be beyond my criticism but that he often write thing incredible and absolutely fabulous these be hi own word if he have simply say that he have deliver thing otherwise than they really be it have be no great reproach for what we have not see we be force to receive from other hand and take upon trust and i see that he purposely sometimes variously relate the same story a the judgment of the three best captain that ever be give by hannibal ti one way in the life of flammius and another in that of pyrrhus but to charge him with have take incredible and impossible thing for current pay be to accuse the most judicious author in the world of want of judgment and this be hi example a say he when he relate that a lacedaemonian boy suffer hi bowel to be tear out by a foxcub he have steal and keep it still conceal under hi coat till he fell down dead rather than he would discover hi theft i find in the first place this example ill choose forasmuch a it be very hard to limit the power of the faculty of the soul whereas we have good authority to limit and know the force of the bodily limb and therefore if i have be he i should rather have choose an example of this second sort and there be some of these less credible and amongst other that which he refates of pyrrhus that all wound a he be he strike one of hi enemy who be arm from head to foot so great a blow with hi sword that he clave him down from hi crown to hi seat so that the body be divide into two part in this example i find no great miracle nor do i admit the excuse with which he defend plutarch in have add these word a ti say to suspend our belief for unless it be in thing receive by authority and the reverence to antiquity or religion he would never have himself admit or enjoin u to believe thing incredible in themselves and that these word a ti say be not put in this place to that effect be easy to be see because he elsewhere relate to u upon this subject of the patience of the lacedaemonian child examples happen in hi time more unlikely to prevail upon our faith a what cicero have also testify before him as have a he say be upon the spot that even to their time there be child find who in the trial of patience they be put to before the altar of diana suffer themselves to be there whip till the blood run down all over their body not only without cry out but without so much a a groan and some till they there voluntarily lose their life and that which plutarch also amongst a hundred other witness relate that at a sacrifice a burning coal have fall into the sleeve of a lacedaemonian boy a he be cense he suffer hi whole arm to be burn till the smell of the broiling flesh be perceive by those present there be nothing accord to their custom wherein their reputation be more concerned nor for which they be to undergo more blame and disgrace than in be take in theft i be so fully satisfy of the greatness of those people that this story do not only not appear to me a to bodin incredible but i do not find it so much a rare and strange the spartan history be full of a thousand more cruel and rare example and be indeed all miracle in this respect marcellinus concern theft report that in hi time there be no sort of torment which could compel the egyptian when take in this act though a people very much addict to it so much a to tell their name a spanish peasant be put to the rack a to the accomplice of the murder of the praetor lucius piso cry out in the height of the torment that hi friend should not leave him but look on in all assurance and that no pain have the power to force from him one word of confession which be all they could get the first day the next day a they be lead him a second time to another trial strongly disengage himself from the hand of hi guard he furiously run hi head against a wall and beat out hi brain epicharis have tire and glut the cruelty of nero satellite and undergo their fire their beat their rack a whole day together without one syllable of confession of her conspiracy be the next day bring again to the rack with her limb almost tear to piece convey the lace of her robe with a run noose over one of the arm of her chair and suddenly slip her head into it with the weight of her own body hang herself have the courage to die in that manner be it not to be presume that she purposely lend her life to the trial of her fortitude the day before to mock the tyrant and encourage other to the like attempt and whoever will inquire of our trooper the experience they have have in our civil war will find effect of patience and obstinate resolution in this miserable age of ours and amongst this rabble even more effeminate than the egyptian worthy to be compare with those we have just relate of the spartan virtue i know there have be simple peasant amongst u who have endure the sol of their foot to be broil upon a gridiron their fingerends to be crush with the cock of a pistol and their bloody eye squeeze out of their head by force of a cord twist about their brow before they would so much a consent to a ransom i have see one leave stark naked for dead in a ditch hi neck black and swollen with a halter yet about it with which they have drag him all night at a horse tail hi body wound in a hundred place with stab of dagger that have be give him not to kill him but to put him to pain and to affright him who have endure all this and even to be speechless and insensible resolve a he himself tell me rather to die a thousand death as indeed a to matter of suffer he have borne one before he would promise anything and yet he be one of the rich husbandman of all the country how many have be see patiently to suffer themselves to be burnt and roast for opinion take upon trust from other and by them not at all understood i have know a hundred and a hundred woman for gascony have a certain prerogative for obstinacy whom you might sooner have make eat fire than forsake an opinion they have conceive in anger they be all the more exasperated by blow and constraint and he that make the story of the woman who in defiance of all correction threat and bastinado cease not to call her husband lousy knave and who be plunge over head and ear in water yet lift her hand above her head and make a sign of crack louse feign a tale of which in truth we every day see a manifest image in the obstinacy of woman and obstinacy be the sister of constancy at least in vigour and stability we be not to judge what be possible and what be not accord to what be credible and incredible to our apprehension a i have say elsewhere and it be a great fault and yet one that most men be guilty of which nevertheless i do not mention with any reflection upon bodin to make a difficulty of believe that in another which they could not or would not do themselves every one think that the sovereign stamp of human nature be imprint in him and that from it all other must take their rule and that all proceeding which be not like hi be feign and false is anything of anothers action or faculty propose to him the first thing he call to the consultation of hi judgment be hi own example and a matter go with him so they must of necessity do with all the world besides dangerous and intolerable folly for my part i consider some men a infinitely beyond me especially amongst the ancient and yet though i clearly discern my inability to come near them by a thousand pace i do not forbear to keep them in sight and to judge of what so elevate them of which i perceive some seed in myself a i also do of the extreme meanness of some other mind which i neither be astonish at nor yet misbelieve i very well perceive the turn those great soul take to raise themselves to such a pitch and admire their grandeur and those flight that i think the brave i could be glad to imitate where though i want wing yet my judgment readily go along with them the other example he introduce of thing incredible and wholly fabulous deliver by plutarch be that agesilaus be fin by the ephori for have wholly engross the heart and affection of hi citizen to himself alone and herein i do not see what sign of falsity be to be find clearly plutarch speaks of thing that must needs be good know to him than to u and it be no new thing in greece to see men punish and exile for this very thing for be too acceptable to the people witness the ostracism and petal there be yet in this place another accusation lay against plutarch which i can not well digest where bodin say that he have sincerely parallel roman with roman and greek amongst themselves but not roman with greek witness say he demosthenes and cicero cato and aristides sylla and lysander marcellus and pelopidas pompey and agesilaus hold that he have favour the greek in give them so unequal companion this be really to attack what in plutarch be most excellent and most to be commend for in hi parallel which be the most admirable part of all hi work and with which in my opinion he be himself the most pleased the fidelity and sincerity of hi judgment equal their depth and weight he be a philosopher who teach u virtue let u see whether we can not defend him from this reproach of falsity and prevarication all that i can imagine could give occasion to this censure be the great and shin lustre of the roman name which we have in our mind it do not seem likely to u that demosthenes could rival the glory of a consul proconsul and proctor of that great republic but if a man consider the truth of the thing and the men in themselves which be plutarch chiefest aim and will rather balance their manner their nature and part than their fortune i think contrary to bodin that cicero and the elder cato come far short of the men with whom they be compare i should sooner for hi purpose have choose the example of the young cato compare with phocion for in this couple there would have be a more likely disparity to the roman advantage a to marcellus sylla and pompey i very well discern that their exploit of war be great and more full of pomp and glory than those of the greek whom plutarch compare with them but the brave and most virtuous action any more in war than elsewhere be not always the most renowned i often see the name of captain obscure by the splendour of other name of less desert witness labienus ventidius telesinus and several other and to take it by that be i to complain on the behalf of the greek could i not say that camillus be much less comparable to themistocles the gracchi to agis and cleomenes and numa to lycurgus but tis folly to judge at one view of thing that have so many aspect when plutarch compare them he do not for all that make them equal who could more learnedly and sincerely have mark their distinction do he parallel the victory feat of arm the force of the army conduct by pompey and hi triumph with those of agesilaus i do not believe say he that xenophon himself if he be now live though he be allow to write whatever pleased him to the advantage of agesilaus would dare to bring them into comparison doe he speak of parallel lysander to sylla there be say he no comparison either in the number of victory or in the hazard of battle for lysander only gain two naval battle this be not to derogate from the roman for have only simply name them with the greek he can have do them no injury what disparity soever there may be betwixt them and plutarch do not entirely oppose them to one another there be no preference in general he only compare the piece and circumstance one after another and give of every one a particular and separate judgment wherefore if any one could convict him of partiality he ought to pick out some one of those particular judgment or say in general that he be mistake in compare such a greek to such a roman when there be other more fit and well resemble to parallel him to philosophy think she have not ill employ her talent when she have give the sovereignty of the soul and the authority of restrain our appetite to reason amongst which they who judge that there be none more violent than those which spring from love have this opinion also that they seize both body and soul and possess the whole man so that even health itself depend upon them and medicine be sometimes constrain to pimp for them but one might on the contrary also say that the mixture of the body bring an abatement and weaken for such desire be subject to satiety and capable of material remedy many be determine to rid their soul from the continual alarm of this appetite have make use of incision and amputation of the rebel member other have subdue their force and ardour by the frequent application of cold thing a snow and vinegar the sackcloth of our ancestor be for this purpose which be cloth woven of horse hair of which some of them make shirt and other girdle to torture and correct their rein a prince not long ago tell me that in hi youth upon a solemn festival in the court of king francis i where everybody be finely dress he would need put on hi father hair shirt which be still keep in the house but how great soever hi devotion be he have not patience to wear it till night and be sick a long time after add withal that he do not think there could be any youthful heat so fierce that the use of this recipe would not mortify and yet perhaps he never essay the most violent for experience show u that such emotion be often see under rude and slovenly clothes and that a hair shirt do not always render those chaste who wear it xenocrates proceed with great rigour in this affair for hi disciple to make trial of hi continency have slipt lais that beautiful and famous courtesan into hi bed quite naked except the arm of her beauty and her wanton allurements her philter find that in despite of hi reason and philosophical rule hi unruly flesh begin to mutiny he cause those member of hi to be burn that he find consent to this rebellion whereas the passion which wholly reside in the soul a ambition avarice and the rest find the reason much more to do because it can not there be help but by it own mean neither be those appetite capable of satiety but grow sharper and increase by fruition the sole example of julius caesar may suffice to demonstrate to u the disparity of these appetite for never be man more addicted to amorous delight than he of which one testimony be the peculiar care he have of hi person to such a degree a to make use of the most lascivious mean to that end then in use a to have all the hair of hi body twitch off and to wipe all over with perfume with the extreme nicety and he be a beautiful person in himself of a fair complexion tall and sprightly full face with quick hazel eye if we may believe suetonius for the statue of him that we see at rome do not in all point answer this description besides hi wife whom he four time change without reckon the amour of hi boyhood with nicomedes king of bithynia he have the maidenhead of the renowned cleopatra queen of egypt witness the little caesario whom he have by her he also make love to eunoe queen of mauritania and at rome to posthumia the wife of servius sulpitius to lollia the wife of gabinius to tertulla the wife of crassus and even to mutia wife to the great pompey which be the reason the roman historian say that she be repudiate by her husband which plutarch confess to be more than he know and the curio both father and son afterwards reproach pompey when he marry caesar daughter that he have make himself soninlaw to a man who have make him cuckold and one whom he himself be wont to call aegisthus besides all these he entertain servilia catos sister and mother to marcus brutus whence every one believe proceed the great affection he have to brutus by reason that he be bear at a time when it be likely he might be hi son so that i have reason methinks to take him for a man extremely give to this debauch and of very amorous constitution but the other passion of ambition with which he be infinitely smitten arise in him to contend with the former it be boon compel to give way and here call to mind mohammed who win constantinople and finally exterminate the grecian name i do not know where these two be so evenly balance equally an indefatigable lecher and soldier but where they both meet in hi life and jostle one another the quarrel passion always get the good of the amorous one and this though it be out of it natural season never regain an absolute sovereignty over the other till he have arrive at an extreme old age and unable to undergo the fatigue of war what be relate for a contrary example of ladislaus king of naples be very remarkable that be a great captain valiant and ambitious he propose to himself for the principal end of hi ambition the execution of hi pleasure and the enjoyment of some rare and excellent beauty hi death seal up all the rest for have by a close and tedious siege reduce the city of florence to so great distress that the inhabitant be compel to capitulate about surrender he be content to let them alone provide they would deliver up to him a beautiful maid he have heard of in their city they be force to yield to it and by a private injury to avert the public ruin she be the daughter of a famous physician of hi time who find himself involve in so foul a necessity resolve upon a high attempt a every one be lend a hand to trick up hi daughter and to adorn her with ornament and jewel to render her more agreeable to this new lover he also give her a handkerchief most richly wrought and of an exquisite perfume an implement they never go without in those part which she be to make use of at their first approach this handkerchief poison with hi great art come to be rub between the chafed flesh and open pore both of the one and the other so suddenly infuse the poison that immediately convert their warm into a cold sweat they presently die in one anothers arm but i return to caesar hi pleasure never make him steal one minute of an hour nor go one step aside from occasion that might any way conduce to hi advancement this passion be so sovereign in him over all the rest and with so absolute authority possess hi soul that it guide him at pleasure in truth this trouble me when a to everything els i consider the greatness of this man and the wonderful part wherewith he be endue learn to that degree in all sort of knowledge that there be hardly any one science of which he have not write so great an orator that many have prefer hi eloquence to that of cicero and he i conceive do not think himself inferior to him in that particular for hi two anticatos be write to counterbalance the elocution that cicero have expend in hi cato a to the rest be ever soul so vigilant so active and so patient of labour a hi and doubtless it be embellish with many rare seed of virtue lively natural and not put on he be singularly sober so far from be delicate in hi diet that oppius relate how that have one day at table set before him medicate instead of common oil in some sauce he eat heartily of it that he might not put hi entertainer out of countenance another time he cause hi baker to be whip for serve him with a finer than ordinary sort of bread cato himself be wont to say of him that he be the first sober man who ever make it hi business to ruin hi country and a to the same catos call him one day drunkard it fell out thus be both of them in the senate at a time when catilines conspiracy be in question of which be caesar be suspect one come and bring him a letter seal up cato believing that it be something the conspirator give him notice of require him to deliver into hi hand which caesar be constrain to do to avoid further suspicion it be by chance a loveletter that servilia catos sister have write to him which cato have read he throw it back to him say there drunkard this i say be rather a word of disdain and anger than an express reproach of this vice a we often rate those who anger u with the first injurious word that come into our mouth though nothing due to those we be offend at to which may be add that the vice with which cato upbraid him be wonderfully near akin to that wherein he have surprise caesar for bacchus and venus accord to the proverb very willingly agree but to me venus be much more sprightly accompany by sobriety the example of hi sweetness and clemency to those by whom he have be offend be infinite i mean besides those he give during the time of the civil war which a plainly enough appear by hi writing he practise to cajole hi enemy and to make them less afraid of hi future dominion and victory but i must also say that if these example be not sufficient proof of hi natural sweetness they at least manifest a marvellous confidence and grandeur of courage in this person he have often be know to dismiss whole army after have overcome them to hi enemy without ransom or deign so much a to bind them by oath if not to favour him at least no more to bear arm against him he have three or four time take some of pompey captain prisoner and as often set them at liberty pompey declare all those to be enemy who do not follow him to the war he proclaim all those to be hi friend who sit still and do not actually take arm against him to such captain of hi a ran away from him to go over to the other side he send moreover their arm horse and equipage the city he have take by force he leave at full liberty to follow which side they please impose no other garrison upon them but the memory of hi gentleness and clemency he give strict and express charge the day of hi great battle of pharsalia that without the utmost necessity no one should lay a hand upon the citizen of rome these in my opinion be very hazardous proceeding and ti no wonder if those in our civil war who like him fight against the ancient estate of their country do not follow hi example they be extraordinary mean and that only appertain to caesar fortune and to hi admirable foresight in the conduct of affair when i consider the incomparable grandeur of hi soul i excuse victory that it could not disengage itself from him even in so unjust and so wicked a cause to return to hi clemency we have many striking example in the time of hi government when all thing be reduce to hi power he have no more write against him which he have a sharply answer yet he do not soon after forbear to use hi interest to make him consul caius calvus who have compose several injurious epigram against him have employ many of hi friend to mediate a reconciliation with him caesar voluntarily persuade himself to write first to him and our good catullus who have so rudely ruffle him under the name of mamurra come to offer hi excuse to him he make the same day sit at hi table have intelligence of some who speak ill of him he do no more but only by a public oration declare that he have notice of it he still less feared hi enemy than he hat them some conspiracy and cabal that be make against hi life be discover to him he satisfy himself in publishing by proclamation that they be know to him without far prosecute the conspirator a to the respect he have for hi friend caius oppius be with him upon a journey and find himself ill he leave him the only lodging he have for himself and lay all night upon a hard ground in the open air a to what concern hi justice he put a beloved servant of hi to death for lie with a noble roman wife though there be no complaint make never have man more moderation in hi victory nor more resolution in hi adverse fortune but all these good inclination be stifle and spoil by hi furious ambition by which he suffer himself to be so transported and mislead that one may easily maintain that this passion be the rudder of all hi action of a liberal man it make him a public thief to supply this bounty and profusion and make him utter this vile and unjust say that if the most wicked and profligate person in the world have be faithful in serve him towards hi advancement he would cherish and prefer them to the utmost of hi power as much a the best of men it intoxicate him with so excessive a vanity a to dare to boast in the presence of hi fellowcitizens that he have make the great commonwealth of rome a name without form and without body and to say that hi answer for the future should stand for law and also to receive the body of the senate come to him sit to suffer himself to be adore and to have divine honour pay to him in hi own presence to conclude this sole vice in my opinion spoil in him the most rich and beautiful nature that ever be and have render hi name abominable to all good men in that he would erect hi glory upon the ruin of hi country and the subversion of the great and most flourishing republic the world shall ever see there might on the contrary many example be produce of great men whom pleasure have make to neglect the conduct of their affair a mark antony and other but where love and ambition should be in equal balance and come to jostle with equal force i make no doubt but the last would win the prize to return to my subject ti much to bridle our appetite by the argument of reason or by violence to contain our member within their duty but to lash ourselves for our neighbours interest and not only to divest ourselves of the charming passion that tickle u of the pleasure we feel in be agreeable to other and court and beloved of every one but also to conceive a hatred against the grace that produce that effect and to condemn our beauty because it inflame other of this i confess i have meet with few example but this be one spurina a young man of tuscany be endow with a singular beauty and so excessive that the chaste eye could not chastely behold it ray not content himself with leave so much flame and fever a he everywhere kindle without relief enter into a furious spite against himself and those great endowment nature have so liberally confer upon him a if a man be responsible to himself for the fault of other and purposely slash and disfigure with many wound and scar the perfect symmetry and proportion that nature have so curiously imprint in hi face to give my free opinion i more admire than honour such action such excess be enemy to my rule the design be conscientious and good but certainly a little defective in prudence what if hi deformity serve afterwards to make other guilty of the sin of hatred or contempt or of envy at the glory of so rare a recommendation or of calumny interpret this humour a mad ambition be there any form from which vice can not if it will extract occasion to exercise itself one way or another it have be more just and also more noble to have make of these gift of god a subject of exemplary regularity and virtue they who retire themselves from the common office from that infinite number of troublesome rule that fetter a man of exact honesty in civil life be in my opinion very discreet what peculiar sharpness of constraint soever they impose upon themselves in so do ti in some sort a kind of die to avoid the pain of live well they may have another reward but the reward of difficulty i fancy they can never have nor in uneasiness that there can be anything more or good do than the keep oneself upright amid the wave of the world truly and exactly perform all part of our duty ti peradventure more easy to keep clear of the sex than to maintain one self aright in all point in the society of a wife and a man may with less trouble adapt himself to entire abstinence than to the due dispensation of abundance use carry on accord to reason have in it more of difficulty than abstinence moderation be a virtue that give more work than suffer the well living of scipio have a thousand fashion that of diogenes but one this a much excels the ordinary life in innocence a the most accomplished excel them in utility and force ti relate of many great leader that they have have certain book in particular esteem a alexander the great homer scipio africanus xenophon marcus brutus polybius charles v philipde comines and ti say that in our time machiavelli be elsewhere still in repute but the late marshal strozzi who have take caesar for hi man doubtless make the best choice see that it indeed ought to be the breviary of every soldier a be the true and sovereign pattern of the military art and moreover god know with that grace and beauty he have embellish that rich matter with so pure delicate and perfect expression that in my opinion there be no writing in the world comparable to hi a to that business i will set down some rare and particular passage of hi war that remain in my memory hi army be in some consternation upon the rumour that be spread of the great force that king juba be lead against him instead of abate the apprehension which hi soldier have conceive at the news and of lessen to them the force of the enemy have call them all together to encourage and reassure them he take a quite contrary way to what we be use to do for he tell them that they need no more trouble themselves with inquire after the enemy force for that he be certainly inform thereof and then tell them of a number much surpass both the truth and the report that be current in hi army follow the advice of cyrus in xenophon forasmuch a the deception be not of so great importance to find an enemy weak than we expect than to find him really very strong after have be make to believe that he be weak it be always hi use to accustom hi soldier simply to obey without take upon them to control or so much a to speak of their captain design which he never communicate to them but upon the point of execution and he take a delight if they discover anything of what he intend immediately to change hi order to deceive them and to that purpose would often when he have assign hi quarter in a place pas forward and lengthen hi day march especially if it be foul and rainy weather the swiss in the beginning of hi war in gaul have send to him to demand a free passage over the roman territory though resolve to hinder them by force he nevertheless speak kindly to the messenger and take some respite to return an answer to make use of that time for the call hi army together these silly people do not know how good a husband he be of hi time for he often repeat that it be the best part of a captain to know how to make use of occasion and hi diligence in hi exploit be in truth unheard of and incredible if he be not very conscientious in take advantage of an enemy under colour of a treaty of agreement he be as little so in this that he require no other virtue in a soldier but valour only and seldom punish any other fault but mutiny and disobedience he would often after hi victory turn them loose to all sort of licence dispense them for some time from the rule of military discipline say withal that he have soldier so well train up that powder and perfume they would run furiously to the fight in truth he love to have them richly arm and make them wear engrave gilded and damask armour to the end that the care of save it might engage them to a more obstinate defence speak to them he call them by the name of fellowsoldiers which we yet use which hi successor augustus reform suppose he have only do it upon necessity and to cajole those who merely follow him a volunteer but that this carriage be too mean and low for the dignity of an emperor and general of an army and therefore bring up the custom of call them soldier only with this courtesy caesar mixed great severity to keep them in awe the ninth legion have mutiny near placentia he ignominiously cashier them though pompey be then yet on foot and receive them not again to grace till after many supplication he quiet them more by authority and boldness than by gentle way in that place where he speak of hi passage over the rhine to germany he say that think it unworthy of the honour of the roman people to waft over hi army in vessel he build a bridge that they might pass over dryfoot there it be that he build that wonderful bridge of which he give so particular a description for he nowhere so willingly dwell upon hi action a in represent to u the subtlety of hi invention in such kind of handiwork i have also observe this that he set a great value upon hi exhortation to the soldier before the fight for where he would show that he be either surprised or reduce to a necessity of fight he always bring in this that he have not so much a leisure to harangue hi army before that great battle with those of tournay caesar say he have give order for everything els presently run where fortune carry him to encourage hi people and meet with the tenth legion have no more time to say anything to them but this that they should remember their wonted valour not to be astonish but bravely sustain the enemy encounter and see the enemy have already approach within a dart cast he give the signal for battle and go suddenly thence elsewhere to encourage other he find that they be already engage here be what he tell u in that place hi tongue indeed do him notable service upon several occasion and hi military eloquence be in hi own time so highly repute that many of hi army write down hi harangue a he speak them by which mean there be volume of them collect that exist a long time after him he have so particular a grace in speak that hi intimate and augustus amongst other hear those oration read could distinguish even to the phrase and word that be not hi the first time that he go out of rome with any public command he arrive in eight day at the river rhone have with him in hi coach a secretary or two before him who be continually write and him who carry hi sword behind him and certainly though a man do nothing but go on he could hardly attain that promptitude with which have be everywhere victorious in gaul he leave it and follow pompey to brundusium in eighteen day time he subdue all italy return from brundusium to rome from rome go into the very heart of spain where he surmount extreme difficulty in the war against afranius and petreius and in the long siege of marseille thence he return into macedonia beat the roman army at pharsalia pass thence in pursuit of pompey into egypt which he also subdue from egypt he go into syria and the territory of pontus where he fight pharnaces thence into africa where he defeat scipio and juba again return through italy where he defeat pompey son speaking of the siege of avaricum he say that it be hi custom to be night and day with the pioneer in all enterprise of consequence he always reconnoitre in person and never bring hi army into quarter till he have first view the place and if we may believe suetonius when he resolve to pass over into england he be the first man that sound the passage he be wont to say that he more value a victory obtain by counsel than by force and in the war against petreius and afranius fortune present him with an occasion of manifest advantage he decline it say that he hop with a little more time but less hazard to overthrow hi enemy he there also play a notable part in command hi whole army to pass the river by swim without any manner of necessity i find him a little more temperate and considerate in hi enterprise than alexander for this man seem to seek and run headlong upon danger like an impetuous torrent which attack and rush against everything it meet without choice or discretion and indeed he be a general in the flower and first heat of hi youth whereas caesar take up the trade at a ripe and well advanced age to which may be add that alexander be of a more sanguine hot and choleric constitution which he also inflame with wine from which caesar be very abstinent but where necessary occasion require never do any man venture hi person more than he so much so that for my part methinks i read in many of hi exploit a determinate resolution to throw himself away to avoid the shame of be overcome in hi great battle with those of tournay he charge up to the head of the enemy without hi shield just a he be see the van of hi own army begin to give ground which also several other time befall him hear that hi people be besiege he pass through the enemys army in disguise to go and encourage them with hi presence having cross over to dyrrachium with very slender force and see the remainder of hi army which he have leave to antony conduct slow in follow him he undertake alone to repass the sea in a very great storm and privately steal away to fetch the rest of hi force the port on the other side be seize by pompey and the whole sea be in hi possession and a to what he perform by force of hand there be many exploit that in hazard exceed all the rule of war for with how small mean do he undertake to subdue the kingdom of egypt and afterwards to attack the force of scipio and juba ten time great than hi own these people have i know not what more than human confidence in their fortune and he be wont to say that men must embark and not deliberate upon high enterprise after the battle of pharsalia when he have send hi army away before him into asia and be pass in one single vessel the strait of the hellespont he meet lucius cassius at sea with ten tall menofwar when he have the courage not only to stay hi come but to sail up to him and summon him to yield which he do have undertaken that furious siege of alexia where there be fourscore thousand men in garrison all gaul be in arm to raise the siege and have set an army on foot of a hundred and nine thousand horse and of two hundred and forty thousand foot what a boldness and vehement confidence be it in him that he would not give over hi attempt but resolve upon two so great difficulty which nevertheless he overcame and after have win that great battle against those without soon reduce those within to hi mercy the same happen to lucullus at the siege of tigranocerta against king tigranes but the condition of the enemy be not the same consider the effeminacy of those with whom lucullus have to deal i will here set down two rare and extraordinary event concern this siege of alexia one that the gaul have draw their power together to encounter caesar after they have make a general muster of all their force resolve in their council of war to dismiss a good part of this great multitude that they might not fall into confusion this example of fear to be too many be new but to take it right it stand to reason that the body of an army should be of a moderate greatness and regulate to certain bound both out of respect to the difficulty of provide for them and the difficulty of govern and keep them in order at least it be very easy to make it appear by example that armies monstrous in number have seldom do anything to purpose accord to the saying of cyrus in xenophon ti not the number of men but the number of good men that give the advantage the remainder serve rather to trouble than assist and bajazet principally ground hi resolution of give tamerlane battle contrary to the opinion of all hi captain upon this that hi enemy numberless number of men give him assured hope of confusion scanderbeg a very good and expert judge in such matter be wont to say that ten or twelve thousand reliable fight men be sufficient to a good leader to secure hi regulation in all sort of military occasion the other thing i will here record which seem to be contrary both to the custom and rule of war be that vercingetorix who be make general of all the part of the revolted gaul should go shut up himself in alexia for he who have the command of a whole country ought never to shut himself up but in case of such last extremity that the only place he have leave be in concern and that the only hope he have leave be in the defence of that city otherwise he ought to keep himself always at liberty that he may have the mean to provide in general for all part of hi government to return to caesar he grow in time more slow and more considerate a hi friend oppius witness conceive that he ought not lightly to hazard the glory of so many victory which one blow of fortune might deprive him of ti what the italian say when they would reproach the rashness and foolhardiness of young people call them bisognosi donor necessitous of honour and that be in so great a want and dearth of reputation they have reason to seek it at what price soever which they ought not to do who have acquire enough already there may reasonably be some moderation some satiety in this thirst and appetite of glory as well a in other thing and there be enough people who practise it he be far remote from the religious scruple of the ancient roman who would never prevail in their war but by dint of pure and simple valour and yet he be more conscientious than we should be in these day and do not approve all sort of mean to obtain a victory in the war against ariovistus whilst he be parley with him there happen some commotion between the horseman which be occasion by the fault of ariovistus light horse wherein though caesar saw he have a very great advantage of the enemy he would make no use ont l he should have be reproach with a treacherous proceeding he be always wont to wear rich garment and of a shin colour in battle that he might be the more remarkable and good observe he always carry a stricter and tight hand over hi soldier when near an enemy when the ancient greek would accuse any one of extreme insufficiency they would say in common proverb that he could neither read nor swim he be of the same opinion that swim be of great use in war and himself find it so for when he have to use diligence he commonly swim over the river in hi way for he love to march on foot a also do alexander the great being in egypt force to save himself to go into a little boat and so many people leap in with him that it be in danger of sink he choose rather to commit himself to the sea and swam to hi fleet which lay two hundred pace off hold in hi left hand hi tablet and draw hi coatarmour in hi teeth that it might not fall into the enemys hand and at this time he be of a pretty advanced age never have any general so much credit with hi soldier in the beginning of the civil war hi centurion offer him to find every one a manatarms at hi own charge and the foot soldier to serve him at their own expense those who be most at their ease moreover undertake to defray the more necessitous the late admiral chastillon show u the like example in our civil war for the french of hi army provide money out of their own purse to pay the foreigner that be with him there be but rarely find example of so ardent and so ready an affection amongst the soldier of elder time who keep themselves strictly to their rule of war passion have a more absolute command over u than reason and yet it happen in the war against hannibal that by the example of the people of rome in the city the soldier and captain refuse their pay in the army and in marcellus camp those be brand with the name of mercenary who would receive any having get the bad of it near dyrrachium hi soldier come and offer themselves to be chastise and punish so that there be more need to comfort than reprove them one single cohort of hi withstood four of pompey legion above four hour together till they be almost all kill with arrow so that there be a hundred and thirty thousand shaft find in the trench a soldier call scaeva who command at one of the avenue invincibly maintain hi ground have lose an eye with one shoulder and one thigh shot through and hi shield hit in two hundred and thirty place it happen that many of hi soldier be take prisoner rather choose to die than promise to join the contrary side granius petronius be take by scipio in africa scipio have put the rest to death send him word that he give him hi life for he be a man of quality and quaestor to whom petronius send answer back that caesar soldier be wont to give other their life and not to receive it and immediately with hi own hand kill himself of their fidelity there be infinite example amongst them that which be do by those who be besiege in salona a city that stand for caesar against pompey be not for the rarity of an accident that there happen to be forget marcus octavius keep them close besiege they within be reduce to the extreme necessity of all thing so that to supply the want of men most of them be either slain or wound they have manumit all their slave and have be constrain to cut off all the woman hair to make rope for their war engine besides a wonderful dearth of victual and yet continue resolute never to yield after have draw the siege to a great length by which octavius be grow more negligent and less attentive to hi enterprise they make choice of one day about noon and have first place the woman and child upon the wall to make a show sallied upon the besieger with such fury that have rout the first second and third body and afterwards the fourth and the rest and beat them all out of their trench they pursue them even to their ship and octavius himself be fain to fly to dyrrachium where pompey lay i do not at present remember that i have meet with any other example where the besiege ever give the besieger a total defeat and win the field nor that a sortie ever achieve the result of a pure and entire victory they be not by the dozen a every one know and especially in the duty of marriage for that be a bargain full of so many nice circumstance that tis hard a woman will should long endure such a restraint men though their condition be something well under that tie have yet enough to do the true touch and test of a happy marriage have respect to the time of the companionship if it have be constantly gentle loyal and agreeable in our age woman commonly reserve the publication of their good office and their vehement affection towards their husband until they have lose them or at least till then defer the testimony of their good will a too slow testimony and unseasonable by it they rather manifest that they never love them till dead their life be nothing but trouble their death full of love and courtesy a father conceal their affection from their child woman likewise conceal theirs from their husband to maintain a modest respect this mystery be not for my palate ti to much purpose that they scratch themselves and tear their hair i whisper in a waitingwomans or secretarys ear how be they how do they live together i always have that good say m my head their whimpering be offensive to the living and vain to the dead we should willingly give them leave to laugh after we be dead provide they will smile upon u whilst we be alive is it not enough to make a man revive in pure spite that she who spat in my face whilst i be in be shall come to kiss my foot when i be no more if there be any honour in lament a husband it only appertain to those who smile upon them whilst they have them let those who weep during their life laugh at their death a well outwardly a within therefore never regard those blubbered eye and that pitiful voice consider her deportment her complexion the plumpness of her cheek under all those formal veil ti there she talk plain french there be few who do not mend upont and health be a quality that can not lie that starch and ceremonious countenance look not so much back a forward and be rather intend to get a new husband than to lament the old when i be a boy a very beautiful and virtuous lady who be yet live the widow of a prince wear somewhat more ornament in her dress than our law of widowhood allow and be reproach with it she make answer that it be because she be resolve to have no more love affair and would never marry again i have here not at all dissent from our custom make choice of three woman who have also express the utmost of their goodness and affection about their husband death yet be they example of another kind than be now m use and so austere that they will hardly be draw into imitation the young pliny have near a house of hi in italy a neighbour who be exceedingly torment with certain ulcer in hi private part hi wife see him so long to languish entreat that he would give her leave to see and at leisure to consider of the condition of hi disease and that she would freely tell him what she think this permission be obtain and she have curiously examine the business find it impossible he could ever be cure and that all he have to hope for or expect be a great while to linger out a painful and miserable life and therefore a the most sure and sovereign remedy resolutely advise him to kill himself but find him a little tender and backward in so rude an attempt do not think my friend say she that the torment i see thee endure be not a sensible to me a to thyself and that to deliver myself from them i will not myself make use of the same remedy i have prescribe to thee i will accompany thee in the cure a i have do in the disease fear nothing but believe that we shall have pleasure in this passage that be to free u from so many misery and we will go happily together which have say and rouse up her husband courage she resolve that they should throw themselves headlong into the sea out of a window that overlook it and that she might maintain to the last the loyal and vehement affection wherewith she have embrace him during hi life she would also have him die in her arm but l they should fail and should quit their hold in the fall through fear she tie herself fast to him by the waist and so give up her own life to procure her husband repose this be a woman of mean condition and amongst that class of people tis no very new thing to see some example of rare virtue the other two be noble and rich where example of virtue be rarely lodge arria the wife of caecina paetus a consular person be the mother of another arria the wife of thrasea paetus he whose virtue be so renowned in the time of nero and by this soninlaw the grandmother of fannia for the resemblance of the name of these men and woman and their fortune have lead to several mistake this first arria her husband caecina paetus have be take prisoner by some of the emperor claudius people after scribonianus defeat whose party he have embrace in the war beg of those who be to carry him prisoner to rome that they would take her into their ship where she would be of much less charge and trouble to them than a great many person they must otherwise have to attend her husband and that she alone would undertake to serve him in hi chamber hi kitchen and all other office they refuse whereupon she put herself into a fisherboat she hire on the spot and in that manner follow him from sclavonia when she have come to rome junia the widow of scribonianus have one day from the resemblance of their fortune accost her in the emperor presence she rudely repulse her with these word i say she speak to thee or give ear to any thing thou sayest to thee in whose lap scribonianus be slay and thou art yet alive these word with several other sign give her friend to understand that she would undoubtedly despatch herself impatient of support her husband misfortune and thrasea her soninlaw beseech her not to throw away herself and say to her what if i should run the same fortune that caecina have do would you that your daughter my wife should do the same would i reply she yes yes i would if she have live a long and in as good understanding with thee a i have do with my husband these answer make them more careful of her and to have a more watchful eye to her proceeding one day have say to those who look to her ti to much purpose that you take all this pain to prevent me you may indeed make me die an ill death but to keep me from die be not in your power she in a sudden phrenzy start from a chair whereon she sit and with all her force dash her head against the wall by which blow be lay flat in a swoon and very much wound after they have again with great ado bring her to herself i tell you say she that if you refuse me some easy way of die i should find out another how painful soever the conclusion of so admirable a virtue be this her husband paetus not have resolution enough of hi own to despatch himself a he be by the emperor cruelty enjoin one day amongst other after have first employ all the reason and exhortation which she think most prevalent to persuade him to it she snatch the poignard he wear from hi side and hold it ready in her hand for the conclusion of her admonition do thus paetus say she and in the same instant give herself a mortal stab in the breast and then draw it out of the wound present it to him end her life with this noble generous and immortal say paete non dolet have time to pronounce no more but those three nevertobeforgotten word paetus it be not painful the action be much more noble in itself and of a braver sense than the poet express it for she be so far from be deter by the thought of her husband wound and death and her own that she have be their promotress and adviser but have perform this high and courageous enterprise for her husband only convenience she have even in the last gasp of her life no other concern but for him and of dispossess him of the fear of die with her paetus presently strike himself to the heart with the same weapon ashamed i suppose to have stand in need of so dear and precious an example pompeia paulina a young and very noble roman lady have marry seneca in hi extreme old age nero hi fine pupil send hi guard to him to denounce the sentence of death which be perform after this manner when the roman emperor of those time have condemn any man of quality they send to him by their officer to choose what death he would and to execute it within such or such a time which be limit accord to the degree of their indignation to a shorter or a longer respite that they might therein have good leisure to dispose their affair and sometimes deprive them of the mean of do it by the shortness of the time and if the condemn seem unwilling to submit to the order they have people ready at hand to execute it either by cut the vein of the arm and leg or by compel them by force to swallow a draught of poison but person of honour would not abide this necessity but make use of their own physician and surgeon for this purpose seneca with a calm and steady countenance hear their charge and presently call for paper to write hi will which be by the captain refuse he turn himself towards hi friend say to them since i can not leave you any other acknowledgment of the obligation i have to you i leave you at least the best thing i have namely the image of my life and manner which i entreat you to keep in memory of me that by so do you may acquire the glory of sincere and real friend and there withal one while appease the sorrow he saw in them with gentle word and presently raise hi voice to reprove them what say he be become of all our brave philosophical precept what be become of all the provision we have so many year lay up against the accident of fortune is nero cruelty unknown to u what could we expect from him who have murder hi mother and hi brother but that he should put hi tutor to death who have bring him up after have speak these word in general he turn himself towards hi wife and embrace her fast in hi arm a her heart and strength fail her she be ready to sink down with grief he beg of her for hi sake to bear this accident with a little more patience tell her that now the hour be come wherein he be to show not by argument and discourse but effect the fruit he have acquire by hi study and that he really embrace hi death not only without grief but moreover with joy wherefore my dearest say he do not dishonour it with thy tear that it may not seem a if thou lovest thyself more than my reputation moderate thy grief and comfort thyself in the knowledge thou hast have of me and my action lead the remainder of thy life in the same virtuous manner thou hast hitherto do to which paulina have a little recovered her spirit and warm the magnanimity of her courage with a most generous affection repliedno seneca say she i be not a woman to suffer you to go alone in such a necessity i will not have you think that the virtuous example of your life have not teach me how to die and when can i ever well or more fittingly do it or more to my own desire than with you and therefore assure yourself i will go along with you then seneca take this noble and generous resolution of hi wife m good part and also willing to free himself from the fear of leave her expose to the cruelty of hi enemy after hi death i have paulina say he instruct thee in what would serve thee happily to live but thou more covetest i see the honour of die in truth i will not grudge it thee the constancy and resolution in our common end be the same but the beauty and glory of thy part be much great which be say the surgeon at the same time open the vein of both their arm but a those of seneca be more shrunk up as well with age a abstinence make hi blood flow too slowly he moreover command them to open the vein of hi thigh and l the torment he endure might pierce hi wifes heart and also to free himself from the affliction of see her in so sad a condition after have take a very affectionate leave of her he entreat she would suffer them to carry her into her chamber which they accordingly do but all these incision be not yet enough to make him die he command statius anneus hi physician to give him a draught of poison which have not much well effect for by reason of the weakness and coldness of hi limb it could not arrive at hi heart wherefore they be force to superadd a very hot bath and then feel hi end approach whilst he have breath he continue excellent discourse upon the subject of hi present condition which the secretary write down so long a they could hear hi voice and hi last word be long after in high honour and esteem amongst men and it be a great loss to u that they have not come down to our time then feel the last pang of death with the bloody water of the bath he bath hi head say this water i dedicate to jupiter the deliverer nero be presently inform of all this fear l the death of paulina who be one of the bestborn lady of rome and against whom he have no particular unkindness should turn to hi reproach send order in all haste to bind up her wound which her attendant do without her knowledge she be already half dead and without all manner of sense thus though she live contrary to her own design it be very honourably and befit her own virtue her pale complexion ever after manifest how much life have run from her vein these be my three very true story which i find a entertaining and as tragic a any of those we make out of our own head wherewith to amuse the common people and i wonder that they who be addict to such relation do not rather cull out ten thousand very fine story which be to be find in book that would save them the trouble of invention and be more useful and diverting and he who would make a whole and connect body of them would need to add nothing of hi own but the connection only a it be the solder of another metal and might by this mean embody a great many true event of all sort dispose and diversify them accord a the beauty of the work should require after the same manner almost a ovid have make up hi metamorphosis of the infinite number of various fable in the last couple this be moreover worthy of consideration that paulina voluntarily offer to lose her life for the love of her husband and that her husband have formerly also forborne to die for the love of her we may think there be no just counterpoise in this exchange but accord to hi stoical humour i fancy he think he have do as much for her in prolong hi life upon her account a if he have die for her in one of hi letter to lucilius after he have give him to understand that be seize with an ague in rome he presently take coach to go to a house he have in the country contrary to hi wifes opinion who would have him stay and that he have tell her that the ague he be seize with be not a fever of the body but of the place it follow thus she let me go say he give me a strict charge of my health now i who know that her life be involve in mine begin to make much of myself that i may preserve her and i lose the privilege my age have give me of be more constant and resolute in many thing when i call to mind that in this old fellow there be a young girl who be interested in hi health and since i can not persuade her to love me more courageously she make me more solicitously love myself for we must allow something to honest affection and sometimes though occasion importune u to the contrary we must call back life even though it be with torment we must hold the soul fast in our teeth since the rule of living amongst good men be not so long a they please but as long a they ought he that love not hi wife nor hi friend so well a to prolong hi life for them but will obstinately die be too delicate and too effeminate the soul must impose this upon itself when the utility of our friend so require we must sometimes lend ourselves to our friend and when we would die for ourselves must break that resolution for them tis a testimony of grandeur of courage to return to life for the consideration of another a many excellent person have do and tis a mark of singular good nature to preserve old age of which the great convenience be the indifference a to it duration and a more stout and disdainful use of life when a man perceive that this office be please agreeable and useful to some person by whom he be very much beloved and a man reaps by it a very pleasing reward for what can be more delightful than to be so dear to hi wife a upon her account he shall become dearer to himself thus have my paulina load me not only with her fear but my own it have not be sufficient to consider how resolutely i could die but i have also consider how irresolutely she would bear my death i be enforce to live and sometimes to live in magnanimity these be hi own word as excellent a they everywhere be if i should be ask my choice among all the men who have come to my knowledge i should make answer that methinks i find three more excellent than all the rest one of them homer not that aristotle and varro for example be not peradventure as learn a he nor that possibly virgil be not equal to him in hi own art which i leave to be determine by such a know them both i who for my part understand but one of them can only say this accord to my poor talent that i do not believe the mus themselves could ever go beyond the roman and yet in this judgment we be not to forget that it be chiefly from homer that virgil derive hi excellence that he be guide and teacher and that one touch of the iliad have supply him with body and matter out of which to compose hi great and divine aeneid i do not reckon upon that but mix several other circumstance that render to me this poet admirable even a it be above human condition and in truth i often wonder that he who have produce and by hi authority give reputation in the world to so many deity be not deify himself be blind and poor living before the science be reduce into rule and certain observation he be so well acquaint with them that all those who have since take upon them to establish government to carry on war and to write either of religion or philosophy of what sect soever or of the art have make use of him a of a most perfect instructor in the knowledge of all thing and of hi book a of a treasury of all sort of learn and a this other say and the other and the other ti contrary to the order of nature that he have make the most excellent production that can possibly be for the ordinary birth of thing be imperfect they thrive and gather strength by grow whereas he render the infancy of poesy and several other science mature perfect and accomplish at first and for this reason he may be call the first and the last of the poet accord to the fine testimony antiquity have leave u of him that a there be none before him whom he could imitate so there have be none since that could imitate him hi word accord to aristotle be the only word that have motion and action the only substantial word alexander the great have find a rich cabinet amongst darius spoil give order it should be reserve for him to keep hi homer in say that he be the best and most faithful counsellor he have in hi military affair for the same reason it be that cleomenes the son of anaxandridas say that he be the poet of the lacedaemonians for that he be an excellent master for the discipline of war this singular and particular commendation be also leave of him in the judgment of plutarch that he be the only author in the world that never glut nor disgust hi reader present himself always another thing and always flourish in some new grace that wanton alcibiades have ask one who pretend to learn for a book of homer give him a box of the ear because he have none which he think as scandalous a we should if we find one of our priest without a breviary xenophanes complain one day to hiero the tyrant of syracuse that he be so poor he have not wherewithal to maintain two servant what reply he homer who be much poor than thou art keep above ten thousand though he be dead what do panaetius leave unsaid when he call plato the homer of the philosopher besides what glory can be compare to hi nothing be so frequent in mens mouth a hi name and work nothing so known and receive a troy helen and the war about her when perhaps there be never any such thing our child be still call by name that he invent above three thousand year ago who do not know hector and achilles not only some particular family but most nation also seek their origin in hi invention mohammed the second of that name emperor of the turk writing to our pope pius ii i be astonished say he that the italian should appear against me consider that we have our common descent from the trojan and that it concern me as well a it do them to revenge the blood of hector upon the greek whom they countenance against me be it not a noble farce wherein king republic and emperor have so many age play their part and to which the vast universe serf for a theatre seven grecian city contend for hi birth so much honour even hi obscurity help him to the other be alexander the great for whoever will consider the age at which he begin hi enterprises the small mean by which he effect so glorious a design the authority he obtain in such mere youth with the great and most experienced captain of the world by whom he be follow the extraordinary favour wherewith fortune embrace and favour so many hazardous not to say rash exploit that greatness to have at the age of threeandthirty year pass victorious through the whole habitable earth and in half a life to have attain to the utmost of what human nature can do so that you can not imagine it just duration and the continuation of hi increase in valour and fortune up to a due maturity of age but that you must withal imagine something more than man to have make so many royal branch to spring from hi soldier leave the world at hi death divide amongst four successor simple captain of hi army whose posterity so long continued and maintain that vast possession so many excellent virtue a he be master of justice temperance liberality truth in hi word love towards hi own people and humanity towards those he overcame for hi manner in general seem in truth incapable of any manner of reproach although some particular and extraordinary action of hi may fall under censure but it be impossible to carry on such great thing a he do within the strict rule of justice such a he be to be judge in gross by the main end of their action the ruin of thebe and persepolis the murder of menander and of ephistions physician the massacre of so many persian prisoner at one time of a troop of indian soldier not without prejudice to hi word and of the cossians so much a to the very child be indeed sally that be not well to be excuse for a to clytus the fault be more than redeem and that very action as much a any other whatever manifest the goodness of hi nature a nature most excellently form to goodness and it be ingeniously say of him that he have hi virtue from nature hi vice from fortune a to hi be a little give to brag a little too impatient of hear himself illspoken of and a to those manger arm and bit he cause to be strew in the indie all those little vanity methinks may very well be allow to hi youth and the prodigious prosperity of hi fortune and who will consider withal hi so many military virtue hi diligence foresight patience discipline subtlety magnanimity resolution and good fortune wherein though we have not have the authority of hannibal to assure u he be the first of men the admirable beauty and symmetry of hi person even to a miracle hi majestic port and awful mien in a face so young ruddy and radiant the excellence of hi knowledge and capacity the duration and grandeur of hi glory pure clean without spot or envy and that long after hi death it be a religious belief that hi very medal bring good fortune to all who carry them about them and that more king and prince have write hi action than other historian have write the action of any other king or prince whatever and that to this very day the mohammedan who despise all other history admit of and honour hi alone by a special privilege whoever i say will seriously consider these particular will confess that all these thing put together i have reason to prefer him before caesar himself who alone could make me doubtful in my choice and it can not be deny that there be more of hi own in hi exploit and more of fortune in those of alexander they be in many thing equal and peradventure caesar have some great quality they be two fire or two torrent overrun the world by several way but though caesar ambition have be more moderate it would still be so unhappy have the ruin of hi country and universal mischief to the world for it abominable object that all thing rake together and put into the balance i must need incline to alexander side the third and in my opinion the most excellent be epaminondas of glory he have not near so much a the other two which for that matter be but a part of the substance of the thing of valour and resolution not of that sort which be push on by ambition but of that which wisdom and reason can plant in a regular soul he have all that could be imagine of this virtue of hi he have in my idea give a ample proof a alexander himself or caesar for although hi warlike exploit be neither so frequent nor so full they be yet if duly consider in all their circumstance as important a bravely fought and carry with them a manifest testimony of valour and military conduct a those of any whatever the greek have do him the honour without contradiction to pronounce him the great man of their nation and to be the first of greece be easily to be the first of the world a to hi knowledge we have this ancient judgment of him that never any man know so much and spake so little a he for he be of the pythagorean sect but when he do speak never any man spake good an excellent orator and of powerful persuasion but a to hi manner and conscience he infinitely surpass all men who ever undertake the management of affair for in this one thing which ought chiefly to be consider which alone truly denote u for what we be and which alone i make counterbalance all the rest put together he come not short of any philosopher whatever not even of socrates himself innocence in this man be a quality peculiar sovereign constant uniform incorruptible compare with which it appear in alexander subject to something els subaltern uncertain variable effeminate and fortuitous antiquity have judge that in thoroughly sift all the other great captain there be find in every one some peculiar quality that illustrate hi name in this man only there be a full and equal virtue throughout that leave nothing to be wish for in him whether in private or public employment whether in peace or war whether to live gloriously and grandly and to die i do not know any form or fortune of man that i so much honour and love ti true that i look upon hi obstinate poverty a it be set out by hi best friend a a little too scrupulous and nice and this be the only feature though high in itself and well worthy of admiration that i find so rugged a not to desire to imitate to the degree it be in him scipio aemilianus alone could one attribute to him a brave and magnificent an end and a profound and universal a knowledge might be put into the other scale of the balance oh what an injury have time do me to deprive me of the sight of two of the most noble life which by the common consent of all the world one of the great of the greek and the other of the roman be in all plutarch what a matter what a workman for a man that be no saint but a we say a gentleman of civilian and ordinary manner and of a moderate ambition the rich life that i know and full of the rich and most to be desire part all thing consider be in my opinion that of alcibiades but a to what concern epaminondas i will here for the example of an excessive goodness add some of hi opinion he declare that the great satisfaction he ever have in hi whole life be the contentment he give hi father and mother by hi victory at leuctra wherein hi deference be great prefer their pleasure before hi own so dust and so full of so glorious an action he do not think it lawful even to restore the liberty of hi country to kill a man without know a cause which make him so cold in the enterprise of hi companion pelopidas for the relief of thebe he be also of opinion that men in battle ought to avoid the encounter of a friend who be on the contrary side and to spare him and hi humanity even towards hi enemy themselves have render him suspect to the boeotian for that after he have miraculously force the lacedaemonians to open to him the pas which they have undertake to defend at the entrance into the morea near corinth he content himself with have charge through them without pursue them to the utmost he have hi commission of general take from him very honourably upon such an account and for the shame it be to them upon necessity afterwards to restore him to hi command and so to manifest how much upon him depend their safety and honour victory like a shadow attend him wherever he go and indeed the prosperity of hi country a be from him derive die with him this faggot up of so many diver piece be so do that i never set pen to paper but when i have too much idle time and never anywhere but at home so that it be compile after diver interruption and interval occasion keep me sometimes many month elsewhere a to the rest i never correct my first by any second conception i peradventure may alter a word or so but tis only to vary the phrase and not to destroy my former meaning i have a mind to represent the progress of my humour and that every one may see each piece a it come from the forge i could wish i have begin sooner and have take more notice of the course of my mutation a servant of mine whom i employ to transcribe for me think he have get a prize by steal several piece from me wherewith he be best pleased but it be my comfort that he will be no great a gainer than i shall be a loser by the theft i be grown older by seven or eight year since i begin nor have it be without same new acquisition i have in that time by the liberality of year be acquaint with the stone their commerce and long converse do not well pass away without some such inconvenience i could have be glad that of other infirmity age have to present longlived men withal it have choose some one that would have be more welcome to me for it could not possibly have lay upon me a disease for which even from my infancy i have have so great a horror and it be in truth of all the accident of old age that of which i have ever be most afraid i have often think with myself that i go on too far and that in so long a voyage i should at last run myself into some disadvantage i perceive and have often enough declare that it be time to depart and that life should be cut off in the sound and live part accord to the surgeon rule in amputation and that nature make him pay very strict usury who do not in due time pay the principal and yet i be so far from be ready that in the eighteen month time or thereabout that i have be in this uneasy condition i have so inure myself to it a to be content to live on in it and have find wherein to comfort myself and to hope so much be men enslave to their miserable be that there be no condition so wretched they will not accept provide they may live hear maecenas and tamerlane with a foolish humanity palliate the fantastic cruelty he exercise upon leper when he put all he could hear of to death to deliver them a he pretend from the painful life they live for there be not one of them who would not rather have be thrice a leper than be not and antisthenes the stoic be very sick and cry out who will deliver me from these evil diogenes who have come to visit him this say he present him a knife soon enough if thou wilti do not mean from my life he reply but from my suffering the suffering that only attack the mind i be not so sensible of a most other men and this partly out of judgment for the world look upon several thing a dreadful or to be avoid at the expense of life that be almost indifferent to me partly through a dull and insensible complexion i have in accident which do not pointblank hit me and that insensibility i look upon a one of the best part of my natural condition but essential and corporeal pain i be very sensible of and yet have long since foreseen them though with a sight weak and delicate and soften with the long and happy health and quiet that god have be please to give me the great part of my time i have in my imagination fancy them so insupportable that in truth i be more afraid than i have since find i have cause by which i be still more fortified in this belief that most of the faculty of the soul a we employ them more trouble the repose of life than they be any way useful to it i be in conflict with the bad the most sudden the most painful the most mortal and the most irremediable of all disease i have already have the trial of five or six very long and very painful fit and yet i either flat myself or there be even in this state what be very well to be endure by a man who have hi soul free from the fear of death and of the menace conclusion and consequence which physic be ever thunder in our ear but the effect even of pain itself be not so sharp and intolerable a to put a man of understand into rage and despair i have at least this advantage by my stone that what i could not hitherto prevail upon myself to resolve upon a to reconcile and acquaint myself with death it will perfect for the more it press upon and importune me i shall be so much the less afraid to die i have already go so far a only to love life for lifes sake but my pain will dissolve this intelligence and god grant that in the end should the sharpness of it be once great than i shall be able to bear it do not throw me into the other no less vicious extreme to desire and wish to die they be two passion to be fear but the one have it remedy much nearer at hand than the other a to the rest i have always find the precept that so rigorously enjoin a resolute countenance and disdainful and indifferent comportment in the toleration of infirmity to be ceremonial why should philosophy which only have respect to life and effect trouble itself about these external appearance let u leave that care to actor and master of rhetoric who set so great a value upon our gesture let her allow this vocal frailty to disease if it be neither cordial nor stomachic and permit the ordinary way of express grief by sigh sobs palpitation and turn pale that nature have put out of our power provide the courage be undaunted and the tone not expressive of despair let her be satisfy what matter the wringing of our hand if we do not wring our thought she form u for ourselves not for other to be not to seem let her be satisfy with govern our understanding which she have take upon her the care of instruct that in the fury of the colic she maintain the soul in a condition to know itself and to follow it accustomed way contend with and endure not meanly truckle under pain move and heat not subdue and conquer in the contention capable of discourse and other thing to a certain degree in such extreme accident tis cruelty to require so exact a composed ti no great matter that we make a wry face if the mind play it part well if the body find itself relieve by complain let it complain if agitation ease it let it tumble and toss at pleasure if it seem to find the disease evaporate a some physician hold that it help woman in delivery in make loud outcry or if this do but divert it torment let it roar a it will let u not command this voice to sally but stop it not epicurus not only forgive hi sage for cry out in torment but advise him to it we have enough to do to deal with the disease without trouble ourselves with these superfluous rule which i say in excuse of those whom we ordinarily see impatient in the assault of this malady for a to what concern myself i have pass it over hitherto with a little good countenance and content myself with groan without roar out not nevertheless that i put any great constraint upon myself to maintain this exterior decorum for i make little account of such an advantage i allow herein as much a the pain require but either my pain be not so excessive or i have more than ordinary patience i complain i confess and be a little impatient in a very sharp fit but i do not arrive to such a degree of despair a he who with i try myself in the depth of my suffering and have always find that i be in a capacity to speak think and give a rational answer as well a at any other time but not so firmly be trouble and interrupt by the pain when i be look upon by my visitor to be in the great torment and that they therefore forbear to trouble me i often essay my own strength and myself set some discourse on foot the most remote i can contrive from my present condition i can do anything upon a sudden endeavour but it must not continue long oh what pity ti i have not the faculty of that dreamer in cicero who dream he be lie with a wench find he have discharge hi stone in the sheet my pain strangely deaden my appetite that way in the interval from this excessive torment when my ureter only languish without any great dolor i presently feel myself in my wonted state forasmuch a my soul take no other alarm but what be sensible and corporal which i certainly owe to the care i have have of prepare myself by meditation against such accident i be however a little roughly handle for an apprentice and with a sudden and sharp alteration be fall in an instant from a very easy and happy condition of life into the most uneasy and painful that can be imagine for besides that it be a disease very much to be fear in itself it begin with me after a more sharp and severe manner than it be use to do with other men my fit come so thick upon me that i be scarcely ever at ease yet i have hitherto keep my mind so upright that provide i can still continue it i find myself in a much good condition of life than a thousand other who have no few nor other disease but what they create to themselves for want of meditation there be a certain sort of crafty humility that spring from presumption a this for example that we confess our ignorance in many thing and be so courteous a to acknowledge that there be in the work of nature some quality and condition that be imperceptible to u and of which our understanding can not discover the mean and cause by this so honest and conscientious declaration we hope to obtain that people shall also believe u a to those that we say we do understand we need not trouble ourselves to seek out foreign miracle and difficulty methinks amongst the thing that we ordinarily see there be such incomprehensible wonder a surpass all difficulty of miracle what a wonderful thing it be that the drop of seed from which we be produce should carry in itself the impression not only of the bodily form but even of the thought and inclination of our father where can that drop of fluid matter contain that infinite number of form and how can they carry on these resemblance with so precarious and irregular a process that the son shall be like hi greatgrandfather the nephew like hi uncle in the family of lepidus at rome there be three not successively but by interval who be bear with the same eye cover with a cartilage at thebe there be a race that carry from their mother womb the form of the head of a lance and he who be not bear so be look upon a illegitimate and aristotle say that in a certain nation where the woman be in common they assign the child to their father by their resemblance ti to be believe that i derive this infirmity from my father for he die wonderfully torment with a great stone in hi bladder he be never sensible of hi disease till the sixtyseventh year of hi age and before that have never felt any menace or symptom of it either in hi rein side or any other part and have live till then in a happy vigorous state of health little subject to infirmity and he continue seven year after in this disease drag on a very painful end of life i be bear about fiveandtwenty year before hi disease seize him and in the time of hi most flourishing and healthful state of body hi third child in order of birth where could hi propension to this malady lie lurk all that while and he be then so far from the infirmity how could that small part of hi substance wherewith he make me carry away so great an impression for it share and how so conceal that till fiveandforty year after i do not begin to be sensible of it be the only one to this hour amongst so many brother and sister and all by one mother that be ever troubled with it he that can satisfy me in this point i will believe him in as many other miracle a he please always provide that a their manner be he do not give me a doctrine much more intricate and fantastic than the thing itself for current pay let the physician a little excuse the liberty i take for by this same infusion and fatal insinuation it be that i have receive a hatred and contempt of their doctrine the antipathy i have against their art be hereditary my father live threescore and fourteen year my grandfather sixtynine my greatgrandfather almost fourscore year without ever taste any sort of physic and with them whatever be not ordinary diet be instead of a drug physic be ground upon experience and example so be my opinion and be not this an express and very advantageous experience i do not know that they can find me in all their record three that be bear breed and die under the same roof who have live so long by their conduct they must here of necessity confess that if reason be not fortune at least be on my side and with physician fortune go a great deal far than reason let them not take me now at a disadvantage let them not threaten me in the subdued condition wherein i now be that be treachery in truth i have enough the good of them by these domestic example that they should rest satisfied human thing be not usually so constant it have be two hundred year save eighteen that this trial have last for the first of them be bear in the year 1402 ti now indeed very good reason that this experience should begin to fail u let them not therefore reproach me with the infirmity under which i now suffer be it not enough that i for my part have live sevenandforty year in good health though it should be the end of my career ti of the long sort my ancestor have an aversion to physic by some occult and natural instinct for the very sight of drug be loathsome to my father the seigneur de gaviac my uncle by the father side a churchman and a valetudinary from hi birth and yet who make that crazy life hold out to sixtyseven year be once fall into a furious fever it be order by the physician he should be plainly tell that if he would not make use of help for so they call that which be very often an obstacle he would infallibly be a dead man that good man though terrified with this dreadful sentence yet reply i be then a dead man but god soon after make the prognostic false the last of the brother there be four of them and by many year the last the sieur de bussaguet be the only one of the family who make use of medicine by reason i suppose of the concern he have with the other art for he be a councillor in the court of parliament and it succeed so ill with him that be in outward appearance of the strong constitution he yet die long before any of the rest save the sieur de saint michel ti possible i may have derive this natural antipathy to physic from them but have there be no other consideration in the case i would have endeavour to have overcome it for all these condition that spring in u without reason be vicious ti a kind of disease that we should wrestle with it may be i have naturally this propension but i have support and fortify it by argument and reason which have establish in me the opinion i be of for i also hate the consideration of refuse physic for the nauseous taste i should hardly be of that humour who hold health to be worth purchasing by all the most painful cautery and incision that can be apply and with epicurus i conceive that pleasure be to be avoid if great pain be the consequence and pain to be covet that will terminate in great pleasure health be a precious thing and the only one in truth meriting that a man should lay out not only hi time sweat labour and good but also hi life itself to obtain it forasmuch a without it life be wearisome and injurious to u pleasure wisdom learning and virtue without it wither away and vanish and to the most laboured and solid discourse that philosophy would imprint in u to the contrary we need no more but oppose the image of plato be strike with an epilepsy or apoplexy and in this presupposition to defy him to call the rich faculty of hi soul to hi assistance all mean that conduce to health can neither be too painful nor too dear to me but i have some other appearance that make me strangely suspect all this merchandise i do not deny but that there may be some art in it that there be not amongst so many work of nature thing proper for the conservation of health that be most certain i very well know there be some simple that moisten and other that dry i experimentally know that radish be windy and sennaleaves purge and several other such experience i have a that mutton nourish me and wine warms me and solon say that eating be physic against the malady hunger i do not disapprove the use we make of thing the earth produce nor doubt in the least of the power and fertility of nature and of it application to our necessity i very well see that pike and swallow live by her law but i mistrust the invention of our mind our knowledge and art to countenance which we have abandon nature and her rule and wherein we keep no bound nor moderation a we call the pile up of the first law that fall into our hand justice and their practice and dispensation very often foolish and very unjust and a those who scoff at and accuse it do not nevertheless blame that noble virtue itself but only condemn the abuse and profanation of that sacred title so in physic i very much honour that glorious name it proposition it promise so useful for the service of mankind but the ordinance it foist upon u betwixt ourselves i neither honour nor esteem in the first place experience make me dread it for amongst all my acquaintance i see no people so soon sick and so long before they be well a those who take much physic their very health be alter and corrupt by their frequent prescription physician be not content to deal only with the sick but they will moreover corrupt health itself for fear men should at any time escape their authority do they not from a continual and perfect health draw the argument of some great sickness to ensue i have be sick often enough and have always find my sickness easy enough to be support though i have make trial of almost all sort and as short a those of any other without their help or without swallow their illtasting dose the health i have be full and free without other rule or discipline than my own custom and pleasure every place serve me well enough to stay in for i need no other convenience when i be sick than what i must have when i be well i never disturb myself that i have no physician no apothecary nor any other assistance which i see most other sick men more afflict at than they be with their disease what do the doctor themselves show u more felicity and duration in their own life that may manifest to u some apparent effect of their skill there be not a nation in the world that have not be many age without physic and these the first age that be to say the best and most happy and the tenth part of the world know nothing of it yet many nation be ignorant of it to this day where men live more healthful and long than we do here and even amongst u the common people live well enough without it the roman be six hundred year before they receive it and after have make trial of it banish it from the city at the instance of cato the censor who make it appear how easy it be to live without it have himself live fourscore and five year and keep hi wife alive to an extreme old age not without physic but without a physician for everything that we find to be healthful to life may be call physic he keep hi family in health a plutarch say if i mistake not with hare milk a pliny report that the arcadian cure all manner of disease with that of a cow and herodotus say the lybians generally enjoy rare health by a custom they have after their child be arrive to four year of age to burn and cauterise the vein of their head and temple by which mean they cut off all defluxions of rheum for their whole life and the country people of our province make use of nothing in all sort of distemper but the strong wine they can get mixed with a great deal of saffron and spice and always with the same success and to say the truth of all this diversityand confusion of prescription what other end and effect be there after all but to purge the belly which a thousand ordinary simple will do as well and i do not know whether such evacuation be so much to our advantage a they pretend and whether nature do not require a residence of her excrement to a certain proportion a wine do of it lee to keep it alive you often see healthful men fall into vomiting and flux of the belly by some extrinsic accident and make a great evacuation of excrement without any precede need or any following benefit but rather with hurt to their constitution ti from the great plato that i lately learn that of three sort of motion which be natural to u purge be the bad and that no man unless he be a fool ought to take anything to that purpose but in the extreme necessity men disturb and irritate the disease by contrary opposition it must be the way of living that must gently dissolve and bring it to it end the violent griping and contest betwixt the drug and the disease be ever to our loss since the combat be fight within ourselves and that the drug be an assistant not to be trust be in it own nature an enemy to our health and by trouble have only access into our condition let it alone a little the general order of thing that take care of flea and mole also take care of men if they will have the same patience that flea and mole have to leave it to itself ti to much purpose we cry out bihore ti a way to make u hoarse but not to hasten the matter ti a proud and uncompassionate order our fear our despair displease and stop it from instead of invite it to our relief it owe it course to the disease as well a to health and will not suffer itself to be corrupt in favour of the one to the prejudice of the other right for it would then fall into disorder let u in god name follow it it lead those that follow and those who will not follow it drag along both their fury and physic together order a purge for your brain it will there be much good employ than upon your stomach one ask a lacedaemonian what have make him live so long he make answer the ignorance of physic and the emperor adrian continually exclaim a he be die that the crowd of physician have kill him a bad wrestler turn physician courage say diogenes to him thou hast do well for now thou will throw those who have formerly throw thee but they have this advantage accord to nicocles that the sun give light to their success and the earth cover their failure and besides they have a very advantageous way of make use of all sort of event for what fortune nature or any other cause of which the number be infinite product of good and healthful in u it be the privilege of physic to attribute to itself all the happy success that happen to the patient must be thence derive the accident that have cure me and a thousand other who do not employ physician physician usurp to themselves and a to ill accident they either absolutely disown them in lay the fault upon the patient by such frivolous reason a they be never at a loss for a he lay with hi arm out of bed or he be disturb with the rattling of a coach or somebody have set open the casement or he have lie upon hi left side or he have some disagreeable fancy in hi head in sum a word a dream or a look seem to them excuse sufficient wherewith to palliate their own error or if they so please they even make use of our grow bad and do their business in this way which can never fail them which be by buzz u in the ear when the disease be more inflamed by their medicament that it have be much bad but for those remedy he whom from an ordinary cold they have throw into a double tertianague have but for them be in a continue fever they do not much care what mischief they do since it turn to their own profit in earnest they have reason to require a very favourable belief from their patient and indeed it ought to be a very easy one to swallow thing so hard to be believe plato say very well that physician be the only men who might lie at pleasure since our health depend upon the vanity and falsity of their promise aesop a most excellent author and of whom few men discover all the grace pleasantly represent to u the tyrannical authority physician usurp over poor creature weaken and subdue by sickness and fear when he tell u that a sick person be ask by hi physician what operation he find of the potion he have give him i have sweat very much say the sick man thats good say the physician another time have ask how he felt himself after hi physic i have be very cold and have have a great shivering upon me say he that be good reply the physician after the third potion he ask him again how he do why i find myself swollen and puff up say he a if i have a dropsy that be very well say the physician one of hi servant come presently after to inquire how he felt himself truly friend say he with be too well i be about to die there be a more just law in egypt by which the physician for the three first day be to take charge of hi patient at the patient own risk and cost but those three day be past it be to be at hi own for what reason be it that their patron aesculapius should be strike with thunder for restore hippolitus from death to life and hi follower be pardon who send so many soul from life to death a physician boasting to nicocles that hi art be of great authority it be so indeed say nicocles that can with impunity kill so many people a to what remain have i be of their counsel i would have render my discipline more sacred and mysterious they begin well but they have not end so it be a good beginning to make god and demon the author of their science and to have use a peculiar way of speaking and write notwithstanding that philosophy conclude it folly to persuade a man to hi own good by an unintelligible way ut si quis medicus imperet ut sumat it be a good rule in their art and that accompanies all other vain fantastic and supernatural art that the patient belief should prepossess them with good hope and assurance of their effect and operation a rule they hold to that degree a to maintain that the most inexpert and ignorant physician be more proper for a patient who have confidence in him than the most learned and experienced whom he be not so acquainted with nay even the very choice of most of their drug be in some sort mysterious and divine the left foot of a tortoise the urine of a lizard the dung of an elephant the liver of a mole blood drawn from under the right wing of a white pigeon and for u who have the stone so scornfully they use u in our misery the excrement of rat beat to powder and such like trash and foolery which rather carry a face of magical enchantment than of any solid science i omit the odd number of their pill the destination of certain day and feast of the year the superstition of gather their simple at certain hour and that so austere and very wise countenance and carriage which pliny himself so much derides but they have a i say fail in that they have not add to this fine begin the make their meeting and consultation more religious and secret where no profane person should have admission no more than in the secret ceremony of aesculapius for by the reason of this it fall out that their irresolution the weakness of their argument divination and foundation the sharpness of their dispute full of hatred jealousy and selfconsideration come to be discover by every one a man must be marvellously blind not to see that he run a very great hazard in their hand who ever saw one physician approve of anothers prescription without take something away or add something to it by which they sufficiently betray their trick and make it manifest to u that they therein more consider their own reputation and consequently their profit than their patient interest he be a much wise man of their tribe who of old give it a a rule that only one physician should undertake a sick person for if he do nothing to purpose one single man default can bring no great scandal upon the art of medicine and on the contrary the glory will be great if he happen to have success whereas when there be many they at every turn bring a disrepute upon their call forasmuch a they oftener do hurt than good they ought to be satisfy with the perpetual disagreement which be find in the opinion of the principal master and ancient author of this science which be only know to men well read without discover to the vulgar the controversy and various judgment which they still nourish and continue amongst themselves will you have one example of the ancient controversy in physic herophilus lodge the original cause of all disease in the humour erasistratus in the blood of the artery asclepiad in the invisible atom of the pore alcmaeon in the exuberance or defect of our bodily strength diocles in the inequality of the element of which the body be compose and in the quality of the air we breathe strato in the abundance crudity and corruption of the nourishment we take and hippocrates lodge it in the spirit there be a certain friend of theirs whom they know good than i who declare upon this subject that the most important science in practice amongst u a that which be intrust with our health and conservation be by ill luck the most uncertain the most perplexed and agitate with the great mutation there be no great danger in our mistake the height of the sun or the fraction of some astronomical supputation but here where our whole be be concern ti not wisdom to abandon ourselves to the mercy of the agitation of so many contrary wind before the peloponnesian war there be no great talk of this science hippocrates bring it into repute whatever he establish chrysippus overthrew after that erasistratus aristotle grandson overthrow what chrysippus have write after these the empirics start up who take a quite contrary way to the ancient in the management of this art when the credit of these begin a little to decay herophilus set another sort of practice on foot which asclepiad in turn stand up against and overthrow then in their turn the opinion first of themiso and then of musa and after that those of vectius valens a physician famous through the intelligence he have with messalina come in vogue the empire of physic in nero time be establish in thessalus who abolish and condemn all that have be hold till hi time this man doctrine be refute by crinas of marseille who first bring all medicinal operation under the ephemeris and motion of the star and reduced eating sleeping and drinking to hour that be most pleasing to mercury and the moon hi authority be soon after supplant by charinus a physician of the same city of marseille a man who not only controvert all the ancient method of physic but moreover the usage of hot bath that have be generally and for so many age in common use he make men bathe in cold water even in winter and plunge hi sick patient in the natural water of streams no roman till pliny time have ever vouchsafe to practise physic that office be only perform by greek and foreigner a ti now amongst u french by those who sputter latin for a a very great physician say we do not easily accept the medicine we understand no more than we do the drug we ourselves gather if the nation whence we fetch our guaiacum sarsaparilla and china wood have physician how great a value must we imagine by the same recommendation of strangeness rarity and dear purchase do they set upon our cabbage and parsley for who would dare to contemn thing so far fetched and seek out at the hazard of so long and dangerous a voyage since these ancient mutation in physic there have be infinite other down to our own time and for the most part mutation entire and universal a those for example produce by paracelsus fioravanti and argentier for they a i be told not only alter one recipe but the whole contexture and rule of the body of physic accuse all other of ignorance and imposition who have practise before them at this rate in what a condition the poor patient must be i leave you to judge if we be even assure that when they make a mistake that mistake of theirs would do u no harm though it do u no good it be a reasonable bargain to venture the make ourselves good without any danger of be make bad aesop tell a story that one who have buy a morisco slave believing that hi black complexion have arrive by accident and the ill usage of hi former master cause him to enter with great care into a course of bath and potion it happen that the moor be nothing amend in hi tawny complexion but he wholly lose hi former health how often do we see physician impute the death of their patient to one another i remember that some year ago there be an epidemical disease very dangerous and for the most part mortal that rag in the town about u the storm be over which have sweep away an infinite number of men one of the most famous physician of all the country presently after publish a book upon that subject wherein upon good thought he confess that the let blood in that disease be the principal cause of so many mishap moreover their author hold that there be no physic that have not something hurtful in it and if even those of the best operation in some measure offend u what must those do that be totally misapply for my own part though there be nothing els in the case i be of opinion that to those who loathe the taste of physic it must needs be a dangerous and prejudicial endeavour to force it down at so incommodious a time and with so much aversion and believe that it marvellously distemper a sick person at a time when he have so much need of repose and more over if we but consider the occasion upon which they usually grind the cause of our disease they be so light and nice that i thence conclude a very little error in the dispensation of their drug may do a great deal of mischief now if the mistake of a physician be so dangerous we be in but a scurvy condition for it be almost impossible but he must often fall into those mistake he have need of too many part consideration and circumstance rightly to level hi design he must know the sick person complexion hi temperament hi humour inclination action nay hi very thought and imagination he must be assure of the external circumstance of the nature of the place the quality of the air and season the situation of the planet and their influence he must know in the disease the cause prognostic affection and critical day in the drug the weight the power of work the country figure age and dispensation and he must know how rightly to proportion and mix them together to beget a just and perfect symmetry wherein if there be the least error if amongst so many spring there be but any one out of order ti enough to destroy u god know with how great difficulty most of these thing be to be understood for for example how shall the physician find out the true sign of the disease every disease be capable of an infinite number of indication how many doubt and controversy have they amongst themselves upon the interpretation of urine otherwise whence should the continual debate we see amongst them about the knowledge of the disease proceed how could we excuse the error they so oft fall into of take fox for marten in the disease i have have though there be ever so little difficulty in the case i never find three of one opinion which i instance because i love to introduce example wherein i be myself concern a gentleman at paris be lately cut for the stone by order of the physician in whose bladder be accordingly so cut there be find no more stone than in the palm of hi hand and in the same place a bishop who be my particular friend have be earnestly press by the majority of the physician whom he consult to suffer himself to be cut to which also upon their word i use my interest to persuade him when he be dead and open it appear that he have no malady but in the kidney they be least excusable for any error in this disease by reason that it be in some sort palpable and tis thence that i conclude surgery to be much more certain by reason that it see and feel what it do and so go less upon conjecture whereas the physician have no speculum matricis by which to examine our brain lung and liver even the very promise of physic be incredible in themselves for have to provide against diver and contrary accident that often afflict u at one and the same time and that have almost a necessary relation a the heat of the liver and the coldness of the stomach they will need persuade u that of their ingredient one will heat the stomach and the other will cool the liver one have it commission to go directly to the kidney nay even to the bladder without scatter it operation by the way and be to retain it power and virtue through all those turn and meander even to the place to the service of which it be design by it own occult property this will drythe brain that will moisten the lung of all this bundle of thing have mix up a potion be it not a kind of madness to imagine or to hope that these differ virtue should separate themselves from one another in this mixture and confusion to perform so many various errand i should very much fear that they would either lose or change their ticket and disturb one anothers quarter and who can imagine but that in this liquid confusion these faculty must corrupt confound and spoil one another and be not the danger still more when the make up of this medicine be entrust to the skill and fidelity of still another to whose mercy we again abandon our life a we have doublet and breechesmakers distinct trade to clothe u and be so much the good fit see that each of them meddle only with hi own business and have less to trouble hi head with than the tailor who undertake all and a in matter of diet great person for their good convenience and to the end they may be good serve have cook for the different office this for soup and potage that for roast instead of which if one cook should undertake the whole service he could not so well perform it so also a to the cure of our malady the egyptian have reason to reject this general trade of physician and to divide the profession to each disease to each part of the body it particular workman for that part be more properly and with less confusion care for see the person look to nothing els ours be not aware that he who provide for all provide for nothing and that the entire government of this microcosm be more than they be able to undertake whilst they be afraid of stop a dysentery l they should put the patient into a fever they kill me a friend who be worth more than the whole of them they counterpoise their own divination with the present evil and because they will not cure the brain to the prejudice of the stomach they injure both with their dissentient and tumultuary drug a to the variety and weakness of the rationale of this art they be more manifest in it than in any other art aperitive medicine be proper for a man subject to the stone by reason that opening and dilate the passage they help forward the slimy matter whereof gravel and stone be engender and convey that downward which begin to harden and gather in the rein aperitive thing be dangerous for a man subject to the stone by reason that opening and dilate the passage they help forward the matter proper to create the gravel toward the rein which by their own propension be apt to seize it tis not to be imagine but that a great deal of what have be convey thither must remain behind moreover if the medicine happen to meet with anything too large to be carry through all the narrow passage it must pass to be expel that obstruction whatever it be be stir by these aperitive thing and throw into those narrow passage come to stop them will occasion a certain and most painful death they have the like uniformity in the counsel they give u for the regimen of life it be good to make water often for we experimentally see that in let it lie long in the bladder we give it time to settle the sediment which will concrete into a stone it be good not to make water often for the heavy excrement it carry along with it will not be void without violence a we see by experience that a torrent that run with force wash the ground it roll over much clean than the course of a slow and tardy stream so it be good to have often to do with woman for that open the passage and help to evacuate gravel it be also very ill to have often to do with woman because it heat tire and weaken the rein it be good to bathe frequently in hot water forasmuch a that relaxes and mollify the place where the gravel and stone lie it be also ill by reason that this application of external heat help the rein to bake harden and petrify the matter so disposed for those who be take bath it be most healthful to eat little at night to the end that the water they be to drink the next morning may have a good operation upon an empty stomach on the other hand it be well to eat little at dinner that it hinder not the operation of the water while it be not yet perfect and not to oppress the stomach so soon after the other labour but leave the office of digestion to the night which will much well perform it than the day when the body and soul be in perpetual moving and action thus do they juggle and trifle in all their discourse at our expense and they could not give me one proposition against which i should not know how to raise a contrary of equal force let them then no longer exclaim against those who in this trouble of sickness suffer themselves to be gently guide by their own appetite and the advice of nature and commit themselves to the common fortune i have see in my travel almost all the famous bath of christendom and for some year past have begin to make use of them myself for i look upon bath a generally wholesome and believe that we suffer no little inconvenience in our health by have leave off the custom that be generally observe in former time almost by all nation and be yet in many of bath every day and i can not imagine but that we be much the worse by have our limb crust and our pore stop with dirt and a to the drinking of them fortune have in the first place render them not at all unacceptable to my taste and secondly they be natural and simple which at least carry no danger with them though they may do u no good of which the infinite crowd of people of all sort and complexion who repair thither i take to be a sufficient warranty and although i have not there observe any extraordinary and miraculous effect but that on the contrary have more narrowly than ordinary inquire into it i have find all the report of such operation that have be spread abroad in those place illgrounded and false and those that believe them a people be willing to be gull in what they desire deceive in them yet i have seldom know any who have be make worse by those water and a man can not honestly deny but that they beget a good appetite help digestion and do in some sort revive u if we do not go too late and in too weak a condition which i would dissuade every one from do they have not the virtue to raise men from desperate and inveterate disease but they may help some light indisposition or prevent some threatening alteration he who do not bring along with him so much cheerfulness a to enjoy the pleasure of the company he will there meet and of the walk and exercise to which the amenity of those place invite u will doubtless lose the best and sure part of their effect for this reason i have hitherto chosen to go to those of the most pleasant situation where there be the best conveniency of lodge provision and company a the bath of bagneres in france those of plombieres on the frontier of germany and lorraine those of baden in switzerland those of lucca in tuscany and especially those of della villa which i have the most and at various season frequent every nation have particular opinion touch their use and particular rule and method in use them and all of them accord to what i have see almost with like effect drink them be not at all receive in germany the german bathe for all disease and will lie dabble in the water almost from sun to sun in italy where they drink nine day they bathe at least thirty and commonly drink the water mixed with some other drug to make it work the good here we be order to walk to digest it there we be keep in bed after take it till it be work off our stomach and foot have continually hot cloth apply to them all the while and a the german have a particular practice generally to use cupping and scarification in the bath so the italian have their doccie which be certain little stream of this hot water bring through pipe and with these bathe an hour in the morning and as much in the afternoon for a month together either the head stomach or any other part where the evil lie there be infinite other variety of custom in every country or rather there be no manner of resemblance to one another by this you may see that this little part of physic to which i have only submit though the least depending upon art of all other have yet a great share of the confusion and uncertainty everywhere els manifest in the profession the poet put what they would say with great emphasis and grace witness these two epigram and the other upon which i will relate two story the baron de caupene in chalosse and i have betwixt u the advowson of a benefice of great extent at the foot of our mountain call lahontan it be with the inhabitant of this angle a ti say of those of the val dangrougne they live a peculiar sort of life their fashion clothes and manner distinct from other people rule and govern by certain particular law and usage receive from father to son to which they submit without other constraint than the reverence to custom this little state have continue from all antiquity in so happy a condition that no neighbour judge be ever put to the trouble of inquire into their doings no advocate be ever retain to give them counsel no stranger ever call in to compose their difference nor be ever any of them see to go abegging they avoid all alliance and traffic with the outer world that they might not corrupt the purity of their own government till a they say one of them in the memory of man have a mind spur on with a noble ambition take it into hi head to bring hi name into credit and reputation to make one of hi son something more than ordinary and have put him to learn to write in a neighbouring town make him at last a brave village notary this fellow have acquire such dignity begin to disdain their ancient custom and to buzz into the people ears the pomp of the other part of the nation the first prank he play be to advise a friend of hi whom somebody have offend by saw off the horn of one of hi goat to make hi complaint to the royal judge thereabout and so he go on from one to another till he have spoil and confound all in the tail of this corruption they say there happen another and of bad consequence by mean of a physician who fall in love with one of their daughter have a mind to marry her and to live amongst them this man first of all begin to teach them the name of fever cold and imposthumes the seat of the heart liver and intestines a science till then utterly unknown to them and instead of garlic with which they be wont to cure all manner of disease how painful or extreme soever he teach them though it be but for a cough or any little cold to take strange mixture and begin to make a trade not only of their health but of their life they swear till then they never perceive the even air to be offensive to the head that to drink when they be hot be hurtful and that the wind of autumn be more unwholesome than those of spring that since this use of physic they find themselves oppress with a legion of unaccustomed disease and that they perceive a general decay in their ancient vigour and their life be cut shorter by the half this be the first of my story the other be that before i be afflict with the stone hearing that the blood of a hegoat be with many in very great esteem and look upon a a celestial manna rain down upon these latter age for the good and preservation of the life of men and have hear it spoken of by men of understand for an admirable drug and of infallible operation i who have ever think myself subject to all the accident that can befall other men have a mind in my perfect health to furnish myself with this miracle and therefore give order to have a goat fed at home accord to the recipe for he must be take in the hot month of all summer and must only have aperitive herb give him to eat and white wine to drink i come home by chance the very day he be to be kill and some one come and tell me that the cook have find two or three great ball in hi paunch that rattle against one another amongst what he have eat i be curious to have all hi entrails bring before me where have cause the skin that enclose them to be cut there tumble out three great lump as light a sponge so that they appear to be hollow but a to the rest hard and firm without and spot and mixed all over with various dead colour one be perfectly round and of the bigness of an ordinary ball the other two something less of an imperfect roundness a seem not to be arrive at their full growth i find by inquiry of people accustom to open these animal that it be a rare and unusual accident ti likely these be stone of the same nature with ours and if so it must needs be a very vain hope in those who have the stone to extract their cure from the blood of a beast that be himself about to die of the same disease for to say that the blood do not participate of this contagion and do not thence alter it wonted virtue it be rather to be believe that nothing be engender in a body but by the conspiracy and communication of all the part the whole mass work together though one part contribute more to the work than another accord to the diversityof operation wherefore it be very likely that there be some petrifying quality in all the part of this goat it be not so much for fear of the future and for myself that i be curious in this experiment but because it fall out in mine a it do in many other family that the woman store up such little trumpery for the service of the people use the same recipe in fifty several disease and such a recipe a they will not take themselves and yet triumph when they happen to be successful a to what remain i honour physician not accord to the precept for their necessity for to this passage may be oppose another of the prophet reprove king asa for have recourse to a physician but for themselves have know many very good men of that profession and most worthy to be beloved i do not attack them tis their art i inveigh against and do not much blame them for make their advantage of our folly for most men do the same many calling both of great and of less dignity than theirs have no other foundation or support than public abuse when i be sick i send for them if they be near only to have their company and pay them a other do i give them leave to command me to keep myself warm because i naturally love to do it and to appoint leek or lettuce for my broth to order me white wine or claret and so a to all other thing which be indifferent to my palate and custom i know very well that i do nothing for them in so do because sharpness and strangeness be incident of the very essence of physic lycurgus order wine for the sick spartan why because they abominate the drinking it when they be well a a gentleman a neighbour of mine take it a an excellent medicine in hi fever because naturally he mortally hat the taste of it how many do we see amongst them of my humour who despise take physic themselves be men of a liberal diet and live a quite contrary sort of life to what they prescribe other what be this but flatly to abuse our simplicity for their own life and health be no less dear to them than ours be to u and consequently they would accommodate their practice to their rule if they do not themselves know how false these be ti the fear of death and of pain impatience of disease and a violent and indiscreet desire of a present cure that so blind u tis pure cowardice that make our belief so pliable and easy to be impose upon and yet most men do not so much believe a they acquiesce and permit for i hear them find fault and complain as well a we but they resolve at last what should i do then a if impatience be of itself a good remedy than patience is there any one of those who have suffer themselves to be persuade into this miserable subjection who do not equally surrender himself to all sort of imposture who do not give up himself to the mercy of whoever have the impudence to promise him a cure the babylonian carry their sick into the public square the physician be the people every one who pass by be in humanity and civility oblige to inquire of their condition give some advice accord to hi own experience we do little good there be not so simple a woman whose gossip and drenches we do not make use of and accord to my humour if i be to take physic i would sooner choose to take theirs than any other because at least if they do no good they will do no harm what homer and plato say of the egyptian that they be all physician may be say of all nation there be not a man amongst any of them who do not boast of some rare recipe and who will not venture it upon hi neighbour if he will let him i be the other day in a company where one i know not who of my fraternity bring u intelligence of a new sort of pill make up of a hundred and odd ingredient it make u very merry and be a singular consolation for what rock could withstand so great a battery and yet i hear from those who have make trial of it that the least atom of gravel deign not to stir fort i can not take my hand from the paper before i have add a word concern the assurance they give u of the certainty of their drug from the experiment they have make the great part i should say above twothirds of the medicinal virtue consist in the quintessence or occult property of simple of which we can have no other instruction than use and custom for quintessence be no other than a quality of which we can not by our reason find out the cause in such proof those they pretend to have acquire by the inspiration of some daemon i be content to receive for i meddle not with miracle and also the proof which be draw from thing that upon some other account often fall into use amongst u a if in the wool wherewith we be wont to clothe ourselves there have accidentally some occult desiccative property be find out of cure kibe heel or a if in the radish we eat for food there have be find out some aperitive operation galen report that a man happen to be cure of a leprosy by drink wine out of a vessel into which a viper have creep by chance in this example we find the mean and a very likely guide and conduct to this experience a we also do in those that physicians pretend to have be direct to by the example of some beast but in most of their other experiment wherein they affirm they have be conduct by fortune and to have have no other guide than chance i find the progress of this information incredible suppose man look round about him upon the infinite number of thing plant animal metal i do not know where he would begin hi trial and though hi first fancy should fix him upon an elks horn wherein there must be a very pliant and easy belief he will yet find himself a perplex in hi second operation there be so many malady and so many circumstance present to him that before he can attain the certainty of the point to which the perfection of hi experience should arrive human sense will be at the end of it lesson and before he can amongst this infinity of thing find out what this horn be amongst so many disease what be epilepsy the many complexion in a melancholy person the many season in winter the many nation in the french the many age in age the many celestial mutation in the conjunction of venus and saturn the many part in man body nay in a finger and be in all this direct neither by argument conjecture example nor divine inspiration but merely by the sole motion of fortune it must be by a perfectly artificial regular and methodical fortune and after the cure be perform how can he assure himself that it be not because the disease have arrive at it period or an effect of chance or the operation of something els that he have eat drunk or touch that day or by virtue of hi grandmother prayer and moreover have this experiment be perfect how many time be it repeat and this long beadroll of hap and concurrence string anew by chance to conclude a certain rule and when the rule be conclude by whom i pray you of so many million there be but three men who take upon them to record their experiment must fortune need just hit one of these what if another and a hundred other have make contrary experiment we might peradventure have some light in this be all the judgment and argument of men know to u but that three witness three doctor should lord it over all mankind be against reason it be necessary that human nature should have depute and choose them out and that they be declare our comptroller by express procuration to madame de dura madame the last time you honour me with a visit you find me at work upon this chapter and a these trifle may one day fall into your hand i would also that they testify in how great honour the author will take any favour you shall please to show them you will there find the same air and mien you have observe in hi conversation and though i could have borrow some good or more favourable garb than my own i would not have do it for i require nothing more of these writing but to present me to your memory such a i naturally be the same condition and faculty you have be please to frequent and receive with much more honour and courtesy than they deserve i would put together but without alteration or change in one solid body that may peradventure continue some year or some day after i be go where you may find them again when you shall please to refresh your memory without put you to any great trouble neither be they worth it i desire you should continue the favour of your friendship to me by the same quality by which it be acquire i be not at all ambitious that any one should love and esteem me more dead than live the humour of tiberius be ridiculous but yet common who be more solicitous to extend hi renown to posterity than to render himself acceptable to men of hi own time if i be one of those to whom the world could owe commendation i would give out of it onehalf to have the other in hand let their praise come quick and crowd about me more thick than long more full than durable and let them cease in god name with my own knowledge of them and when the sweet sound can no longer pierce my ear it be an idle humour to essay now that i be about to forsake the commerce of men to offer myself to them by a new recommendation i make no account of the good i could not employ in the service of my life such a i be i will be elsewhere than in paper my art and industry have be ever direct to render myself good for something my study to teach me to do and not to write i have make it my whole business to frame my life this have be my trade and my work i be less a writer of book than anything els i have covet understanding for the service of my present and real convenience and not to lay up a stock for my posterity he who have anything of value in him let him make it appear in hi conduct in hi ordinary discourse in hi courtship and hi quarrel in play in bed at table in the management of hi affair in hi economics those whom i see make good book in ill breech should first have mend their breech if they would have be rule by me ask a spartan whether he have rather be a good orator or a good soldier and if i be ask the same question i would rather choose to be a good cook have i not one already to serve me my god madame how should i hate such a recommendation of be a clever fellow at writing and an as and an inanity in everything els yet i have rather be a fool both here and there than to have make so ill a choice wherein to employ my talent and i be so far from expect to gain any new reputation by these folly that i shall think i come off pretty well if i lose nothing by them of that little i have before for besides that this dead and mute painting will take from my natural be it have no resemblance to my good condition but be much lapse from my former vigour and cheerfulness growing fade and wither i be towards the bottom of the barrel which begin to taste of the lee a to the rest madame i should not have dare to make so bold with the mystery of physic consider the esteem that you and so many other have of it have i not have encouragement from their own author i think there be of these among the old latin writer but two pliny and celsus if these ever fall into your hand you will find that they speak much more rudely of their art than i do i but pinch it they cut it throat pliny amongst other thing twit them with this that when they be at the end of their rope they have a pretty device to save themselves by recommend their patient whom they have tease and torment with their drug and diet to no purpose some to vow and miracle other to the hot bath be not angry madame he speak not of those in our part which be under the protection of your house and all gramontins they have a third way of save their own credit of rid their hand of u and secure themselves from the reproach we might cast in their teeth of our little amendment when they have have u so long in their hand that they have not one more invention leave wherewith to amuse u which be to send u to the good air of some other country this madame be enough i hope you will give me leave to return to my discourse from which i have so far digress the good to divert you it be i think pericles who be ask how he do you may judge say he by these show some little scroll of parchment he have tie about hi neck and arm by which he would infer that he must needs be very sick when he be reduce to a necessity of have recourse to such idle and vain fopperies and of suffer himself to be so equipped i dare not promise but that i may one day be so much a fool a to commit my life and death to the mercy and government of physician i may fall into such a frenzy i dare not be responsible for my future constancy but then if any one ask me how i do i may also answer a pericles do you may judge by this shew my hand clutch six drachm of opium it will be a very evident sign of a violent sickness my judgment will be very much out of order if once fear and impatience get such an advantage over me it may very well be conclude that there be a dreadful fever in my mind i have take the pain to plead this cause which i understand indifferently a little to back and support the natural aversion to drug and the practice of physic i have derive from my ancestor to the end it may not be a mere stupid and inconsiderate aversion but have a little more form and also that they who shall see me so obstinate in my resolution against all exhortation and menace that shall be give me when my infirmity shall press hard upon me may not think ti mere obstinacy in me or any one so illnatured a to judge it to be any motive of glory for it would be a strange ambition to seek to gain honour by an action my gardener or my groom can perform as well a i certainly i have not a heart so tumor and windy that i should exchange so solid a pleasure a health for an airy and imaginary pleasure glory even that of the four son of aymon be too dear buy by a man of my humour if it cost him three swing fit of the stone give me health in god name such a love physic may also have good great and convincing consideration i do not hate opinion contrary to my own i be so far from be angry to see a discrepancy betwixt mine and other men judgment and from render myself unfit for the society of men from be of another sense and party than mine that on the contrary the most general way that nature have follow be variety and more in soul than body forasmuch a they be of a more supple substance and more susceptible of form i find it much more rare to see our humour and design jump and agree and there never be in the world two opinion alike no more than two hair or two grain their most universal quality be diversity
