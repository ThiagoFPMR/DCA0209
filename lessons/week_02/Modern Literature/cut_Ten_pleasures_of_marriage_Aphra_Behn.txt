to the reader courteousreader this small treatise which i here present unto thee be the fruit of some spare hour that my cogitation after they have be for a small time between while hover to and fro in the air come fluttring down again still pitch upon the subject of the ten pleasure of marriage in each of which i hope thou wilt find somthing worthy of thy acceptance because i be sure ti matter of such nature a hath never before be extant and especially in such a method neither canst thou well expect it to be drest up in any thing of nice and neat word a other subject may be but only to be clothe in plain habit most fit for the humour of the fancy if i perceive that it please thee and be not roughly or unkindly dealt withal nor braind in the nativity to spoil it generation of a further product it will incourage me to proceed upon a second part some say of the same tune but i mean to the same purpose and apparel very near the same dress in the mean time with hope that thou wilt be kind to this and give it a gentle reception from him who be thine farewell theten pleasure of marriage the nuptial estate trail along with it so many care trouble calamity it be one of the great admiration that people should be so earnest and desirous to enter themselves into it in the young sort who by their sulphurous instinct be subject to the tickle desire of nature and look upon that thing call love through a multiplying glass it be somewhat pardonable but that those who be once come to the year of knowledge and true understanding should be draw into it methinks be most vilely foolish and morrice fooles cap be much fitter for them then wreath of lawrel yet stranger it be that those who have be for the first time in that horrible estate do by a decease cast themselves in again to a second and third time truly if for once any one be through contrary imagination mislead he may expect some hope of compassion and alledge some reason to excuse himself but what comfort or compassion can they look for that have throw themselves in a second and third time they be happy if they could keep their lip from speaking and ty their tongue from complain that their misery might not be more and more burdened with scoffing which they truly merit and tho not only the real truth of this but ten time more be as well know to every one a the sun shine at noon day nevertheless we see them run into it with such an earnestness that they be not to be counsel or keep back from it with the strength of hercules despise their golden liberty for chain of horrid slavery but we see the brave spark in the very blossoming of their youth how they decay first gentlemanlike they take pleasure in all manner of noble exercise a in keep time all dance singing of musick play upon instrument speak of several language study at the best university and converse with the learnedst doctor c or els we see them before they be half perfect in any exercise like carlcats in march run mew and yawl at the door of young gentlewoman and if any of those have but a small matter of more then ordinary beauty which perhaps be get by the help of a damnd bewitch pot of paint she be immediately adord like a saint upon an altar and in an instant there be as much beauty and perfection to be see in her a ever juno venus and pallas possess all together and herewith those gentile pleasure that have cost their parent so much money and them so much labour and time be kickt away and totally abandon that they may keep company with a paint jezebel they be then hardly arrive at this intitled happiness but they must begin to chaw upon the bitter shell of that nut the kernel whereof without sigh they can not tast have no sooner obtain access to the lady but be a suddenly possest with thousand of thought what they shall do to please the sweet object being therewith so tosticated that all their other business be disperse and totally laid aside this be observable not only in youth of the first degree but also in person that have receive promotion for if he be a theologue hi book drop out of hi hand and ly stragling about hi study even a hi sences do one among another and if you hear him preach hi whole sermon be nothing but of love which he then turn wind to divinity as far a possible it can be fit if it be a doctor of physick oh he have so much work with hi own sicknes that he absolutely forget all hi patient though some of them be lie at death dore and let the chyrurgian whom he have appoint certainly to meet there tarry to no purpose take no more notice of hi patient misery and the peril of hi wound then if it do not concern him but if at last he doth come it be when the wound fester the ague in the blood or that the body be incurable so far be he concernd in look after that loveapple or nightshadow for the cure of hi own burning distemper if he be a counsellor hi whole brain be so much puzzeld how to begin and pursue the process for the obtain hi mistress in marriage that all other suit tho they be to the great detriment of poor widow and orphan be lay aside and wholly reject then be desire by hi client to meet them at anyplace and to give hi advice concern the cause he hath have such earnest business with hi mistress that he come an hour or two later then be appoint but come at last one half of the time that can be spend be little enough to make mr counsellor understand in what state the cause stand at the last meeting and then have hear what the plaintif and defendant do say he only tell them i must have clearer evidence the account well adjust and your demand in write before i can make any decision of this cause to both your satisfaction there they stand then and look one upon another not dare to say otherwise but tis very well sir we will make them all ready against the next meeting and be with grief at heart force to see as much and sometimes more expences make at the meeting a the whole concern of their debate amount to then it be come let now discourse of matter of state and drink a glass about to the health of the king the prosperity of our country and all the inhabitant which be do only to the purpose that come to hi mistress he may boastingly say my dear just now at a meeting we remember you in a glass il swear the least drop of it be so delicious to me a ever nectar and ambrose could be that the poet so highly commend if counsellor and other learn men that be in love do thus what can the unlearned notary do less even nothing els but when they be write scribble up a multiplicity of several word unnecessary clause and make long period not so much a touch or mention the principal business and if he do write it clear contrary to the intent of the party concernd by that mean make both will and other deed in such a manner that the end agree not with the begin nor the middle with either which occasion between friend near relation and neighbor great difference and an implacable hatred forcing thereby the monies of innocent and selfnecessitated people into the pocket of counsellor and attorney and alas the diligent merchant when he have get the least smatch of this frensie hi head run so much upon wheel that he daily neglect hi changetime forgets hi bils of exchange and be alwaies a post or two behind hand with hi letter so that he know not what merchandise rise or fall or what commodity be arrive or expect and by this mean buy in ware at such rate that in few day he lose yea sometimes per cent by them nay this distemper be so hot in hi head that thereby he ship hi good in a vessel where the master and hi mate be for the most part drunk and who hardly thrice in ten time make a good voyage and who know not how miserable that city and country be when a military person happen to ly sick in this hospital if he be in garison he doth nothing but trick up himself walk along the street flatter hi mistress and vaunt of hi knowledge and warlike deed though he scarce understand the exercising of hi arm i will not mention encamp in a field fortification the forming of batalions and a great deal more that belong to him and come into campagne alas this wicked loveague continue with him and run so through hi blood that both the open air and wide field be too narrow for him yea and tho he formerly have especially by hi mistris the name of behave himself like a second mar yet now hel play the sickhearted i dare not say the fainthearted to the end he may have put on hi fine knot scarf and powder periwig only go to shew himself to that adorable babe hi lady venus leaving oftentimes a desperate siege and important state affair to accompany a lame squinteyd and crookbackd jeronimo and if by favour or recommandation he happen to be intrust with any strong city or fort that be besiege he presently in fear of hi own bom and practise all sort of way and mean how he shall best make a capitulation that so leave the place he may go again to hi fair one and alas what doth not the master of a ship and hi mate hazard when they be sick of this malady what terrible cold and roar sea doth he not undergo through an intemperate desire that he hath to be with hi nittebritchd peggy how often doth he hazard hi owner ship the merchant good and hi own life for an inconstant draggletail that perhaps before he have be three day at sea hath drawn her affection from him and give promise to another yet nevertheless tho the rag wave run upon the ship and fly over hi head he withstand it all nor be the main ocean or bluster boreas powerful enough to cool hi rag fire and drive those damp out of hi brain the tempestuousness of the weather have drive him far out of hi course hi only wish and prayer be oh that he might be so happy but for a moment to see hi beacon those twinkle eys of hi dearly beloved margery mussel then all thing would be well enough tho he and all that be with him be immediately shipwrackt and make a prey for the fish and if unexpectedly fortune so favour him that he happen to see the coast oh he can not tarry for the pilot but tho it be misty weather and he hoodwinkd by venus still he sail forward run all in danger that before be so far preserve and if the shopkeeper once set foot into this destructive wilderness he doth nothing less then look to hi shop and wait upon hi customer spend most part of hi time in finical dress himself to accompany hi mistriss and with a coach or pair of oar to do her all manner of caress then hi whole discourse be with what good custom he be blest above other but seldom say that with wait upon hi lady and by indeavouring to please her above all thing how miserably he neglect it by which mean shop not only find without a master but the servant without government and at newyear the daybook be not write fair over and if any body desire their reckon the squire be so full of business that he cant spare half an hour to write it out for where he go where he stand what he think what he do all hi cogitation be imploid to think how delicious it be to press those soft lip of hi beloved and then out of an unfeigned heart to be lovd again sometimes receive a kiss thus he idle away all hi time and all hi business with hi sences run a woolgathering to be short let it be what sort of person it will they no sooner touch the shell of this marriagenut but before they can come to tast the kernel they look for they feel nothing els then thorn and briar of sorrow and misery if there be any one that think he be get a footstep far then another in the favour of hi mistriss and that in time he question not th obtain hi desired happiness immediately that imagined joy be crushd with an insuing despair be presently molest with a fear that father mother uncle or tutor will not like hi person or that he have not mean enough or els either they or the gentlewoman will make choice of another in hi place or if he see another have access to the lady as well a himself at the same moment he possess with jealousie and fall a pondering how he shall make this rival odious in the eys of her and if the other get any advantage of him then he challenge him to fight hazard in that manner hi precious life for the get of her who when he have her would perhaps occasion him a thousand torment of death and misery pray observe what pleasures this introduction impart unto u alas what may we then expect from the marriage it self really those that will take this into due consideration who would not but curse the gentlewoman that draw him into such a rag madness yet lover go forward and please your self with this imagined happiness but know that if accord to your hope you obtain her for a bride that at the least you must expect a sence and feeling of the ten insuing pleasures the first pleasure the consent be give the match conclude and the wedding kept now o lover till this time you have be indeavouring slave turmoil sigh groan hoping and beg to get from those slow and tardy lip that longwishd for word of consent you have also send many messenger to your mistriss to her parent and tutor who be as able to express themselves a the best orator but could obtain nothing yet at last that long desired word be once descend by the drawbridge of her lip like a rich cordial upon your languish heart you have vanquishd all your rival oh who can imagine your joy what you think or what you do still your thought glance upon your happiness your mistriss now will be willing denial be lay aside only thers a little shame and fear which canot of a sudden be so totally forgotten because the marriage be not yet conclude well o lover who could desire a great happiness then you now possess for what you will she will also and what she desire be all your pleasure you may now tumble in a bed of lillie and rose for all sour look be turnd to sweet smile and she that use to thrust you from her pull you now every foot to her yea those snowwhite breast which before you durst scarce touch with your little finger you may now without ask leave grasp by whole handful certainly they that at full view consider all this rightly who can doubt but that you be the happy man in the world o unspeakable pleasure but o triumphant lover let not however your joyful mind run too much upon these glistering thing be a little moderate in your desired pleasure if it might happen that there come some crossgraind obstruction for i have oftentimes see that all those suspect rose come forth with many prick thorn insomuch that the mouth which at first be salute with so many thousand kiss and appeard a if it have be coverd with the dew of heaven be compare to be the jaw of cerberus and those breast which before be the curd nacterhills and call the banket of the god i have see despise to be like stink cowsudders i and calld bad name to boot be therefore i say somewhat moderate and prudent for fear it might happen that the price of this market might fall very suddenly though perhaps not so horribly nevertheless you have great reason to be merry for this week ti hopd therel be a meeting to close up the match and it be requisite that you should go unto all the friend that must be present at the meeting to hear when their occasion will permit them and what day and hour they will appoint to set upon the business herewith you have work to traverse the city and who know whether youl find half of them at home and then those that you do find one be ready to day another to morrow a third next day or in the next week so that by this first pleasure you have also a little feeling of the first trouble which if you rightly consider be to your advantage because you may the good use your self to the following and of how great state and quality the person be whom you have choose so accordingly this trouble generally happen to be more but the mirth increase abundantly when after your indeavours trouble and turmoil you finally see all the friend meet together and you doubt not but the match will be close and agree upon but be here also a little moderate in your mirth because oftentimes the friend handle this matter like a bargaining and will lay the mony bag of each side in a balance a you may see by the plate in the mean while you may be kiss and slabber of your mistris in the next room or contrive whats to be do about the marriage and keep of the wedding but perhaps through the discord of the friend it will not be long before you be disturbd the difference oft rise so high that the sound thereof clatter through the wall into the ear of the lover for many time the portion of one be too great and whats give with the other be too little or that the parent of the bridegroom promise too little with their son and the bride parent will give too little with their daughter or els that by some subtle contract of matrimony they indeavour to make the good of each side disinherit c so that it appear among the friend a if there could be nothing don in the matter and in plain truth the parent and friend who know very well that it be not all hony in the married estate see oftentimes that it be good for these two to remain unmarried then to bring each other into misery and can find no ground or reason but rather to disswade then perswade the young folk to a marriage but tho on each side they use never such powerful argument to the young people tis to no purpose for there fire in the flax and go how it will it must be quencht for the maid think if this match should be break who know but that all the freedom that we have have with one another might come to be spread abroad and then i be ruin for ever and the young man see that hi mistris be so constant to him not hearkning to the advice of her friend be so struck to the heart with such fiery flame of love that hes resolve never to leave her tho he might fee upon bread and water or go a begging with her so that he say bargain by the contract of matrimony for what you will nay tho you would write hell and damnation i be content and resolve to sign it but think by himself with a will all this may be break and new make again hardly beleeving that this fair weather should be darkned with black cloud or that this splendent serenissimo would be obstruct by eclipse but finally there come an appearance of the desired pleasure for the knot be tie and the publick notary doth at large and very circumstantially write the contract of matrimony which be sign by both party oh heaven this be a burthen from my heart and a milstone remove out of the way heres now right matter for more then ordinary mirth all the friend wish the young couple much joy about go a health the good success of the marriage and every one wish them tubs full of blessing and house full of prosperity if evry one that wish do half but give how richly this young couple then might live yet it een help as much a it will if they get nothing they lose nothing by it and think by themselves youl in time see what it produce then if there be but one among them who be talkative and that by drink merrily the good success of the approach marriage hi tongue begin to run he relate what hapned to him at the closing of hi marriage keep of hi wedding and in hi married estate and commonly the conclusion of hi discourse be that he think at first he have the world at will but then there come this and then that and a thousand other vexatious thing which continually or for the most part of the time with great grief and trouble have keep him so much backward that it be long before he could get forward in the world well mr bridegroom you may freely tickle your fancy to the top and rejoice superabundantly that the match be conclude you have now get your leg into the stock and your arm into such desire for fetter that nothing but death it self can unloosen them and you mr bride who look so prettily with such a smirking countenance be you merry you be the bride yea the bride that occasion all this tripping and dansing now you shall have a husband too a protector who will hug and imbrace you and somtimes tumble and rumble you and oftimes approach to you with a morning salutation that will comfort the very cockle of your heart he will if all fall out well be your comforter your companykeeper your caretaker your gentlemanusher nay all what your heart wish for or the heaven grant unto you hel be your doctor to cure your palefacdness your pain in the rein of your back and at your heart and all other distemper whatsoever he will also wipe of all your tear with kiss and you shall not dream of that thing in the night but hel let it be make for you by day and may not then your bridemaids ask why should not you be merry but ala you harmless dive that think you be go into paradice pray tell me when you be go to sign the contract of marriage what be the reason that you alterd so mightily that your hand shake so verily though i be no astronomer or caster of figure yet nevertheless methought it be none of the best sign and that one might already begin to make a strange prognostication from it the event whereof would be more certain then any thing that lilly or any other almanack maker ever writ but wel let that alone for in a short time it will discover it self therefore mistress bride make you merry and since you have get your desire to be the bride before any of your bridemaids it would be unreasonable that you should be trouble now with any other business and indeed here work enough for the ordering of thing that you must trouble your head with for the bride apparel must be make and

this again no sooner have the young couple be some few day at rest and begin to see that the invitements decline but the young woman talk of go out of town together and to take their pleasure in other town and city first in the next adjacent place and then to other that ly remoter for because she never be there and have hear them commend to be such curious and neat place she hath a great mind to see oxford and cambridge yea and then she saith my dear we must go also to see york glocester and bristol and take our pleasure those way for i have hear my father book keeper often say that it be

be make there which i be a great lover of truly hony we must need go that way once that i may say i have satiate my self with it at the fountainhead ah my dear let u go thither next week it be most certain that the goodman hath no mind at all to be thus much long out of hi house from hi vocation by reason he be already so much behind hand with hi loss of time in woo wedding feasting and take pleasure but alas let him say what he will he can not disswade her from it you may as soon retort the wind a make a woman change her mind in the night she dream ont and by day she talk ont and alwaies conclude this to be her certain rule the first year wont come again if we dont take some pleasure now when shall we do it oh my dear a year hence we may have a child then it impossible for me to go

will look to our house come let u go also out of town for the first year will not come again well what shall the good man do if he will have quietness with hi wife he must let her have her will or els she will be daily tormenting of him and to give her harsh language he cant do that for he love her too well hi father also teach him this say for a marriage lesson have a care of make the first difference if he speak unkindly to her hi love might be angry and then that would occasion the first difference which he by no mean willingly would be guilty of for then these pleasure would not have their full swing well away they go now out of town but uds lid what a weighty trunk they send the porter with to the carrier for they take all their best apparel with them that their friend in the country may see all their bravery and besides all this there must be a rid gown and some other new accoutrement make for the journy or els it would have no grace now then away they go every one wish them all health and prosperity upon their journy so do i but see they be hardly ridden ten mile out of town before the young woman begin to be so ill with the horse jolt that she think the world turn topsieturvy with her oh shes so ill that she fear she shall vomit her very heart up then down light her husband to take her off and hold her head and be in such a peck of trouble that he know not which way to turn or wind himself wish that he might give all that he worth in the world to be at a good inn and she poor creature fall into a swoon make him look a if he have bepist himself though he sigh and lament excessively she hear him not which occasion him such an extremity of grief that hes ready to tear the hair off of hi head but the quamishness of her stomack beginning to decline she recovers and rise they walk for a little space softly forward the good man think with himself how he shall do to get hi dearly beloved to an inn that she may there rest her distemper body and then get her up again they ride very softly forward to get to the end of their journy truly i must confess that amongst the rest of the pleasure of marriage this be but a very sorry one but stay a little yonder me think i see the steeple we shall be there presently the little trouble and grief you have have will make the salutation you receive and the scituation of the place seem so much the pleasanter and these dainty green meadow will be a delicate refreshment youl find your stomack not only sharpned but also curiously cleanse of all sort of filthy and slimy humour and you light not sooner from your horse then your appetite be ready to entertain what ever come before you the good man in the mean while be contrive at whose house he shall first whet hi knife and where he think hi poor wearied wife will receive the best entertainment and caress to drive out of her imagination the trouble and wearisomness of her journy which will the easy be dispense with when she walk out to see the rarity of the place and to visit your cousin and relation and so much the more because every one will be wish the new married couple much joy receive them kindly and do them all manner of pleasure and civility which i assure you be no small matter of mirth but every thing must have an end it be therefore now very meet to speak of remove to some other city but let the husband say what he will of travelling by horseback she be strike on that ear with an incurable deafness they must have a coach to themselves and the great trunk must go along with them or els the whole journy would have no grace neither would it be respect enough for them in the presence of so many good friend and acquaintance unless the coach come to take them up at the dore and it must be do to here now one be return thanks for thentertainment and the other for their kind visit and withal wish the young couple that all content pleasure and delight may further attend them upon their journy c then it be drive on coachman and away fly the poor jade through the street strike fire out of the liveless stone a if pluto just at the same time be upon the flight with hi proserpina through the city but o new married couple what price do you little think this mirth will stand you at what man be there in the world that hath ever an eye in hi head but must need see that if he tarry out long this must be the ready way to brokershall yet nevertheless i confess you must do it if you intend to have any peace or quietness with your new wife these be the first fruit and pleasure of marriage therefore you must not so much a consider nay hardly think of be so long from home though in the mean while all thing there be go also the ready way to destruction for it be the fashion at such time that maid man and all that be in your service to act their own part and so merry they be that they possess their own freedom and keep open table that the whole neighbourhood hears their laughter ask the neighbour when you come home and you will quickly hear that by them be no thought of care or sorrow but that they have plaied rant and domineerd so that the whole neighbourhood rung with it and how they have play their part either with some dry baker pricklouse tailor or smoaky smith they themselves know best down go the spit to the fire the pudding pan prepare and if there be either wine beer or any thing els want though the cellar be lockt yet by one mean or another they find out such pretty device to juggle the wine out of the cask nay and sugar to boot too that their invention surpass all the stratagem that be quote by the author of the english rogue of which i could insert a vast number but fear that it would occasion an ill example to the unlearn in that study howsoever they that have keep house long and have both men maidservant have undoubtedly find both the truth and experience hereof sufficiently and how many maid in this manner have be ease of that heavy burthen of their maidenhead be well know to the whole world these be also some of the first fruit and delight of marriage but if they be of the great sort they might be esteem and approve of to be curable or a remedy find for prevention yet let them be of what state and condition they will every one feel the damage and inconvenience thereof ten time more then it be outwardly visible unto him or can comprehend for if you saw it you would by one or other mean shun or prevent it but now let it be who it will whether counsellor doctor merchant or shopkeeper the one neglect hi client suit the other hi patient the third hi negotiation trade and the fourth hi customer none of them all ofttimes know from whence it arise that their first year gain be so inconsiderable for above the continual running on of houserent the neglect and unnecessary expensive charge of servant you consume your self also much mony in travel and pleasure besides the peril and uneasiness that you suffer to please and complaite your new married mistris o miserable pleasure but you will be sure to find the great calamity of this delight as soon a you return home again if you only observe the motion of your wife for whose pleasure and felicity you have be so long from home ala she be so wearied and tired with tumble and travel up down that she complain a if her back be broke and it be impossible for her to rise before it be about dinner time nay and then neither hardly unless she hear that there be something prepared suitable to her appetite if any thing either at noon or night be to be prepare and make ready the husband must take care and give order for the do of it the good woman be yet so weary that she can not settle her self to it yea it be too much for her to walk about her chamber her very joint be a it be dislocate with the troublesomness of the journy in the mean while the servant they ly simpring giggling and laughing at one another do just what they list and wish that their mistris might be alwaies in that temper then they be sure to have the more freedom to themselves the which though do by stealth they make as bad a may be and yet hardly any man tho he have the eye of argolus can attrap them for if by chance you should perceive any thing they will find one excuse or another to delude you and look as demure a a dog in a halter whereby the good man be easily pacify and satisfy for that time and these thing be more predominant when there be a cunning slut of a maid that know but how to serve and flatter her mistris well get her by that mean upon her side in such case youl generally see two maid where one might serve or els a chairwoman the one to do all the course work the other to run of errand and lend a help hand if she hath a mind to it that all thing may the sooner be set in order she then with her mistris may go a gadding and because peggy her mistris do in this manner a it be like a jack in a box jump into each other humour the good woman may take her rest the good for she hath caretaker enough about the house and if the husband come from the change or other important affair seem to be any way discontent that all thing lie stragling about the house be not set in order presently crafty peggy find a fit expedient for it with complain that her mistris hath have such an insufferable pain in her head and in her belly that it be beyond imagination also she could get no ease for her unless she have prepare her some butterd ale and a little muld sack and this be the reason why all thing be not so ready a they ought to have be herewith the good man mouth be stopt if he begin afterwards to speak with hi wife concern thunnecessary chairwoman hi answer be prithee sweetheart dont you trouble your self with those thing leave that to me il manage that to the best advantage men have no understand about housekeep it be most proper for a woman to have the governance of her maid and also sweetheart if there be now and then occasion for a semstress or a chairwoman they be thing of so small importance that they be not worth the speaking of now if he will have peace and quietness at home this reply must give him full satisfaction and tho he be never so patient view all thing at a distance yet the maid behind hi back that their mistris may more then overhear it dare call him a tom peep in the pot or goodman busiebody and before dinner be fully do he must hear peg ask her mistris mistris wont you please forsooth to go by and by and give mistris moody a visit or discourse a little with madam elenor a long a you have nothing to do what need you ty your self to any thing pray tell her that story that the north country gentleman relate which you laught at yesterday so heartily madam elenor will admire at it and im sure she hath something that she will relate unto you herewith the good mistris begin to get a drift and away she go with peg out of dores let it go then a it will with the house keep this be also no small pleasure when the mistris and the maid alwaies agree so lovingly together then the husband need not go any more out of town to please hi wife fancy for she can now find pleasure enough by her old acquaintance sweet mistris moody and courteous madam elenor do but see now o lover what multiplicity of rose and thistle there be in the very porch of the wilderness of marriage you may think then what the middle and end must be plate folio publish by the navarre society london the fourth pleasure the wife go a pratling by her neighbour complaining of her barrenness and take physick for it verily it be a great pleasure for the new married couple that they have be up and down take their pleasure and have be feast by all their acquaintance now they have travel from place to place and take a full view of what friend and relation each other hath and see also the great difference there be in the ornament neatness manner and deportment of each place and also how pleasant the hill dale and meadow lie with their silver streaming brook but most particularly how neatly and compleatly one may for their mony be treat yet come finally to a consideration within themselves of the weakness and vanity of this pleasure perceive that all those who possess it at last conclude it burthensom and have a longing desire to be at home again in a frugal management of housekeep at their own table verily this be that happy hour of pleasure that the new married man hath be long seek for to the end he might once be free from all such idle expences and be again carefully look after hi affair and vocation now he begin to hope that all thing will come into a handsom posture also not doubt but that hi wife will have have her full swing and heart content of treat and all other sort of pleasure begin like a housewife to order her self to take some care for the concern of the family which indeed ofttimes fall out so to the great joy profit and tranquility of the good man but can it be possible that this sweet pleasure should be so disht up without some bitter sauce of discontent o kind husband if you will beleeve that then you may well think the whole state and term of your marriage to be a paradice upon earth and that you have already get foot in the highway to all fullness of pleasure and contentment yet tarry a few day and then experience will give you a good understanding of further pleasure for the new wife be no sooner come to be at quiet but she begin to complain that she can hardly addict her self to this new way of life that it appear very strange and odly to her to converse with a new maid by reason she must be tell her this thing and command her the tother and have a regard of all what she do which be thing that she before never use to trouble her self with and that it be such a trouble to her to be out of her parent house in a strange dwell place nay this ofttimes surge so high that the good man hath hi hand full of work to comfort her and to talk these foolish fancy out of her noddle and verily unless he can bridle her frivolous humour with some pleasant discourse and dry up her tear with no small number of kiss oh then hel be sadly put tot and if this all fall out well before six week be at an end therel appear another dark cloud again to eclipse this splendant sunshine for behold within a very small time the good woman begin to scrape acquaintance and get some familiarity with her neighbour which increaseth from day to day more and more nay oftentimes it come to that height shes good to be find among her neighbour then at home in her own family here she see mistris wanton play with her child that be a very pretty babe there she see mistres breedwell make ready her childbed linnens and get of her clout together yonder mistris maudlen complain that she doth not prove with child then mistres youngatit brag how nearly she could reckon from the very bedside oh then she think i have be marry this three month and know nothing at all of these thing it be with me still a if i be yet a maid what certainly should be the reason thereof this be the first occasion that beget a great disturbance in the brainpan and imagination and wo be to the good man if he doth not understand hi pywork well then to the end she may hear the good how thing go she inquire very earnestly amongst her acquaintance what caress they receive from their husband and most shamlesly relate what hath pass between her and her husband twixt the curtain or under the rose which she doth to that purpose that she may hear whether her husband understand hi work well and whether he doth it well and oft enough and also whether he be fully fit for the employ c for the verification whereof the councel of woman bring so many compleat relation that it be a shame to think much more to speak of them whosoever she speak with every one pity her and give her their advice and the best sort will at the least say to her i would oftentimes treat my husband with such sort of spice a be good for my self viz oisters egs coxcomb sweet bread lamstones caveer c and counsel him every morning to go to the coffehouse and drink some chocolate above all thing advise him to desist from tabacco and dry thing or any other thing that be too cool for the kidney and then i would many time my self by dally with him and some other pretty wanton posture try to provoke him to it whereby he should surely know that it be neither your coolness nor want of desire that might be blame in it but rather alwaies confess that you have sufficiently do your indeavour who will doubt but that she put this advice in operation o happy man who art now every foot treat with some new sort of kickshaw at your table and have free leave to frequent the coffyhouse which other woman grumble and mumble at and besides all this you find that your dear embraceth you a if you be an angel and shew you a thousand other friendly entertainment that be beyond imagination to express it be alwaies in the evening my dear come to bed and in the morning pray love ly a little long these be most certainly very great pleasure but if the woman mark that this help not and that all thing remain in the old posture then she begin to mump and maunder at her husband vaunt much of her own fitness and not a little suspect her husband oftentimes call him a fumbler a dryboots and a good man dolittle c this make him look a if he have beshit him self and though he never so much indeavours to vindicate himself and also to perswade her from the reason and example give by several learned doctor culpepper the queen midwife and some other of hi friend and acquaintance that he demonstrate unto her it be all but wind she still complain i must have a child or els i shall run distract and this manner of frantickness hath so vehemently struck into her brain that the very house seem to burn over her head insomuch that shes no sooner risen from her bed or from the table but immediately she goeth a gadding amongst the neighbour and take other people child in her arm kissing and slabbring of them so unmeasurably a if she would almost devour them with love nay she useth more simple and childish action with them then ever own mother have do by which mean the child have many time a great an affection for their neighbour a they have for their own father and mother this gad out of dores doth undoubtedly a little trouble her husband but when he begin to consider that hi wife by this mean know how to handle and make much of child and then again that she thus beforehand learn it for nothing it must of necessity be no less then a great pleasure for him and so much the more whilest she be pratling with her neighbour and playing with her child he be free from the curse of hear her sigh and complaint to have a child for shes no sooner within the dores but she talk of her neighbour child and wish with the loss of all that shes worth in the world that she have such a one too which continue alwaies so long that finally she burst out into the like former frenzy against her husband see there i must have a child also or els i shall run distract but what remedy which way he turn or wind himself he find no mean or way how to pacifie hi wife and therefore think it best himself to take thadvice of doctor and most especially with that french doctor who be so renowned for hi skill of make many men and woman that before be barren and unfruitful to conceive child insomuch that they do now every year precisely bear a young son or a daughter yea somtimes two at a time it be thereby also very necessary that the good woman her self consult with some experienced midwife and old doctresses to the end that those distemper which be the occasion of barrenness might be the good remove and take away to this end there be almost a many box and gallypots bring together as would near upon furnish an apothecary shop then to work they go with smear anoint chafe infuse wherewith a they term it the good woman be to be make fresh and fit but they make the bed and whole house so full of stink and vapour that it may be say they rather stop the good and wholesom pore and other part of the body then to open those that be stopt and cause distemper but in the conclusion we find it to be both fruitless and miserable where the good woman go to seek it by thapothecary even a her husband doth out of the oister and egshels and if this will not do now where shall the poor man hide hi head next what shall he do more to please and pacifie her he think upon all the way and mean possible to entertain her to content if she will have costly thing he will buy them for her and dissimulately saith that all what she practiseth for her content be hi only pleasure and delight yea although her pride and ambition many time in several thing fly too high and ofttimes also doth not happen to be very suitable with the constitution of the cash he dare in no wise contradict her for he fear that she will presently be at variance with him again and think in the interim whilest her mind hang upon these thing she forget her maund and mumbling for a child still hop that there will come one happy night that may crown hi earnest desire with fructivity this it be that make him that he dare not anger her or give her a sour countenance fearing that if she might have conceive that would be the mean of turn the tide to be short it be hi only and great delight to see that hi wife be well satisfied and receiveth her content and pleasure which be very hard to be practise so long a she be not with child but o what a joy there will be if he may be but once so happy a to hit that mark how will the first day of her reckoning to ly in stand in hi almanack a if it be print with a red letter well young people be content long lookd for come at last to the satisfaction of the master the fifth pleasure the young woman prove with child and long the old proverb tels u that after the sour come the sweet and i find jolly couple that it be so with you also for i hear finally that your wife be big with child well what a pleasure be that certainly now you see that all your doctoring and medicine hath be to some purpose and now you feel also that all herb be make for some good effect how happy a thing it be that you have make use of a learned doctor and an experienced midwife now be the only time to be very careful for fear the least accident might turn the tide with the young woman and so she get a mischance or some other sad mishap and a mischance be bad for her than a true childbearing for that weaken nature abundantly and oftentimes brings with it several sad consequence thus the woman talk plate folio publish by the navarre society london but you o noble champion who have behave your self so gallantly continue now to reap the further conquest of your honour look not at any small matter and most especially if you hope or desire to gain the principal prize of your pleasure for be assure that you must suffer much and see through a perspective glass all thing at a distance because you never before saw your wife in so gallant a state and condition a she now be in and therefore you must cherish and preserve her much more then formerly you have do if you hear her often grunt and groan mumble and chide either with the men or maidservant nay though it be with your own self you must pass it by not concern your self at it and imagine that you do it for the respect you bear your wife but not by constraint for it be common with bigbellied woman to do so but most especially rejoice in your self if this grunting and groan happen only by day time because then you may somtimes avoid it or divertise your self with other company yet by night generally shall the good woman be bad of all therefore be sure to provide your self well with pure aniseed clove cinamonwaters and good sack that you may therewith be ready to strengthen and assist her for it will often happen that when you be in your best and first sleep that your dear wil waken you and complain of pain at her heart of dizziness and great faintness then all what be in the house must be stir and you your self also though it be never so cold out of the bed you must with all the speed possible comfort your self herewith that this be one of the pleasure which you get with your wife though it be not set down in the contract of marriage now for this again you alwaies receive the honour that when you be invite with her to any place at a treat the best that be upon the table shall be present to the bigbellied woman yea if she long or have a desire to any thing immediately every one that observe it be ready to serve her with it nay though there be never so little in the dish her longing must be fully satisfy if no body els should so much a tast of it and by this mean oftentimes the good woman be so ill and disturb that she be force to rise from the table and fall from one faintness into another which for civility sake be then baptize that she hath sat too high or be throngd or that the room be so full the breath of the people offend her and though she perceive that this very food make her so ill yet for the most part she will be so choice and so dainty that she seldom know her self what she will eat or hath a mind to but generally it tend to some thing or other that be delicate upon this manner again accord to the former custom she tumble it in till she be sick with it and if any one look but very wishly at her immediately another say to them she must eat for two nay perhaps for three and not only that in this manner she grow so delicate and gluttonous but be thereby so easie and lazy that she can hardly longer indure her sow cushion upon her lap also sit be not good for her for fear the child thereby might receive some hindrance and an heartfullness therefore she must often walk abroad and to that end an occasion be find to go every day a pratling and gossip to this and then to another place in the mean while leave her husband without a wife and the family without a mistris then in conclusion this fall also burthensom to her a it be generally with all thing that be too frequently use then she will be for spur you up to walk abroad with her that she may get all sort of fruit and other fopperies that the season of the year affords and at the first baitingplace shes for some cream with sugar stewd prune and a bottle of sider or perry and thus abroad to spend much and at home neglect more if she have then go somthing far she be so excessive weary with it that if her life must ly at stake she can not set one foot far herewith be the poor man absolutely put to a stand ride she may not or all the fat would be in the fire and they be so deep in the country that there be somtimes neither coach nor boat to be have and if you should happen to be where a river be there never a boat to be have but if there should be one then you must be subject to humour the churlish ferry man who see the necessity of the occasion and that you be able to pay for it will have what price he please and somtimes again you be timorous your self to hazard it because many woman be very fearful upon the water but indeed if by this unhappy occasion a good expedient may be find to please your dearly beloved it be no small joy well then make your self jocund herewith to the end that other trouble may not so much molest and disturb you you may also be very well assure that your wife no sooner come to be a little bigbellied but she receive the priviledge to have all what she hath a mind to that be call longing and what husband can be so stern or barbarous that he will deny hi wife at such a time what she long for especially if it be a true love of a woman you must never hinder her of her longing for then certainly the child would have some hindrance by it forasmuch then as be necessary that you alwaies seek to avoid and prevent this you must observe that all woman when they be with child do fall commonly from one longing to another and then the providing and buying of that for them must be a great a pleasure to you a it be to them in the receiving and use of it and that not alone for theirs but your child sake also and truly he that will or can not suit himself to this humour will be very unhappy because he shall not then receive the full scope and freedom of this pleasure it be also most certain that these long desire doth transport their imagination from one finical thing to another if it be in the summer then they long for china orange sivil lemmon the large asparagus strawberry with wine and sugar cherry of all sort and in like manner of plum and these they must have their fill of and then when they have get through the continuance their full satisfaction thereof then be assure they begin to long for some great peach and apricocks and though they be never so scarce and dear yet the woman must not lose her longing for the child might get a blemish by it if then apple and pear begin to grow ripe you have the same tune to sing again for she be possess with a new longing desire as bad a if it be a quotidian ague in all the joint of her body and whatsoever come new to her sight create in her a fresh longing if she get one hour curious catherine pear pippin or russet the next she hath a mind to filberds and then an hour or two later wall nut and grape fall into her thought do what you will theres no help for it her longing must be satisfied let it go a it will or cost what it will and this her longing lead her from one thing to another of all what the

choice of or not hereby you may observe that you have a very careful wife and if you listen a little more narrowly you will hear what a special care she hath for all thing then she will every day be relate to you that amongst the number of midwife which have be recommend to her there be not one that please her for one be too young and unexperienced another be too old and dot a third be too big hand a fourth hath too much talk and the fifth drink too much wine to be short there be so many deficiency in every one of them that the good woman hath need of a learned counsellor advice to help her to chuse the best and the like trouble hath she also concern the taking of a nurse have already spend above a month time in examine among her kindred and relation and other good acquaintance how such and such nurse have behave themselves she be inform that there be few to be find but have certainly some fault or other and somtimes very great one for one be too sluttish another saunter too much a third too lazy another too dainty and then again one eat too much and another drink too much one keep company too much with the maid and another in like manner with the good man and such a one or such a one be the best but they be not very handy about the hearth to make ready some liquorish dainty thing for the good woman which be a matter of no small weight behold hath she not very great cause to be trouble and thereout you may very well also observe how happy you be see you have get a wife that night and day be busie and take care of all these concern and other affair yes verily although her bigbelly be very cumbersom to her yet she must be abroad every day from morning till even to take care and provide all these important thing that nothing may be want well what a careful wife you have how mightily she be concern for this above all other thing whatsoever and scarcely hath the good woman get these two main instrument but she find her self still involve in so much other business that she hardly can tell how to do or turn her self in it for now there want a groaning stool a screen and a cradle with what belong to it and heaven know what more which have be so long neglect with the care that be take to get a midwife and a nurse then again there want new hanging a downbed a christeningcloath silver candle stick a caudlecup c that of necessity must be buy use at the lyingin gossip

would be well for then she could begin to give order for the make clean the house from top to bottom and for the pressing of some curtain vallians and hanging the rubbing of stool chair and cupboard the scouring of the warmingpan and chamberpot and ti no wonder for when the good woman lie in then come so many busie body that with their glouring eye be peep into every hole and corner these thing do so excessively trouble her brain that she can hardly the whole day think upon any thing els yea go so near her that it oftentimes totally bereave her of her night rest insomuch that she be fain to ly very long abed in the morning and if by night she happen but only to think of boobincjo she hath immediately such an alteration in her very intrals that she feel here or there some or other deficiency which come so vehement upon her that the poor husband though it be never so cold must out of bed to fetch some cinnamon and annisseed water or good sack or els some other such sort of those liquorish ingredient and then these be the principal key of musick that the whole night through be sung and plaid upon o how happy be the good man that he hath from time to time in her childbearing

the christning and gossip feast be joyful with this till such time a the tother pleasure begin to appear the seventh pleasure the woman fall in labour behold young couple hitherto a considerable deal of time be spend and pass over with the aforesaid mirth and pleasure do not you now perceive what a vast difference be between the married or unmarried estate you have by provision make your self master of these six pleasure nay oftentimes before you have get the longdfor joy of the fourth pleasure appear that of the seventh very unexpectedly for the good woman begin to look so sour grumble grunt and groan that it seem a if she would go into the garden and fetch a babe out of the parsleybed but udslid this be a greatsurprizal for a little while ago she say that she be but seventh month go of her reckon how then should she have jest upon it or have the good woman lose her book and so make a false account yet this be the first time of her reckoning ought the more favourably to be pass by as long a the trade go forward plate folio publish by the navarre society london there now no small alarm in the watch who be there that be but near or by the hand that be not set a work oh be dorothy the semstress and jane the laundress now here what a help hand we might have of them where be now the two chairwoman also they be commonly every day about the house and now we stand in such terrible need of them they be not to be find herewith must the poor drone very unexpectedly get out of bed almost stark naked have hardly time to put on hi shoe and stockins for the labour come so pressing upon her that it be nothing but hast hast hast fetch the midwife with all possible speed and ala there be so many several occasion for help that she can not miss her maid the twinkling of an eye neither dare she trust it to the maid fetching for fear she should not find the midwife house and she hath not shew it her because she make her reckon that she have yet two month more to go therefore without denial away the good man himself must to fetch the midwife for who know whether or no she would come so quick if the maid go nay it be a question also be so late in the night whether she would come along with the maid alone because she dwell in a very solitary corner clearly at the tother end of the city for after a ripe deliberation of the good woman the lot fell so that she make choice of this grave and experienced midwife away run the poor man without stop or stay a if he be run for a wager of some great concern and though it be never so cold the sweat trickle down by the hair of hi head for fear he should not find the midwife at home or that perhaps she might be fetcht out to some other place from whence she could not come and if it should happen so we be all undone for the good woman must have this midwife or els she die neither can or dare she condescend to take any of the other for the reason afore mention but what remedy if there must come another then she will so alter vex and fret her self at it that all the provocation of pain in labour turn against her stomack and there be no hope far for that time but whilest you be run and consider in this manner hope the best rather think with your self what great joy be approach unto you if your wife thus soon come to be safely deliver of a hopeful son or daughter in the first place you will be free from all that trouble of rise in the night and from the hearing of the grumbling and mumbling of your wife two month sooner then you your self do expect you should have be be not discomfort although she doth thus unexpectedly force you out of bed before you have hardly sleep an hour for you see there great occasion fort and now be the time to show that you truly love your wife this first time will make it more accustomary the first be also commonly the bad and if you be so fortunate that at the very first you happen to meet with this prudent and grave matron midwife do bring her to your longingfor dearly beloved wife yet nevertheless you may assure your self that before you can arrive to have the full scope and heighth of this pleasure youl find something more to do for the midwife be not able alone to govern and take care of all thing that must be fetcht bring and carry to and again therefore of necessity the friend must be fetcht with all the speed imaginable viz sister wive aunt cousin and several familiar good acquaintance must have notice of it and be defraied to come to her quickly quickly without any delay and if you do not invite them very ceremonially every one accord to their degree and quality it be take to be no small affront it hath hapned more then a hundred time that the sister afterwards would not come to the christning feast because by chance she hear that the brother wife have notice give her of the childbearing before her self little consider how few people the young people have in the night to assist them or that the confusion and unexperiencedness be the occasion that they do not think of such a method or order nay oftentimes be this sort of jealousie arisen between the aunt and cousin whereby may most certainly be observe the intelligibility of the most prudent female sex ti true this running seem both troublesom and tiresom but little doth the good man know that he be now first come into that noble school herein hi patience shall be effectually exercise or that this be but the first year of try the same o how happy be they that be well instruct in it do but see how impatient the good expecting father be what be there not yet want before he hath hi lesson perfect behold the poor drone how he move too fro see what a loss and tostication he be in he trample hi hat under hi foot pull the hair off hi head not know what he would do or which way to help hi dear wife and the friend that be send for do not come so quick a he expect because the most part of them must first trick and prick themselves up before that they dare come the one fear the pierce view of another though they be all near relation and friend here he stand tremble not know which way to turn himself woman assistance be at this present most requisite and a good stierman at stern or the ship may run upon a sand she run first backwards then forward seek here then there and although he hath the key of all the chest and trunk hi head run so much a wool gathering that let him do what he will he can find no sort of those thing he most stand in need of ala all thing be thus out of order by reason the good woman do not think to come so soon in childbed oh what manner of jinkinbobs be not here want that be most useful at this occasion and the midwife cry and bawls for them that shes hoarse again heres both the groaningstool and the screen yet to be make and mistris perfect hath them both but they be lent out yonder peg the maid run her anckle out of joint and her self out of breath to desire to borrow them of mistris buyall and shes hardly get out of dores before they perceive that the warm pan be yet to be buy and that thats bad of all be that all the childbed linnen be not yet starchd or irond oftentimes it happen that it be yet upon the bankside at bleach what a miserable condition be this here the good man be at no small quandary with all the woman oh be this the great disappointment for him but presently he see all the woman countenance look very dolefully and mournfully at each other one begin to pray another to cry in there come a great alteration in the pang and pain of her labour nay they be so desperate that the fear be either the mother or the child or perhaps both must go to pot for all whatsoever the doctor hath prescribe or that hath be fetcht from the apothecary nay the very girdle of saint francis can work here no miracle uds bud this be but a sad spectacle oh say peg the maid doth this come by marry il never venture it as long a i live i do beleeve that it be very pleasurable to ly with a gentleman but the childbearing hath no delight at all in it oh i be affraid if there come not a sudden change that my good mistris will not be able to undergo it oh sweet pretty blossom a she be ti most true that here want crums of comfort both for the husband and the wife yea for the midwife and all the rest of the woman beside for they all cry that the tear run stream down their cheek and neither their cinamonwater nor burnt wine can any way refresh or strengthen her udslid if there come no other tide the sweetness of this pleasure will prove but bitter to them but hark a little there come something of a tiding that bring u five pound worth of courage with it two or three more such would make every one of our heart a hundred pound lighter and the great caudle skellet would begin to quake and tremble pray have a little patience tarry and in the twinkling of an eye you shall be present with a child and salute with the title of father the eighth pleasure the woman bring to bed ha boy after all the toil the happy hour be at last arrive that the good woman finally be deliver brought to bed well this be a mirth and pleasure that far surpasseth all the other for the good man be by a whole estate rich than he be before who can imagine or comprehend the jollity of this new father o he be so overjoyed that it be inexpressible doll and peg must out immediately to give notice of it to all the friend and acquaintance thinking to himself that every body els will be a jocund and merry at it a he be do but see how busie he be behold with what earnestness he run up and down the house to give order that the great caudle skillet may be in a readiness plate folio publish by the navarre society london what a pleasure be it for him that he see mistris doall attend the midwife and give her all manner of warmed bed and other clout the number and name whereof be without end and that mistris swifthand mistris fairarse be tumble all thing topsieturvy forsooth to seek and prepare in a readiness all those thing that be most necessary for the child but little doth he think that they do it more to be peep into every hole and corner and to have a full view of all the childbed linnen then out of needful assistance and wo be to the childbed woman if they do but find any where a clout napkin or towel that by chance hath either a hole or a rent in it for one or another of them will with grinning and laugh thrust her finger through it and then shew it to the rest taking also the first opportunity she can lay hold of when they be a little at liberty to make a whole tittletattle about it and very much admireth the carelessness and negligence of the childbed woman a if she be a great wastall and bad housewife than any of them els when to the contrary if you should by accident come into any of their garret when the linnen be just come home from wash you would oftentimes find it in such a condition that you might very well imagine your self to be in westminster hall where the colour that be trophy of honour be hang up one full of hole another tatterd torn and a third full of mildew yet notwithstanding all this peeping and snuffling in to every nook and corner they finally get the child swathled and then to the great joy of the father it must be present him in state by the midwife with this golden expression a proverb not above two hundred year old father see there be your child god give you much joy with it or take it speedily into hi bliss uds bud how doth this tickle him what a new mirth and pleasure be this again see him now stand there and look like a monky with a cat in hi arm o what a delicate pretty condition he now in well midwife look tot for this joy hath take such a tyrannical possession of hi heart that doubt not but immediately there will be a good present for you when he give it you back again ti no wonder for if it be a son he be at least a thousand pound richer then he be before though he may look long enough before hel find a banker bond in hi chest for the sum now whilest the child be swadled and drest up all the other trinkum trankums be lay aside and the table be spread neatly to entertain the friend who not alone for novelty sake but also out of a sweet toothd liquorish appetite long to see what be prepare for them and i beleeve that although the king cook have drest it yet there will be one or another of them that will be discommending something and brag that she could have make it much delicater if there be then any one that seem not fully to beleeve her immediately she cite two or three lady for her witness who have give her the great praise and commendation for her dressing of such dish above all other and who can have good judgement than they this be then a discourse for at least three hour for they be all of them so well verst in the kitchin affair that it hard for one to get a turn to speak before the other but this be an extraordinary pleasure for this new father to hear out of all their prittle pratlings how sweetly they will commend the quill that hath receive all the colchester oisters coxcomb sweetbread lamstones and many other such like thing for they have find by experience that such sort of ingredient occasion very much the kindness of men to their wife yes yes say mr luxury it be very good for my husband and not amiss for any pallate neither and im sure the good i fee my pig the good it be for me in the soucing out and this discourse then be hold up with such an earnestness and continue so long that the childbed woman almost get an ague with it or at the least fall from one swoon into another whilest there be not so much a any one that think upon her happy be the good man if he can but act the part of a ninny and hath busy himself for the most part in the kitchin then he may be now and then admit to cast in hi verdict otherwise let them talk as long a they will he be force in great misery to afford them audience but it be much good for him if accord a the occasion give opportunity there be now and then speak something concern the childbed woman or about the shaking of the sheet which be seldom forgotten because he be now already so far advanced in the conycraft of that school that he be get up to the water bucket in the mean while peg run too and again almost like one out of her sences to hunt for the nurse who dwels in a little street upon a backchamber or in an ally or some other byplace and she be just now no where els to be find but at tother end of the city there keep another gentle woman in childbed here be now again other fish to fry for one will not be without her and tother must need have her each pretending to have an equal right to her and the nurse finding that each of them so much desire her thinks no small matter of her self but that she be as wise a many a lady woman or salomon cat and that her fellow be hardly to be find but before some few day be past there a great trial to be make of the nurse experience and understanding for let them do what they will or can the child will not suck yea and whats worse it hath get a lamentable thrush ala a day what bad work be here again the nurse be so quamish stomackt that she can not suck her mistres therefore care must be take to find out some body or other that will come and suck the young woman breast for twelve penny a time or els her breast will grow hard with lump and fester for want of be draw or els also with the suck she get in the tipple now be the right time to fetch the apothecary to make ready plaisters and bring fennelwater to raise the milk that the lump may be drive away and most especially that the clove in the tipple may be cure help now or never good mr doctor for if this continue much longer the young woman perhaps get an ague that may then cost her her life verily in this state and condition of the woman be also some pleasure to be find for you may keep your wife now very cheap she be not now so liquorish and sweettoothd a when she be with child which in deed be very good at all time but most especially in this pittifull time for there now nothing fitter for her to eat then a little good broth stewd prune caudle watergruel roast apple or new lay egs but now father your pleasure will immediately be augment for it will not be long before you will have some or other gentlewoman come to give you a visit who will then also out of their closet of understand be very much assistant to you with their advice and counsel for there be very few of them that be not deeply experience in sir thomas brown midwivery and if any thing do happen more then ordinary they never want for remedy now there be doctor needhams wife who by her own experimenting hath knowledge of several other thing but upon such an occasion a this there be nothing well then that the child must be glisterd and for the lump you must indevour through a continual chafing to get them out of the young woman breast but mistris rattlepate relate how miserably she be trouble with an humour in her breast when she lay in but that she have alwaies cure her self of it by only take a sandwich carrot and scrap it hollow in the inside and then put like a hat upon the tipple this draw out all ill humour without any pain or the least fear of danger yes truly saith mr talkenough i do indeed forsooth beleeve that that be very good but here be very sore nipple and they begin to be chopd and there must be a special care take for that therefore it will not be amiss to strengthen the nipple with a little aqua vit and then wash them with some rosewater that hath kernel of limons steepd in it theres nothing like it or good i have lie in of thirteen child but never try any thing that do me so much good or give me half the ease pray dear mistris be sure to make use of that you will never repent it but mistris knowall saith that she hath make use of this also and find some ease by it and that she hath try above an hundred other thing that be approve to be good yet of all thing never find nothing under the sun that be more noble then salvator winter salve for that cure immediately and you can have nothing well yet mistris stand tot begin to relate wonderful operation do with oyl of myrrh and of the plaisters that be make by the gentlewoman in pyyard now come the sage matron experience say that she hath learnt a secret from a prudent doctor thats worth it weight in gold nor can the vertu thereof be too much commend and she hath already communicate it unto several person but there be none that try it who do not praise it to be incomparable therefore she hath be very vigilant to note it down in s john pain and nicculpeppers work to the end that her posterity may not only make use of it but participate it to other this be lapis calaminaris prepare mingle with a small quantity of maybutter and then temper them together with the point of a knife upon an earthen plate just a the picture drawer do their colour upon their pallet which will bring it to be a delicate salve and be also very soft and supple for the chop of the tipple nay though the child should suck it in yet it doth it no harm and it doth not alone cure them but prevent the come of any more yes saith mistris consent to all and my advice be then to take a little horn with a sheeps udder lay that upon the tipple for that defend them and occasion their curing much well and sooner o what a pleasure it be to hear all the pretty consideration of so many prudent doctresses if clement marot might but revive i be sure he would find here a many doctresses a ever there be doctor at paris but o how happy will this fortunate new father be when he may but once see the backside of all these grave and nice doctresses but my truth this may very well be registred for one of the most accomplished pleasure but yet all this doth not help the young woman perhaps all these remedy may be good saith the grandmother but they be not for our turn for ala a day the very smell of salve make her fall into a swoon neither can she suffer the least motion of suck for the very pain bereave her of her sences what shall we do then to keep a wetnurse be both very damageable and cruel chargeable for wetnurse be generally very lazy and liquorish and they be ever chat and chaw something or other with the maid and in their manner they baptize it with say it be very necessary wholesom for the child and then again to put the child out to nurse hath also several consideration first it estrangeth much from you and who know how ill they may keep it therefore it be best to keep it at home and indeavour the bringing of it up with the spoon feed it often with some pure and cordial diet fit for the appetite and now and then give it the suck bottle but what remedy now this be all to no purpose for though the grandmother nurse and ant do what they can yet all their labour lose and the child be so froward and peevish that the nurse be ready to run away from it nay though she dandle and play with it alwaies till past midnight it be but wash the blackamore in so much that a wetnurse must be seek for or away go the child to limbo for this again be require good advice and the chusing of a good one hath it consideration but the tender heartedness and kind love that the mother hath for her child can no way suffer this she will rather suck it her self though the pain be never so great yet have try it again a second time the pain be so vehement that it be impossible to withstand it therefore the new father can not be at quiet till there be a wetnurse found and brought to them for it go to the very heart of both father and mother to put the child out to nurse and do but see after much seek and diligent inquire the new make grandmother hath at last found one who be a very neat cleanly and mighty modest woman her husband go a little while ago to the eastindies her child die lately this be no small joy but an extraordinary pleasure both

this first string till the childbed woman begin to enter upon the relate what great pain in travel she have to fetch this child out of the parslybed what a difference there be between her and other of her acquaintance c thereout every one hath so much matter a would make a longwinded sermon and the conclusion generally be the relate how and when the good man crept to bed to her again and how such a one have be a fortnight with child before she go to receive her churching where upon another come with a fullmouthd confession that her husband be not half so hot do but tarry a little yet till the

that hi wife be so reasonable strong again and that she be so neatly trickt up sit in state in the best furnished room by the bedside o what a pleasure this be o how he treat all the woman with delicate marget ale and sack and sugar unless he begin to bethink himself and for respect sake or frugality set some bottle aside because he perceive it to be nothing els but a vast expence and womens

handle by the midwife that no tongue can express it insomuch that master peepin the man midwife be fain to be fetcht to assist with hi instrument it be a very great wonder that the woman ever escape it which be most lamentable indeed to be relate and too sad indeed to be place by me among the pleasure of marriage in the mean time at the tother end of the chamber mistris fairtail relate a pretty story how their maid be very curiously stitcht up by their tailor and how she be every foot run thither then to have a hole finely draw that she have tear in her petticoat another while to have her bodice make a little wider and then again to have her stockins sole it be no wonder saith mistres paleface that this should happen to a poor innocent servant maid there be my husband first wife niece mr youngrose that modest virgin she keep such a close conversation daily communication with master scure that at last there appear a little cupid with little ear and short hair nay then saith mistris lookabout those two sister need not twit one another in the teeth with it for the tother keep such a sweet compliance and converse with the spanish fruiterer yonder at the cornerhouse where she do eat so many china orange and other watrish fruit that they cause her to get an extraordinary swelling under her stomack which doctor stultus judge to proceed from some obstruction wind and other watrish humour but it do not continue so long before her mother begin good to apprehend the nature of her distemper send her away to her countryhouse at hackney mistris lookabout be go to begin again but they hear such rapping and knocking at the dore that one of them say i beleeve there be our husband and indeed she guest very well this augment their mirth mightily and especially of the nurse for now she be sure that if the good cully her master treat hi gossip nobly and liberally her present would be double but nurse do not cheat your self for fear it might happen otherwise i know once a merry boon companion who be at a gossip feast call the nurse alone to him and say to her nurse il swear you be very vigilant and take a great deal of pain in serve both u and our wife with all thing and also filling of u full glass and bowl hark hither my wife be a little covetous and ofttimes so narrowsould that she doth not keep her credit where she ought to do so that i beleeve her gift will not be very great and truly because you be such a good body see there thats for you put it some where privately away therewith thrust her an indifferent great brass counter wrapt up in a paper into her hand the nurse certainly beleeving this to be at the least a crown piece thanks him very demurely and put it in her pocket never open it till they be every one of them go but then she saw that she be basely cheat but nurse you be warn now by this another time you may look good tot yet methinks id fill about lustily it be the good man of the house hi wine and when the wine begin to surge crownhigh the men be much more generous than before and verily methinks i have a mind to take my portion of it also but yet not so a the nurse do at my neeces who have tossd up her bowl so bravely upon the good health of the childbed woman her mistriss that when she be go to swathe and fee the child instead of put the spoon into the mouth she thrust it under the chin sometimes against the breast and then when she be about swathing of it a it be commonly the custom to lay a wollen blanket and linnen bed together she wrapt the poor infant with it little naked body only in the blanket alone o thrice happy young father who have hitherto so nobly treat and entertain all your she gossip and have the audience of all their curious relation now you will have the honour also of entertain their husband your hegossips who will not be backward in do of you reason out of the great bowl you will set before them and talk a freely of a pycorner merchandize who be there now that doth not praise and commend your manful deed to the high ha ha saith master laugh wel thats a child who ever saw a braver theres not the fellow ont o my dearest i have such a delight in this child that if we be but a little alone together id cast you such another a if it be of the same mould stay a little stay a little saith master fillup it may be you would not run so strong a course yet i saw once two souldiers who be batchelors that be sit in an evening drinking in an alehouseand talk lustily of the bobbinjo trade whereupon one of them say cocksbobs jack if i have but a wife as well a another id presently get her with child of a brave boy ho ho saith the tother it be an easie thing to get a wife if one seek it if i would i dare lay a wager ont i would be the bridegroom within the space of two hour the other not beleeving him they lay a wager between them for a bottle of wine hereupon one of them go out of dores just upon the striking of the clock hardly be go a street length before he meet with a bonny bounce girl who be go of an errand for her mistris and he presently lay her on board but she seem to be very much offend that an honest maid go about her business in the evening should be in this manner so encountred by a strange fellow with a sword by hi side verily sweetheart say he you have a great deal of reason in all what you say but you may certainly beleeve that it be an honest person who speak to you and only seek an occasion to be acquaint with a virtuous good conditiond maid my wearing of a sword be because i be a souldier and be very well know by many honest people and truly if you please to admit me this favour you shall see and find me to be an honest man and none of those that go about to ly and deceive any body and indeed my intention desire be to marry to that end seek nothing but an honest maid and i doubt not but that i have at this time find one to my mind and go forward with hi chat in these sort of term but the maid deny him say that she have no mind atall to a souldier because it be one of the poor and miserable sort of levelihoods their pay be but very little and they be seldom advanced c he on the other side commend approve a souldiers life to be the merry resolutest absolute easy of any that be under the sun because that neither hungrie care nor finical pride do any way take place by them but that they on the contrary be alwaies merry never admit sorrow into their thought ti true say he our pay be but small but then again all what the country people have be our own for what we want our self we get from them we never take care for to morrow have alwaies something fresh every day new mirth rich sweetheart doth not consist in multiplicity of good but in content there no one well satisfy than a souldier therefore you shall alwaies see an honest souldier look plump and fat just a i do but drunkard and whoremaster fall away miserably c in short the maid begin a little to listen to him and so much the more because that very morning she have a fall out with her mistris and tell him she would take it into consideration he answer her again what a fidle stick why should we spend time in thinking we be equally matcht a souldier never think long upon any thing but take hold of all present opportunity and it generally fall out well with him but she draw back a little he saith ah my dear you must take a quick resolution behold there yonder come a cloud driving towards the moon il give you so much time till that be past by therefore be please to resolve quick for otherwise i must go seek my fortune by another for a soldier neither woos nor threaten long upon this she consider a little but before the cloud be past by the moon she give him her consent and he give her hi tobaccobox for a pledge of marriage and desire something of her in like manner for a pledge but she say she have nothing howsoever he persist so strongly that in conclusion she give him her garter for a pledge of marriage he be content with it and take hi leave go unto hi comrade and tell them what have hapned to him shew them the garter whereupon he that have lay the wager with him askt who it be what her name be and where she dwell c and be tell by another that it be a handsom neat and very well complexiond maid by my troth say he i wish i be to give four can of wine that i could light upon such another well see there saith the first if you will give four can of wine i will both give you the garter the maid too into the bargain it be do but by moonlight so that shel hardly know whether it be me or another hereupon the agreement be conclude the two first can of wine be spend and the garter be deliver to him and every one charge to keep it secret this second souldier go to the maid next day in the evening at the hour and place where they have appoint to meet and there relate to her several passage that be pass between them the day before and shew her the garter make her beleeve that he be the person that have contract with her the day before to be short the maid leave her service and marry him and that which be most to be observe be that that which the first souldier vaunt to have do the second performed for just nine month after they be marry she be bring to bed of a gallant young boy and they live very peaceably and quietly together well il vow saith master crossgrain thats a very notable relation it be well a great deal that the business happen so then like another which be just contrary that i shall make mention of to you barebeard and mally who by a sudden accident without much wooing be get together and their first bane of matrimony be publish but fall out they call one another all the name that they could reap together nay it run so high that they would discharge each other of their promise and resolve to go to the bishop crave that they might have liberty to forbid the bane themselves which hapned so barebeard come then with mall before hi grace complain that he do already perceive hi intended marriage would never come to a good event because he find perfectly that this maid be a lumpish jade a nasty slut a scolding bawling carrion a restless peece of mortality therefore it might go a it would he do not care for the maid neither would he marry her and for those reason he desire hi grace to grant that the bane might be forbid a think it much well for him to quit her betimes before it be too late she on the tother side say that he be one that run gad along the street at all hour of the night a private drunken beast a spendthrift c so that she do not care for him neither whereupon hi grace smile tell them well you fellow and wench do you think that we do here so give and take away the consent of marriage perhaps when you be marry it may be much good for the marriage bed doth for the most part change the ten sences into five but she answer may it please your grace he be no such man to do that for all that he can do be only tofollow hi own roundheadlike stiffneckedness and een nothing els whereupon he again answer may it please your grace i have no mind ever to try it with such a creature a she be i should be then fast enough bound to her neither would i willingly go alive headlong to the devil to take my habitation in hell the bishop thus perceive that no good thread could be spin of such sort of flax cause the bane to be forbidden then say barebeard may it please your grace be i not a freeman may i not marry with whom i please or have a mind to to which hi grace answer yes presently barebeard thrust hi head out at the dore call out aloud peg do you come hither now and beg that hi grace would be please to give him leave to marry with this person which mall see she cry out you rogue you have be too cunning for me in this if i have the least thought ont i would have have my hal to have tarry for me at this dore instead of tarry for me at another place whereupon hi grace be in great ire chide them most shrewdly give them such strong reproof that at first it might very well be imagine that he would never have admit of a second consent yet afterwards upon consideration it be grant but barebeard be now marry with peg they get no child and mall be marry to hal they have both a son and a daughter at one birth by which it easie to be observe what acquaintance mall have make with barebeard before hand why she would rather marry with hall then with him to this again mistris sweetmouth relate that she have be several time invite to mistris brave labour and that she have be twice bring to bed very happily of two delicate twin and in the last encounter for a recompence of the affection of her beloved she present him with two lustly and gallant boy but because she would equally balance hi great bounty the midwife take the same walk again for another and finding in what condition thing stand she call for a bason of warm water bring out at last a most delicate pretty daughter that be yet poor thing wrapt up in the cawl which she immediately lay into the warm water and shew unto them all the wonderful work of nature for there they could see it move and stir a if it have be in it mother glass bottle but the skin be just cut open with a small hole it begin presently to make a little noise like a weak childish voice which indeed be very rare pleasant to be see in truth such a father who can cast every time such high doubblets may very well be call by the name of brave but this story be hardly tell before mistris tittletattle pursue it with another out of the same text say a little more then two year ago i be at a gossip by mistris gay who be then bring to bed both of a son and a daughter also at one birth but indeed the labour come so violently upon her that a she be stand upon the stair not be able to set one foot far and have neither midwife nor any other woman of her neighbor and friends only the assistance of her husband and the maid she be immediately deliver of two gallant child but they do not live long upon my word say mistris bounceabout it be an excellent help when men understand their travelling upon such sort of road it hapned to me once that some gentlewoman be merry with me somewhat late in the evening and because i have have several symptom of labour say this mistris bounceabout if you would now take a walk to the parsley bed we would help you very bravely but neither wind nor weather be serviceable at that time but they have hardly be go an hour and be in bed with my husband and he very fast asleep before there begin such an alteration of the weather that my husband must up with all speed who waken the maid and send her for the midwife laying on fire himself in all hast yet do all what they could within less then a quarter of an hour and that without any body help but my husband my journy be perform but thing be do with such a confusion that he receive the child in the christning cloath instead of the blanket and a thousand more such story a these be ript up that would burthen the strong memory to bear them and so much the more because it be impossible to distinguish one from the tother when the men and the woman that gabble so one among another and ofttimes they spin such course thread of bawdery in their talk that be enough to spoil a whole web of linnen and who can tell but that their tattling would last a whole night for there hardly one of them who hath not at the least a hundred in their budget but because it be high time that either the dry or wetnurse must go to swathe the child they begin to break off and shorten their prittleprattle now young father do but observe what fine airy complement will be present to you at their parting every one thanks you for your kind and cordial entertainment and not one of them forgets to wish that you may the next year either have a daughter to your son or a son to your daughter imagining then that all thing be well when you receive such a full crop but i be most apt to beleeve that all their wish aim at the but of come next year again to the gossip feast to toss up the gossipsbowl and in telling of a bobbinjo story they peep into all nook and corner well o new father this pleasure begin to come to a conclusion but prithee tell me would not a body wish for the get of such another that hi wife might make a journy to the parslybed twice a year now nurse have at you you shall now reap the fruit of all your running and go early late to invite them oh think she by her self would but every shilling change it self into a crownpeece but nurse youl hardly be trouble with a fit of that yellow jaundies sickness for theres no drug at the apothecary nor any louse among the beggar that can cure you of it and i dare say nurse that youl go nigh to perceive that it a very hard time and mony mighty scarce because formerly the woman use to put their hand more liberally in their purse and one give a crown another half a crown but the time be now so strangely alter that they keep little mildshillings only for that use nay some of them rub it off with a couple of their grandams gray groat but howsoever i hope for your sake it will not be here accord as often happen fair promise but no performance for if it should i protest ye ought to have make your bargain to have have a peece more at the least for your nurse keep or otherwise you must have have the full liberty to toss up the remains of all that be leave in the gossip bowl or els to have carry the key of the wine cellar alwaies in your pocket and then after the feeding and swathe the child you might in the twinkling of an eye swinge up a lustly glass upon the good health of the father childbed mother and the child for the wine be lay in to be make use of to that end and purpose and it be commonly know that the nurse be not so mealy mouthd for although they dont do it that every one should see it theyl be sure with the maid to get their share in one corner or other but you must for this again think that the freer you let them take their swing herein the more care they will take for the child now nurse dont spare to make good use of your time for it belong amongst other thing to this pleasure and the new father will nevertheless be turn about to another mirth and then you may be sure to expect to have a god be wye therefore make much of your self and toss up your glass stoutly at the winecask who know whether you may have the opportunity this twelve month again to meet with such a good nursekeeping a liquorish sweettoothd childbed woman a plentiful housekeeping be not every where and you may certainly beleeve that the month will be no sooner end then that youl begin to stink here for the mistris will begin to consider with her self that she can make a shift with the maid and wetnurse so that then you must expect to get your undesired pas then you must return back again to your own lodging that dark moist and mournful cell and satisfie your self if you can get it with a mess of milk and brown george or some such sort of lean fare so that youl have time enough to wast away that fulsomness and fogginess of body that you have get in your nursekeeping for theres no body that will give you any thing or think in the least upon your attendance unless they want you again o new father pray for it to come again within a twelve month that you may have a renewing of this pleasure once more for it be with the nursetaking it leave and will conduct you to a follow the tenth pleasure a great childbed feast be keep and the child put in cloaths oh how pleasant be thestate of married people above that of batchelors and maid how it distribute mirth and pleasure verily one may in some measure recogitate or write something of it but it be impossible to imprint so sunlike a splendor in potter clay or to display it with the most curious colour though the accomplishedst painter might have draw it very near the life yet it would be but a dead draught in comparison of the reality and experience that be find in it self you have already see here nine part or table but it be not ninety picture that can sufficiently shew you the ful of one of the nine part be therefore chearfully merry o sweet couple because you be in so short a time arisen to the height of be possessor of all these pleasure and so much the more the ninth be hardly past before the tenth follow a it be tread upon the heel of the tother plate folio publish by the navarre society london they have scarce wipe their mouth or digest the childbed wine in their stomacks before there start up a new day of mirth jollity for now there must be a childbed feast keep the child must be put in cloaths o what two vast pleasure be these for the young father ti indeed too much joy for one person alone to be possessor of at first you have the pleasure for to treat the woman those pretty pleasing creature and to hear all their sweet and amiable discourse but now you shall be honour with treat the matron like midwife and those men and woman that be your kind friend and near relation yea and the godfather and godmother also who will all of them accompany you with courteous discourse and pleasant countenance they will begin a lusty bowl or thump glass super naculum drink it out upon the health prosperity of you your bedfellow and young son and very heartily wish that you may increase and multiply at least every year with one new babe because that they then might the good come to the childbed feast here youl see now how smartly theyl both lick your dish and toss your cup and glass off begin you only some good health a pray god bless hi majesty and all the royal family the prosperity of our native country all the well wishers of the city welfare c and when you have do theyl begin and about it go to invest you with the honour and name in a full bowl to the father of the family well be not that a noble title such a pleasure alone be worth a thousand pound at l and whilest the men be busie this way the good woman with the other woman be contrive on the other side how the child ought to be put in cloaths upon the best and modish manner for she be resolve to morrow morning to be churchd in the afternoon shel go to market she accomplish the first well enough but be at a damnable doubt in the second part of her resolution for by the way in the church and in the street she hath continually observe several child and the most part of them dress up in several sort of fashion some of them she hath a great fancy for but then she doubt whether that be the new mode or not one seem too plain and common which make her imagine in her thought thats too clownish but other stand very neat and handsom ti true the stuf and the lining be costly and very dear but then again it be very comly and handsom and then again she think with her self as long a i be at market id a good go through stirch with it and make but one pay for all it be for our first and but for a little child not for a great person therefore it be well to take that which be curious and neat the price for make be all one besides it will be a great pleasure for my husband when he see how delicately the child be drest up and hi mony so extraordinarily well husband now my dear pray be you merry if the stuf hath cost somthing much you have need but of little and it be for your first when it grow big or that you get more you must part with much more mony dont grudge at this for once because then you would spoil all your mirth and pleasure with it rejoice that you have a wife who be not only good to fetch child out of the parsley bed but be also very careful to see them well nourished and neat and cleanly cloathd you your self have the praise and commendation of it let her alone a while for woman must have their will say but little to her for her brain be too much busy already and it may be that in three hour time you would hardly get three word of answer from her and suppose you should relate somthing or other to her this shall be your answer from her at last that she do not well understand you because all her thought nay her very sences do a it be glide to again one among another continually to order the dress up of her child i be very well assure o new invest husband that your wit at present run a woolgathering because that both merchandize and trade be neither of them so quick a you would fain see them and by reason of this tedious and destructive war monies be horrible scarce nothing near so plentiful a you could wish it to be but comfort your self herewith that it hath hapned ofttimes to other will yet also happen oftner to you yet this be one of the least thing but stay a little to morrow or next day the nurse go away this seem to be a merriment indeed for then youl have an eater a stroygood a stufgut a spoilall and prittlepratler less than you have before you be yet so happy that you have a wetnurse that carefully look after the child by which mean both you and your wife be free from toss and tumble with it in the night whilest other on the contrary that have no wetnurse in their house begin first to tast when the drynurse go away what a pleasure it be that the child must be set by the bedside and the charge thereof leave unto both father mother when it oftentimes happen that the good woman be yet so weak she can neither lay the child in nor take it out of the cradle insomuch that the father here must put a help hand tot because he be of a strong constitution and hath the great share in it by my faith such a those be they who have the first and true tast of the kernel of the tenth pleasure because the husband ought a then out of a tender affection for hi wife to rock continually that she might take her rest otherwise she would not get any suck in her breast for the child and happy they be somtimes if they come off with but rock the most part of the night for many time it happen that the child be so restless and unquiet that father mother maid nay and all whatsoever be in the house must out of their bed to quiet it and though they use a thousand trick and stratagems yet all to no purpose and yet this be but a small matter for them neither for before a few month be past the child begin to get teeth and bawls and cry so night day that they can tell the clock all the night long wish a thousand thousand time over that they might see daybreak and so by the comfortable assistance of daylight receive a little solace for all their toiling and tumble too and again yet i would advise such a these that they must in no manner be discomfort at this if they intend to demonstrate that they have learn somthing in the school of marriage to exercise their patience but on the contrary to shew themselves content with all thing be assure that hereafter when all this trouble be past they shall receive the happiness that the child will return them thanks with it pretty smile and in time also will salute them with a slabber cocurring and i beleeve now that they clearly find that all thing do not go so even in this world a they well imagined and that the fair sunshine of marriage may be somtimes darkned with a cloudy storm you marry people that have the help of a wetnurse receive a much great advantage in participate of the pleasure of marriage neither need you to be trouble with toss dandling of the child in the night o young housefather this be a most incomparable pleasure for you for now you may most certainly see the approach of a daughter to your son and by that mean reap the possession again of all those former pleasure by every one be salute with the title that you be an excellent good artist if it be so be careful that you do not gad up and down with your wife too much on horseback or in coach for fear it might make her miscarry but you have learn all these thing well enough at the first and without doubt have keep them well in remembrance do but behold in the mean time what an unexpressible pleasure your dearly beloved hath in the trick up of her sweet baby in the most neat dress what a world of pain she take spend her spirit to make the tailor understand accord to what fashion she will have it make to hasten him that all thing may be ready and totally finisht against sunday next o new father now open your eys behold what a pretty son you have how happy you be in so loving and understand a wife that know how to trick it so curiously up in this manner she be never good please undoubtedly the summer night be too long and the day too short for her to gad up and down traverse the street of the city that she may fullfill her desire of shew it to every body never be any thing more neatly drest but the nurse and the maid with the child in the mean while at jericho for their very back and side seem to be absolutely break with carry it up down from day to day and most especially when the child be weand and the wetnurse turnd away the maid can not let it penetrate into her brain that she now not only the whole week must rock sing dandle dress and walk abroad with it but that she be upon sunday also bind to the child like a dog to a halter and never can stir out a she formerly do to walk abroad with giles the baker or john true the tailor nor so much a go once to give a visit to her countryfolk or kindred which occasion no small difference between the maid and the mistriss but good house father never trouble your self at it for this belongs also to the pleasure of marriage nor do not seem discontent because your dearest walk abroad thus every day but rather think with your self she take her spin wheel and reel along with her and if in her absence you have not that due attendance nor find that in the house and kitchin thing be not so well take care for why then you must imagine to be satisfy with thassistance of the semstress or some such sort of person as well a you be when you enjoied the eighth pleasure you must also observe that if the child should sit much it might get crook leg and then the sweet babe be ruin for ever it be also too weak yet to be any way roughly handle but it begin from day to day to grow strong and strong also with your dear carry it abroad continually to visit all your friend and acquaintance it learn by degree to eat all thing and drink not only beer but some wine too and i assure you it be no small pleasure for the father and mother to see that this little young gosling can so perfectly distinguish the tast of the wine from the tast of the beer tho when it be come to some elder year perhaps they would give a hundred pound if they could but wean it from it but thats too far to be lookt into and care too soon take make people quickly grayheaded before you reach this length yea perhaps before some few week be at an end you will see this sweet babe afflict with either the measels or small pox and then youl wish for a good sum of mony that he might not be disfigure with them in have many pockholes and it be no wonder for who know whether he may be past smallpocking and measeling when he be five twenty year of age but on the contrary there may then perchance appear so many glimps of marriage pleasure from him that such small thing will not be once lookt at for if your wife be now upon a new reckoning and you come then a i have tell you before to get a daughter you will in time see what a pretty sweet gentlewoman shel grow to be how modestly orderly she go to learn to write and read but most especially to prick sample which perhaps shel be wholly perfect in before she hath half learnt to sow nay it probable that shel be an artist at the making of bonelace though she be never teach it otherwise both you her mother will reap an extraordinary pleasure in see your daughter grow up in all manner of comly and civil deportment and that she begin to study in the book of french manner and behaviour and know also how to dress up her self so finically with all manner of trinkum trankums that all the neighbouring young gentlewoman and your rich neeces esteem themselves very much honour with the injoiment of her company where they follow the example of their predecessor do by degree instruct one another in the new fashion fine flanders lace the difference and richness of stuff the neat cut gorget and many more such jincombobs a these nay and whats more they begin also to invite and treat each other like grave person accord a the opportunity will allow them first with some cherry and plum then with some filbuds and small nut or wallnuts fig and afterwards with some chesnuts and new wine or to a game at card with a dish of tee or els to eat some pancake and fritter or a tansie nay if the coast be clear to their mind to a good joint of meat a sallad till at last it come so far that through these delicious conversation they happen to get a sweetheart and in good time a bedfellow to keep them from slumbring and sleep and it be very pleasing to see that they do so observe the make good of the old proverb a old bird do the young one sing which be a very pleasant thing happy be you o you new housholders who have already possess your self of so many pleasure in your marriage and be now come just to the very entrance to repossess your self of them over again and perchance theyl never depart from you as long a you see the one day follow the other be not backward or negligent in relate your happiness to other but if there be any distast or disaster that can happen in the married estate lock it up in the very closet of your heart and abhor everlastingly the thought of relate it then you will have many that will pursue your footstep and be list into your company then also will your estate and condition be famous through the whole world conclusion thus long you have see courteous reader how that those married people who be but indifferently gift with temporal mean indeavour to puff up each other with vain and airy hope and imagination perswading themselves that all the trouble vexation and bondage of the married estate be nothing els but mirth delight and pleasure perhaps to no other end but to mitigate their own miserable condition or els to draw other into the same unhappy snare a indeed oftentimes hapneth but it be most sad and lamentable that the meaner sort of people when they have throw themselves into it make their condition a thousand time bad then it be before for they who at first could but very soberly and sparingly help themselves do find when they be marry that they must go through not only ten but at least a thousand care and vexation and all what hath hitherto be say of the ten pleasure be only speak of the good and most agreeable match and not of any of those which many time be so different and contrary of humour a the light be from darkness where there be a continual hell of dissent curse mumbling and maundring nay bite scratch into the bargain which for the most part be occasion by the quarrelsom crab lavish proud opinionated domineering and unbridled nature of the female sex besides there be a great number which i will be silent of who do all they can to please other and cuckold their own husband and other there be that disguise themselves so excessively with strong water that a whole day long they can hardly close their floudgates so that you need not wonder much if you see the great part of woman tho they trick themselves never so finely up can hardly get husband and their parent be fain at last to give a good sum of mony with them that they may disburthen themselves of them insomuch that it be easie to be see that they be in effect of less value then old iron boot and shoe c for we find both merchant and mony ready alwaies to buy those commodity therefore o you that be yet so happy a to have keep your self out of this dreadful estate of marriage have a horror for it shun a woman much more than a fish doth the hook remember that solomon amongst all woman kind could not find one good observe by what hath befall those that go before you what be approach to your self if you follow their footstep and be most certainly assure that the acute pen be not able to expound the light feasiblest trouble and disaster of marriage set then aside the most difficile and ponderous do but read with a special observation the insuing letter of a friend advice touch marriage imprint it a with a seal upon your heart and lay fast hold upon that golden expression of the glorious apostle it be good for man not to touch a woman the end of the ten pleasure of marriage aletter from one friend to another desire to know whether it be advisable to marry sir i must acknowledge that the letter which you have writ me hath give me some incumbrance and make me more then three time to ruminate upon the question you propound to me concern marriage for it be a matter of great importance that ought to be well ponder and consider of before one should adventure to solemnize celebrate it several of my familiar friend have trouble me touch the very same subject and i give them every one my advice accord a they be affect but methinks i ought not to deal so loose and unboundedly with you by reason i dare speak unto you with more freedom and truth first there be two thing which bind me strictly to you nature and the affection and moreover the great knowledge i have of this so necessary an evil i will tell you my opinion then you may use your own discretion whether you will approve of my meaning for advice or not for my part i beleeve that of all the disaster we be subject to in our life time that of marriage take preference from all the rest but for as much a it be necessary for the multiply the world it be fit it should be use by such a be not sensible of it and can hardly judge of the consequence thereof neither do i esteem any man unhappy let whatsoever disaster there will happen to him if he doth not fall beyond hi sence so far a to take a wife those trouble that may befall u otherwise be alwaies of so small a strength that he who hath but the least magnanimity may easily overpower them but the torture of marriage be such a burthen that i never saw no man let him be as couragious a he would which it hath not bring under the yoke of her tyranny marry then you shall have a thousand vexation a thousand torment a thousand dissatisfaction a thousand plague and in a word a thousand sort of repentings which will accompany you to your grave you may take or chuse what sort of a wife you will shel make you every day repent your taking of her what care will come then to awake and disturb you in the middle of your rest and the fear of some mischance or other will fee your very spirit with a continual trouble for a morningalarm you shall have the child to awaken you out of sleep their

confess that he who can pass away hi day without a wife be the most happy verily a wife be a heavy burthen but especially a married one for a maid that be marriageable will do all that ever she can to hide her infirmity till she be tie in wedlock to either one or other miserable wretch she overpower her very nature and affection change her behaviour cover all her evil and wicked intention she dissembleth her hypocrisie and hide her cunning subtlety she put away all her bad action and mask all her deed she mollify both her speech and face and to say all in one word she put on the face of an angel till she hath found one or other whom she think fit to deceive with her base trick and action but have catch him under the slavery of this false apparition she then turn the tother side of the meddal and draw back the curtain of her vizards to shew the naked truth which she so long have palliate and her modesty only forbid her to reveal by degree then vomit up the venom that she so long have harbour under her sweet hypocrisie and then be repent or the great understanding of no worth to you perhaps you may tell me that you have a mistriss who be fair rich young wise airy and hath the very majestical countenance of a queen upon her forehead and that these be all reason which oblige you to love her but i pray consider with your self that a fair woman be oftentimes tempt a young peril a rich proud and haughty a wise hypocritical an airy full of folly and if she be eloquent she be subject to speak evilly if she be jocund and light heart shel leave you to go to her companion and think that the care of her mind be with you in your solitariness and by reason she can flatter you so well it never grieve you if she be openhearted her freedom of spirit will appear hypocritical to you her airiness you will judge to be trick that will be very troublesom to you if she love play shel ruin you if she be liquorish and sweettoothd she lead your child the ready road to an hospital if she be a bad housekeeper she let all thing run to destruction that hath cost you so much care and trouble to get together if she be a finical one that will go rich in her apparel shel fill the shopkeeper counter with your mony and in this manner her lavishness shall destroy all your estate to be short let her be a she will she shall never bring you much profit in good troth i esteem very little those sort of thing which you imagine to have a great delight in ti true if you take a wife which be ugly poor innocent without either air or spirit thats a continual burthen to you all your life time the old be commonly despise the ugly abhord the poor slight and the innocent laught at they be call beast that have no ingenuity and woman without airiness have generally but small sence of love in these last some body might say to you that one ought to take of them that be indifferently or reasonably well qualified but i will surge a little high and tell you plainly that that will be just like one who fear to drown himself at the brink of a river goeth into the middle to be the high above water you see now why i can not advise you to marry yet i would not have you to beleeve tho i so much discommend it that it be no way usefully profitable i esteem it to be a holy institution ordain by god almighty that which make it bad be the woman in whom there be no good if you will marry

scale of marriage may hang somwhat evener and not fall too light on the woman side we shall for the courteous reader add unto them ten pleasures more be that which some married people have since confess or to be short with you be formerly winkd at and pass over plate publish by the navarre society london the first pleasure the young couple begin to keep shop and demand their promised portion till now o new married couple you have pass through the first part of your wedlock with feasting and pleasure and have injoied no smal delight in it but what be there in this world that we grow not weary of you have see that the sumptuosest feast full of delicate dish and the pleasurable country scituations with al their rich fruit finally cloggeth through the continual injoyment of them nevertheless it be the general desire of all person forasmuch a it be possible to live in the world in pleasure and delight amongst the rest the gain of mony be none of the small pleasure and this appear to be the least burthensom tho it have much trouble in it therefore be it very much commendable o young couple though you have a pretty estate of your own accord a your contract of marriage testifies and a we have also see by the wedding you keep your apparel and the other ap and dependance that you begin to meditate how to make the best benefit of your stock and so much the more because your predecessor get it with a slavish diligence reap it together with sobriety keep it with care and finally leave it unto you for your great pleasure it be then also not strange if you a true breed child keep it carefully and make the best profit of it to the end that your successor when time shall serve may find that they have have frugal parent and so walk in your footstep verily this be one of the necessariest meditation in the world if we could but any way make the dead sensible of it in their grave undoubtedly the reliques of your parent would rejoice at so happy and careful an intention of you their child and truly what be there among other cogitation more pleasurable then to begin with a handsom shopkeeping for this through the daily gain yeelds every day new pleasure and by consequence a merry life ti true merchandize bear a great respect and yeelds also sometimes great gain but with these trouble somtimes it be for the most part subject to great and weighty loss which be the destruction of young people and so intangles the merry part of their life that fear and care deprive them of their night rest if the wind blow hard they be presently in a fear that the ship at sea laden with their good and ware may be shipwrackd if they will assure them then the assur go away with the profit and they be also so greedy and cunning that the least storm or bad tiding make them very slow and circumspect or if they be not so it be to be fear so there happen many loss that then the assur himself might come to be lose but the handsom shopkeeping be the surest and pleasurablest for every moment you get new customer as well from abroad a at home who buy continually with ready mony or otherwise pay the old score and trust the new yea all the news that go about the city be bring home and impart to you theres not a man die or woman bring to bed but you have knowledge of it well then what great pleasure can there be then this also young woman you may through

them up in the same way and so get a due faithful and careful assistance from them which will not so well be do by men and maidservant and over whom there be seldom so much command a over one own child and if your husband continue in health and find that trading grows quick he perceive that by the assistance of hi wife something els may be take by the hand that be also profitable and then he will alwaies exercise some sort of merchandise that be secure and advantagious it be most certain sweet woman you will be the more tied to your housekeeping and can not so often go to visit and take your pleasure with your gossip a you formerly do in coach or by water a if your husband have take any sort of merchandice in hand because that a woman who be marry to a shopkeeper be a it be also wed to the counter by reason you dare not trust your shop to old much less to new men or maidservant because they do not perfectly understand the trade and thereby also find occasion to make one bed serve for both and junket together which make no small confusion in the family but little regard must be take about that for the important must alwaies be take care of and be assure if the desire of gain small trading and bad paiment begin once to take possession of you the thought of all the former pleasure will remove and you will exchange them for those that be more noble and become viz in the well governing of your men and maidservant in the shop and house and take inspection that they be obedient unto you the family must be wel take care of go to market with the maid to buy that which be good

then you have ascensionday which may as well be use for pleasure a devotion and if that be too short presently follow whitsontide then you may sing tantarroraara three day together and get your fill of it so that you may find time enough to take your delight and pleasure tho you be a little tie to a shop this be then in such manner take into a ripe deliberation by some of the near relation it be conclude on to set up a handsom shop and to furnish it with al sort of necessary and by that mean make that you may alwaies say yea and never no to the customer o how glad the good woman be now she see that her husband who be otherwise somewhat stifnecked let himself be perswaded to this by hi friend and how joyful be the husband that hi wife who at first seem to be highspirited be now herewith so absolutely contented o happy match where the delight and pleasure of both party be bent upon one subject how fast doth this writhe and twist the band of wedlock and love together certainly to be of one mind may very well be say to be happily marry and call a heaven upon earth here they be cite to appear who display the married estate too monstrously a if there be nothing but horror and terror to be find in it now they would see how that love in her curious crusible melteth two heart and ten sences together to this all chymists vail their bonnet though they brag of their make the hard mineral as soft a milk and butter this art surpasseth all other yet here ought to be consider what sort of trading shall be pitcht upon the man hath good knowledge in cloath silk stufs french manufacture and galantries c but the woman think it would be much good if they handle by the gross in italian confit candied and musk sugar plum raisons of the sun fig almond pistaches bon christian pear granadapples and dry fruit together with greek and spanish wine delicate sack muskadine and frontinyack wine which be a negotiation please to the ey delicious for the tast and beloved by all the world and by this she think she shall procure a many customer a her husband because she hath familiar acquaintance with several brave gentlewoman that throw away much mony upon such commodity and make many invitation treat and feasting and she her self could alwaies be presently ready when she receive an honourable visit o happy man who hath gotten such an ingenious understanding wife that take care and considers with her self for the do all fit and necessary thing to the best advantage and really she be not one jot out of the way for this sort of merchandize be both relish and delightful and must be every foot buy again now the time require go to market to buy fir oak and sackerdijne wood and to order that the shop may be neatly build and set up and you be happy that master paywell who be a very neat joiner and cabinetmaker be of your very good acquaintance and so near by the hand he know how to fit and join the pannels most curiously together and so inlaies shave and polish the fine wood that you would swear it be all of one piece well here again be another new pleasure and delight if all thing go thus forward certainly the weddingcloaths will in a short time be at the least a span too little o how glad youl be when this trouble be but once over and that the shop be neatly build paint gilt furnish and finely put into a posture o how nobly it appear and how delightful and please it will be when this new negotiant see hi shop full of customer and he at one counter commend praise and selling and one servant bring commodity to him and another hath hi hand full with measure and weigh and hi beloved at another counter find imploiment enough with tell mony weighing of gold and discourse with the customer then it wil not seem strange unto you how it come to pass that your predecessor get such fine sum of mony together and leave them unto you to be merry with therefore you ought also even a they do to provide your self with a curious and easie to be remembred sign because your customer by mistake might not come to run into your neighbor shop i have not yet forget that your grandfather be a wollen draper first hang out the sign of the sheep and hi name be james thomson but by reason of hi great custom they call him by the nick name of james in the sheep which remain still a a name to the generation and in like manner your wife grandfather a well custom shopkeeper in silkstufs whose name be william jackson hang out the sign of the silkworm but hi son go to school with another boy whose name be also william jackson for the make a distinction between them they give him the name of william the silkworm which also remain a a name to the family this be not common only among the londoner but in other city and country town also among coachman wagoner and other but come we wil take our leaf of these people and turn again to our new married couple who can hardly rest quietly a night for the earnest desire they have to see all thing accomplish and their trading go forward and in time tom thumb get on hi doublet tho he be seven year pull on the first sleeve yet before you come to this great pleasure youl meet with a troublesom obstruction in the way which if you can but turn of bravely it will be much the pleasanter for before the shop be fully furnisht you will see what there will be want to fill all the corner and place with commodity that must be sell by length of time and to stand out the trust and also with patience and meekness expect the come of mony from slow and bad paymaster therefore it begin to be time to speak of the promised portion uds bud what a racket be here now for the young man father have make hi full account that he should not already be dund for the promised portion not doubt but that the young woman lay all totally ready told of in bag and think to take it in the best sence i will pay my son hi interest yearly and afterwards in peaceable time when theres little or no imposition and that my coffer be good furnisht will then give him the principal and seriously the old man seem to deal herein very cordially since other men father do not do half so well and only give this for an answer with young men must be promise and with daughter must be give and other make their son give them a bond wherein he a by example acknowledgeth to be indebted to hi father six hundred pound whereupon the father close the match and promiseth to give in marriage with hi son six hundred pound which at last come to nothing at all and only serve for a perfect cheat to deceive and hoodwink the eys of the pretended gentlewoman and her guardian it be no wonder where such match be make if when such thing be discover there be a great deal of time spend before they can come to the true pleasure but you o new married man who have a liberal father on your side you can get provisionally your interest and when time mend your principal perhaps it will not be half so well with your wife estate for she it may be in her maiden estate hath spent and run out more in gaudy apparel to intice a lover then the interest of her estate could bear insomuch that the principal be diminish or the revenue thereof receive and consume long before they be due s wound in what a sweat and fear with these sort of cogitation be this approach new shopkeeper in how earnestly he run to her guardian to see if they will unriddle him this doubt that he be in but to hi good fortune he find it in a much good condition than he think he should for hi dear hath spend much less in her apparel and maintenance then she could have do so that theres not only mony in stock but rent of her real estate that be yet to be pay unto her though there be very much consumed for her bride apparel and the other accoutrement well this be an extraordinary pleasure and a great comfort for hi pant heart uds life how many hundred kiss be now offer at the altar of her sweet lip that otherwise would not so much a have be think upon therefore one may easily perceive that mony increaseth love very much and that lover in these time be so bent upon mony and so diligent in search of it be no admiration nay they scruple not to inquire of the guardian and up and down by unsworn broker who negotiate with a very close intelligence in this sort of fleshtrade and draw ten double salary and that ofttimes too from both side if they can but help anyone to a good bargain and that he obtain access and afterwards wheedle it about so that it finally come to be a match but what sad issue generally such sort of match be attend with be well know to the whole world you o lover who seek to be livry men of the great company and aim to possess the pleasure of marriage have a care of the inchanting voice of these crafty syrens because they intend to batter you upon the scylla and charibdis where the hellish fury seem to keep their habitation these be the only occasion of bad match and such a raise a scandal of that estate which at once affoards both pleasure mirth and joy but our new married couple go clear another way to work who now to their full contentment act so many pretty apish trick injoy such multiplicity of kindness and toss each other such quantity of kiss a if there be a whole kingdom or at the least a vast estate to be gain thereby so that they find that in that estate there be not only ten but a thousand pleasure cement together in it whereof in the following shall be demonstrate in some part the imperfect gloss but never the accomplished portrait plate publish by the navarre society london the second pleasure the husband grow pipsy and keep the first lyingin take the doctor advice be mock by hi potcompanions just a one candle light another so we see also that two sympathetically mind know by the cleaving of their lip together how to breathe into each other their burning heartsdesire wherewith the one doth a it be kindle the other and do every moment renew and blow on again their even just now extinguished delight of this you have here a pattern from our late marry for whom the long summer day and winter night fall too short to satisfy their affection they hardly know how to find out time that they may bestow some few hour in take care for the ordring and set all thing in a decent posture in their new make shop imagine that they shall alwaies live thus salamanderlike in the fire without be ever indamaged by it but time will teach them this well in the mean while we will make our self merry with the pleasure of this married couple who see now their shop fully in order furnisht with several brave good and a pretty young fellow to attend it but because customer do not yet throng upon them they find no other pastime then to entertain each other in all manner of kind imbracements and to chear up their heart therein to the utmost here it may be plainly see how pleasant and delightful it be for the young woman because her physiognomy begin to grow the long the more frank and jocund so that to u her countenance doth display her soul content ere since her wedding day but just a a burn candle doth consume though to it self insensible yet maketh of hers joyful by it light so doth our new marry man before few month be expire find that he become the very subject of flout at and laughter among hi former boon companion because every one jestingly tell him that he be sick of a fever that the paleness of hi face the lank of hi cheek and thinness of hi calf doth shew it most plainly and verily there be some artificial jester who do it so neatly that he himself beleeves it almost to be true yet nevertheless to avoid their mockery cast it of from him as far a possible may be but hi own opinion doth so clearly convince him that in himself he ponder and considers what course be best to be take but housoever as long a he go and walk up and down eats and drink he think that the tide will turn again yet find himself inwardly weak of body rally with hi own distemper in hope that by hi jesting among hi merry companion he may from them understand what be best upon such occasion to be do or avoid and they seriously jest say to him o friend wean yourself from your wife and tobacco and drink chocolate and eat knuckle of veal or els youl become like one of pharaoh lean kine oh ho think he if that be true i have spend my reckon this even very happily now young woman dont you admire if your husband come home at night discontent in mind for hi wit run a woolgathering and he have walkt in a dump from towerhill to tuttle field contrive whats best for him to do and how to compass the matter neatly for to remain so from hi dear and delicate wife not pay unto her the usual family duty be below the generosity of a man and to tell her what the matter be be yet bad to leave of tobacco and eat knuckle of veal be feasible but to go to a coffehouse and alwaies drink chocolate that stick against the stomack nevertheless necessity hath no law and the occasion overpowers affection insomuch that after a thousand pondrous consideration he resolve to deny hi dearly beloved wife a little of that same and to that purpose will somtimes in an evening feign to have the headake or that he be very dull and sleepy which be no absolutely and thereby command hi man to call him up somtimes very early in the morning a if there be forsooth customer in the shop c and hunt up and down among the chocolate dealer to get of the very best prepare it himself in milk treat all that come to visit him with chocolate instead of tobacco and he feign that he hath an extraordinary delight in it and on the other side perswade hi wife that he have a huge mind to eat a knuckle of veal some good broath and newlaid egs or some such sort of pretty conceited diet but perceive that this avail little and that he grow rather weak then strong away he trot to the scotch paduan doctor who immediately prescribe a small apothecary shop at the least twenty or more several sort of herb to be infuse in a pottle of old rhenish wine and twice a day to drink half a quartern thereof at a time item a plaister to be apply to hi stomack and an unguent for the pit of the stomack under the nose and to chafe the temple of the head but most especially to keep a good strengthning diet c but this seem to have too much stir in the view of hi wife therefore must be lay aside and away he go then to a high german doctor who without stop or stand accord to the nature of hi country mountebanklike begin to vaunt a followeth ach herr ihr zijt ein hupscher aber ein swaccher venusritter ihr habt in de garten der beuchreiche

absence of hi wife reveals it unto him o how delicately these card be shufled if the game go thus forward it will come to be a stately pleasure but principally for the doctor who privately simper at the playing of hi own part and never fail to note down hi visit but most especially if he have the delivery of the medicins into the bargain place them then so largely to account as be any way possible to be allow of which make the apothecary burst out into such a laughter a if he have receive the tiding of a new bankrupt but go you forward doctor it must be so you have not study for nothing and it be no small matter to be every time order of new remedy especially when we see that you constantly write rx vini rhenani vetustissimi generostssimi m ij and then again to eat oftentimes pistaches almond custard and tansy c though since the patient like make a martyr of himself be in this manner fall into the hand of the doctor hi dearly beloved wife be not negligent to acquaint all the friend with it who immediately come run to give a visit to the sick and speak word of consolation to the good woman but alas grief and sorrow hath take such deep root in her heart that no crums of comfort though ever so powerful can dispossess her calamity for the seeing of a husband who love her so unmeasurably and be so friendly and feminine to ly sick a bed would stir up the obdurest heart

rally they begin to get the bibbingbottle and guess at the same time a if it have be tell them that the doctor in hi last receipt have order rhenish wine and just a the woman in the eighth pleasure of the first part produce abundance of remedy the assembly of men do here in like manner cast up a hundred receits which make peggy the maid blush and be most cruelly ashamed at but behind the window she listen most sharply to hear whats tell and confess by those that be in the chamber a to the further matter of fact for master barebreech relate that a he be travel the last summer into the north and so forward into scotland go through edenburgh meet there with hi cousin master coldenough who lookd so lean and palefacd that master barebreech tell him in truth cousin i should hardly have know you

come in with a fresh kan and master winetast begin to relate how that he use to be familiarly acquaint with a certain brave judge who have a bucksom bounce lady to hi wife the judge feign a letter which at noon a he be sit at table with hi lady be bring him very cleaverly by hi man he seemingly unknowing of it open and read that he must immediately without further delay go upon a journy have read that prepare himself with hi man forthwith to be go but whilest the judge be go into hi closet a seem to take some important writing along with him the lady call hi man privately into the parler and force him by threat of her displeasure to tell her who deliver him that letter with a promise of her favour if he speak the truth whereupon the fellow trembling answer madam i have receive it from my lord the judge but he hath strictly command me to keep it secret so that if he come to know that i have mention any thing of it to your ladiship he will have the great displeasure of the world against me do not you fear anything say her ladiship but be faithful in what you do a pretty while after the judge have be some time at home and walk with hi lady towards their garden they meet with a drove of sheep have but one ram amongst them whereupon her ladiship askt sweetheart how come it that that one sheep hath such horn and the tothers none at all my dear say he that be the ram the hesheep what say she be the other then all shes o yes my love answer he how reply she but one ram among so many sheep yes hony say the judge that be alwaies so then sighingly she say alas poor creature how must you long then to walk some other road there have be more related for master carouser be entred upon a new subject but because the doctor come in they be constrain to break of but ellen the starchster be busie in the kitchin with the mistriss about order the linnen have let the doctor in saith mistriss the doctor be come there and be go into the chamber by my truly mistriss i hear say that my master hath get a fever o nel saith the mistriss this be clear another thing this sickness be not without great danger and it would be no such wonder if my husband hapned to dy of it and where should we then find the pleasure of marriage that some arch jester so commonly talk of but kind mistriss be not so hasty it be impossible to express all the pleasure so fully in one breath you must note that they be all a it be for the present hid behind the curtain neither must you expect to sail alwaies before wind and tide and beleeve me there be yet other nut to be krackt the third pleasure whilest the husband be from home the wife play the divel for god sake the husband upon hi journy will want for nothing it seem to be a divellish blur in the escucheon and a cruel striving against the stream that as soon a the shop be just make and furnisht then the good man fall sick and keep the first lying in plate published by the navarre society london but experience have teach him that with relishing and solid dish a man may overclog himself he think it not unadvisable to take a journy now and then from home to see if he can get some new customer in other town or buy in some good and ware for hi shop by which mean he may as well take a good care for hi health a he doth of hi shopkeeping yet what come here in the way the pleasure be so great and their love so tender and newly stamp to each other again that the young woman think she shall do a formerly cyana do either consume her self in tear or drownd her self in a river if she must suffer this oh the whole world will be unto her a dead and without any thing of mankind if her dearly beloved depart from her well who will not then but beleeve that the married estate be full of incomprehensible and inexhaustible pleasure and sweetness do but behold how these two honybirds sing loath to depart yea pray observe what a number of imbracings how many thousand kiss and other toyisch action be use before this couple can leave one another nevertheless the reason of necessity doth forsooth conquer in a vigilant husband these effeminate passion therefore away he go leave hi whine beloved sit between her sister and her neece speaking word of consolation to her and use all argument possible to enliven and make her sorrowful heart merry either of them strive to be most free in proffer to be her bedfellow and the next day to keep her company but ala say she suppose ye do all this yet nevertheless i have not my husband with me but because time and good company help to decline and pass away sorrow she very happily begin to consider that she hath now a fit opportunity to invite her neeces and bridemaids and other good acquaintance with whom she hath be formerly mighty familiar to come and take a treat with her and to drink a dish of tee for they have when she be in her maiden estate treat her so many time with tart pankakes and fritter custard and stewd pruins that she be as yet ashamed for not have make them some recompence and she never could find an occasion that be convenient before because one while she dwell with her guardian and at another time with her uncle who take very sharp notice where on and in what time her pocketmony be spend and consume that they continually give her for trivial expences which vext her so much the more because the treat she receive be for the most part do to bring her acquaint with this or that gentlewoman brother or cousin or some other pretty gentleman to the end that by this mean she might happen to make a gallant match and indeed the first original of the wooing and acquaintance with her beloved have there it foundation to treat these gentlewoman when her husband be at home would no way appear so well and so much the more because they generally suffer themselves to be conduct to the place by one or other of their gallant who then either very easily be persuade or it may be of themselves tarry to take part with them therefore this must be do and conclude on because she hath now the disposal and keep of the mony as well a her husband here now must doll run up and down tantwivy to borrow a rowlingpin and some other new invent knickknack to bake cheesekakes and custard in whilest mage be also hardly able to stand long upon her leg with run up and down to fetch newlaid egs flour sugar spice blanchd almond c the mistriss and doll be able to perform this duty well enough for they both helpt to do it very neatly at her neeces birthday but the pastrycook must be speak to for the make a delicate mincd py and mage must run to the confitmakers in blackfryers to fetch some conserve preserve and of all other sort of sweetmeat raisin of the sun and more of the like ingredient c for she know best where all those thing be to be have and for a principal dish there ought to be a pot of venison a couple of neatstongues a delicate peece of martelmas beef some anchovis and olive for the gentleman because they certainly will accompany the gentlewoman and truly they that bring them may very well tarry to carry them home again it be also but one and the same trouble goodman twoshoes be go out of town and see it not neither need he know it when he come home he treat so many of hi friend and acquaintance and then again next day follow invite them to a fishdinner i may very well play my part once in my life and have all thing to my mind let come ont what will who know whether such another occasion may happen again this three year and against next morning very privately she invite the gentlewoman alone to come about nine a clock in the morning to eat hot bun and cake for then they come precisely out of the oven and in the afternoon again to some curious fruit pankakes and fritter and a glass of the pure canary let it cost ner so much or be fetcht ner so far thus run the tongue of this pretty housewife that but a while ago be so sorrowful for the departure of her beloved husband certainly theres nothing come out more suddenly or dry up more easily then womens tear but hangt no more of that for the guest will be here presently therefore all thing ought to be in order for mirth and moreover there there be some of them that frequent mr baxters puritanical holdingforth whose head will immediately in imitation of their patron hang like bullrush for they be taught to mourn with the sorrowful and to rejoice with the joifull but it be now a time to be merry and throw away mask and vizards for all be do under the rose and among good acquaintance and verily if the good woman have not this or some such sort of delight where should we find the pleasure of marriage for in the first lyingin of the husband there be no look for them come on then that mirth may be use let the card also be bring in sight which formerly out of a puritanical humour ought not to have be see in a house nay not so much a to have be speak of but now every one know how to play artificially at put all four omber pa la bete bankerout and all other game that the expert gamest can play at and who know whether they do not carry in their pocket a falsegamesters do card that be cut and mark they learn to play the game at bankerout so well with the card that in a short time they can and also do it with their housholdstuf ware and commodity to be sure youl alwaies find that every one of them by length of time be capable of set up a school and to act the part of a mistriss and most especially they learn to discourse very exactly touch the use and misuse thereof just a these dissimulate wig intend to do though indeed men have never see that they practise this lesson themselves but although the mistriss and her companion know little or nothing of these trick they serve howsoever without set up a school and that also for nothing for good instructress to their servant who hereby be most curiously teach what path they have to walk in and whats best for them to do that they may follow their mistress footstep as soon a their master and mistriss be but go abroad together who then know so exactly how to dance upon those note that we think it necessary a be one of the principallest pleasure of marriage also to be set down in the third table of the first part many woman who be sick of this liquorish and sweettoothd disease will be grumble very much at this that such a blame and scandal should be cast upon their innocent sex and say that batchelors hereby will be afraid to marry but if they and the gentlewoman that be in private domineering together have not go to confession and make a publick relation of it who would have know it therefore this sort of well treat female guest be like unto those that when they have get a delicate bit by the by can not fare well but they must cry roastmeat though they should be beat with the spit for it but the good one though they be thin sown who be not distemper with this evil never trouble themselves at what one will say or another write concerning woman because their guiltless conscience serve them as well a a thousand witness and they be very indifferent whether that the deceased scandal raiser hippolitus do arise and come into the world again dare him in this manner surge then hippolytus out from thy ghostly nest who scandal least esteem revenge themselves the best yet howsoever though this be true nevertheless i must furnish the delicate stomackt lady with some sort of weapon that they may be in a posture of defend themselves against their vituperous enemy for verily there be several men that walk not so even and neat in their way a they ought to do and who know whether our mistress dearly beloved at this very present doth not a many other have do who when they be travel any whither the first thing they do be to be very diligent and look earnestly about whether there be not some handsom gentlewoman that travel with them by whom they very courteously take place shew themselves mightily humble and complacent and tell them that they be batchelors or at the least widower then cast out a discourse of play a game at card that they may the good see what mettle the lady be make of and then again when they come to a baitingplace or where they must stay the night over there they domineer lustily with them and play the part of a rodomontade where many time more be act and spend then they dare either tell their wife or their father confessor of other there be who seek not so much such company but very artificially before hand know how to find out such fellowtravellers a most suit with their own humour to that end provide themselves with some bottle of canary and pure spanish tobacco and where ever they come be sure to make choice of the best inn where theres a good table delicate wine and a handsom wench to be have certainly if the husband thus one way and hi wife another know how to find out the pleasure of marriage they be then both of them happy to the utmost be it not possible but that they might if this continue long take a journy for pleasure to brokershall for at first it be by them esteemd too mean a place to be lookd upon and not worth their thinking of but then it probable it may come into their consideration by reason that rent be low there provision very cheap and pleasure in abundance neither hath pride or ambition take any habitation there nay who know but that they might chance to observe that there be no such need of feast and junket nor be subject to so many visit because there dwell not such a number of their friend and acquaintance and besides all this you may there for a small matter agree with the collector of the excise so that for a whole year you may have wine and several other thing plenty for little or nothing but let lay aside all this because they be untimely cogitation that fly astray and it be much decenter that we turn again to our kindhearted mistriss with her merry companion who now be about the take leave of each other use to shew their gratitude whole bundle full of complement offer them up with an inexpressible amiablenes and eloquency for the respect and honour they have receive and confirm them with so many kiss cursies bow and conge that it be easie to be perceive that on both side it cordially mean and doll that good and faithful servant be not able to express how pleasing this entertainment hath be to all the company nay it lie buzz her so in the pate that she can not be at quiet in a morning whilest her mistriss be asleep but she must with the neighbor maid either at the opening of the shop or sweeping of the street be tatling and tell of it to them put every foot into their hand privately some almond and raisins that come in by leger de main relating unto them a if she do it by a scrole what a horrible quantity of thing she hath to scour and wash that must be make clean and set in order against the time that the bridemaids a it be mention be to come again alone and so much the more because her master be daily expect home who then finally come in be not ordinarily welcome for she be so full of joy that her husband be come home that both her tongue and action be incapable of demonstrate her felicity and he on the tother side be so glad to find hi dearly beloved in good health and all thing in decent order that it be beyond imagination all this while they both laugh in their sleeve that each one in thabsence of the tother hath take to themselves such a private an cunning pleasure finding so much content and injoiment therein that they both hope to serve themselves again with the like occasion o mighty pleasure of marriage who would not but be invite to go into this estate especially if we proceed to write down and rehearse the further confession of the separate pleasure of man and wife which be preserve a matter for the insuing fifth and sixth pleasure plate publish by the navarre society london the fourth pleasure the wife will be master of the cash or mony chest a mony be one of the most curious mineral be it in like manner the less admirable that the handling and use there of rendreth the great pleasure of the world it be loves fire and charity fountain yea if man and wife in their house keep may be esteem or compare to the sun and moon in the firmament verily those merry white or yellow boy may very well be consider of a twinkle star it rejoiceth all mankind to behold in the sky the innumerable multitude of glitter star but it be a far surpassing pleasure that the new married couple receive when they see vast heap of silver and gold ly dazling their eys and they lord over it you o lately marry couple posse this pleasure to the utmost you have to your content receive your promised portion you one want the great iron monychest to lock it up in securely and to keep it safely that it may be lay out to advantage o how pleasant the free dispensation thereof be unto you what a noble valley it be to walk in between these mountain and to delight your eys with such an object yet nevertheless o faithful couple here be need that a great deal of prudence be use as well in the laying of it out a the preserving of it in ancient time it hath be often observe and take notice of that where mony be hide the place be generally hanted with terrible spirit and strange ghost that walk there come in frightful apparition but since they have be drive out of our country and house theres another sort of imp come in ten time wickeder then any of the other which regard nor care neither for cross holywater exorcism or any sort of diveldrivers but dare boldly shew himself at noonday namely a plaguedivel which set man an wife together by the ear to try who of them both shall have the command and government of the cash or monybox and to the end he may herein act hi part well he know how very subtlily first to fill the weak woman ears full that she ought above all thing to have the command of the cash because she have such a great portion and that it be her mony which she hear gingle so and then again because the care of the housekeeping be appropriate to be her duty it be against all reason that she like a servant should give an account to her husband what wherefore or how that the mony be lay out because the necessary also for housekeep be so many that they be without end name or number and it be impossible that one should relate or ring them all into the ear of a man likewise the good woman can not have so fit an occasion every foot to be make some new thing that she may follow the fashion a it be usual for woman to do much less to have any private pocketmony to treat and play the divel for god sake with her bridemaids when her husband be go from home and on the contrary when men pay out any thing it go out by great sum accord a be specify by the account deliver which must be set to book and an acquittance give this can not be so do with every pittifull small thing that belong to housekeep insomuch that the husband can then with all facility demand what mony be needful for hi occasion from hi wife moreover when the wife hath the command of the mony she can alwaies see in what condition and state her affair stand and by take good observation thereof her husband can not fob her off with pumpkin for musmillions but shel easily perceive whether she be decrease or increase in her estate so that if her husband might come to dy and she be leave a widow with several child she can immediately see and understand in what posture her affair stand and whether she be get forward or go backward in the world and whats more yet it would be a great shame for a woman who hath alwaies be so highly respect by her husband and a it appear to all the world be honour like a princess that she should within dores be as servile a a servant and must be feed out of her husband hand just a if she be a wastall a sweettooth or gamestress c with these and a thousand such like argument doth this plaguedivel know how to puff up the vain humour of the weak woman to the true pitch of highmindedness and on the contrary be in the mean while busie with flattery to stir up the husband to idle imagination and selfconceitedness demonstrate unto him that he be the lord and guide of hi wife create to command her and she to obey him that it be most easie to be perceive what a noble creature man be whilest that woman who be so handsom and haughty be nevertheless but add unto him a a servant therefore if he once admit hi wife into an equality with him he will then be subject to see that she will be strive for the predominancy and that it be the great curse imaginable in a country for woman to lordize over men and for these reason they ought to be but like the nul in figure and to be keep a a controuler by the harth the pot and the spinningwheel whilest they that deliver up to them the key of the monychest be deprive of all their superiority and like men unmand have only the name but can not obtain the effect in such manner doth a yet this divelplaguing spirit domineer by clear daylight in many of the principallest house and heart and make oftentimes so great a difference and discord about the key of the cash that the cash it self seem to get eagle wing and swiftly fly away whilest the husband perceiving that the wife seek to deceive and take the key from him be alwaies possess with abhominable suspicion certainly think that she be mind to make some unnecessary thing or other or to hide some mony from him which make him watch her water so much the stricter and be not ashamed to give out and make what he hath a mind to for hi own pleasure and the wife perceiving that her husband be so sneaking and forsooth so circumspect with subtilety contrives and practise how to make him pay out mony for all what she hath any way a mind to by that mean make her self mistriss of the monychest beyond hi knowledge though he hath the name and carry the key in hi pocket for if she have a mind to new stay for her self or daughter away she go to a silkshop buy stuf to her mind and causeth it to be make as modish a possible may be and have try that it fit and please her fancy fully then it be bring home by one or other of her trusty acquaintance who come at a convenient time appoint just like some petty brokester proffer it forsooth in sale to the mistriss and till her a relation that it be really make for such a lady but that she die whilest it be make and for that reason it may be have for a very low price yea that it be such a cheap bargain that perhaps the like may not be have again this ten year c thus the good wife know rarely well how to play her part and begin to reckon how many ell of stuff how much for line and the making thereof would come to cost so that her husband by reason of the cheapness be curious of himself to desire her to try it on and finally see that it fit her a if it have be make for her to be short after much cheapning and bargain the price be conclude on though it be against the husband stomack or the cash wel can bear it and then the broker be order when she hath such or the like other good bargain to come again and let them see it in this manner the wife fetch about by the by as much a she can and hoodwink her husband een a she please for at other time there come to be sell tablecloaths napkin and then again coat sheet blanket and all sort of necessary for housekeeping and habit from some gentlewoman or other that it left to by the decease of some friend c insomuch that the wife through the niggardliness of her husband imbezles away and buy more then otherwise she would do make it all her delight and sole pleasure to blind fold her narrowsould peep in the pot a she call him although she by these way and mean doth jestingly consume her own self but this belong also to the pleasure of marriage and if it in the conclusion prove to be a pain patience be the best remedy but be merry o new married couple that you like unto young toby have find out the remedy how to drive away this devilplaguer of your wedlock by live in love and tranquility equally confide in each other desire no superiority but with a true cordiality interchangeably grant and have each alike freedom of the monies the husband hath the keep and government of the key and the wife want for no mony nay hath access also her self to it who can doubt but that your family will be blest and your stock of monies increase and that so much the more because the husband hat play at table and the wife be an enemy to card which hath be the occasion ofttimes on both side of the consume much mony and therefore be little use by some shopkeeper leave that to gentleman to lose both time and mony who therein seek their pastime delight and pleasure and this be in like manner imitate by many great lady who be often so cruelly addict to cardplaying that they somtimes value not in one even the losing of very great sum and yet know how to maintain their respect therein very prudently and gallantly but in the mean while let the millaner linnendraper tailor and shoemaker run most miserably and shamefully after them for money from one month to another ofttimes from one year to another a if they come beg to them for a peece of bread and when they do pay them it must not be take notice of by their lord and husband these generally use the great violence against the peace of the family because this superfluous expence and liberal disposition of my lady be very seldom please to my lord who little think that her ladiship would have be such a spendthrift of the cash but since great lord as well a other meaner sort of person be shot and piercd by one and the same blind cupid they be in like manner subject to such casual of adversity and pleasure and every one perceive when it be too late what kind of election he hath make just a they do who begin a war but before it half finish be weary of it therefore to battel be ye slow but slow be to wed for many do repent untill that they be dead but if avoid then by you it can not be a thousand counsellor will well deserve your fee plate publish by the navarre society london the fifth pleasure of men negligence of their affair whereby their antictricks and loss of time be discover verily the woman be the weak vessel be many time most cruelly impeacht when the marriageship sail not well before wind and tide just a if they to whom be only give the charge of the family care of the kitchin and nourishment of the child be the occasion of sad casual and disaster in the merchandizes and shopkeepings when on the contrary the negligence of the men be many time so great that if the woman know not how to carry her self like a prudent abigail it would be impossible ever to bring the ship to a safe harbour and to free it from shipwrack but all thing must run to a total destruction many men be free hereof who be continually use their utmost indeavours and take their chief delight in the promotion of their affair by day with their body and at night with their sences be earnestly busie in contrive them it whose main aim be to live honestly to get a good name to shew good example to their child and servant to leave somthing to their widow and never to be a laughingstock or derision to their enemy and this manner of diligence make no labour irksom no morning too early nor no evening too late for them but other on the contrary be so easie humour and so negligent of their vocation that they think it much below the respect of a man to be see whole day in their house with their wife and about their affair then in such case there must by every one in hi call be find a multitude of lame excuse before they can blind the eys of a quicksighted woman or pin it upon her so far that she perceive not he seek hi pleasure from her in whom hi whole delight ought to be if it be doctor of physick he forsooth hath no time to study because he must go to visit a patient that hath a violent ague to see what operation the cordial hath do which he order him to take yesternight for if any thing els should come to it he would certainly be a dead man c and if you do but trace hi path and patient it be by hi friend who yesternight be trouble with a vehement cellarfever and at the very last before he go to sleep take in a swinging bowl of strong liquor which make hi pulse beat so feaverish and disorderly the next morning that he be necessitate at one draught to whip off a lusty glass of wormwoodwine an excellent remedy for the ague and then to walk an hour or two upon it wherein the doctor accompany him it cause the good operation here now you see the doctor and what ague the patient hath what he take fort what come to it and how dead a man he be truly the doctor hath make a neat a guess at it a if he have study long for it hang the book when a man hath hi art so perfect in hi pate for this the doctor hath so much good again when he hath a mind to visit a patient in tuttlestreet or st james square this patient walk along with him for company and when one hand wash the other in this manner o then they be both so silver clean turn you about now to the counsellor and see how their study be all on fire only to be go too and again from one court to another to hear forsooth this or tother cause plead that mightily concern them thereby to take their measure accordingly when to the contrary it serve to no other purpose then to sell a parcel of chatwood and tatle tale of some brave practitioner a great deal bad then woman would do and finally to appoint a place where in the evening they may accompany their fraternity at a good glas of wine under this bundle resort continually the shittlecock exciseman accompany with collector and promooters who be the great bellringers in tavern and somtimes in one even spend as much in rhenish wine oisters and tobacco a ten sufficient family would do in a month these live without care and command freely out of a full purse imagining in themselves that all the revenue be their own and if their wife do in the least but peep into their concern they presently baptize it with the name of go upon an exploit to chase a fat doe or neatly to attrap some defrauder and that this part may have the good gloss when they come home in the morning they have their pocket full of mony which they throw into their wife lap and tell them that they have attrapped some body and agree with them for a great sum of mony have in part of paiment receive this when to the contrary it be all the king and country mony only take out of their office this generally last so long till they be pursue by the treasurer and be arrest and clapt up or that they prevent it by play bankrupt and in this manner leave a sorrowful widow and child behind them by these the foolwise notary for the most part join themselves make their wife beleeve that they be send for into this or tother alehouseor tavern about an exciseman business or to write a will or a contract of agreement of merchandize though it be to no other end or purpose then to have a perfect knowledge who play best at ticktack irish backgammon passage or allfours from thence then they can not come before it be late in the night and have learn there to make a scotch will so wel that they be by two witness half carry and half traild home to their house brag still that they have have wine and beer and receive mony into the bargain thus all thing be baptize with the name of have earnest business the like knowledge have also the merchant shopkeeper and other who love company to alledge for their excuse and defence but the most fashionable give it the name of go to a sale of some land and house part of ship merchandizes shopwares meeting or arbitration though many time in more then a month there hath not be the least sale of any of the aforenamed commodity or occasion for any such sort of business and verily whom do you see sooner or later at the exchange then these sort of people and ti no wonder for since they indeavour not to have the name of brave negotiant their principallest aim be to obtain the name of great newsmonger and that hath so much tittletattle in it that it require a person free from all affair and business to be imploied therein here you may perceive them to be the most diligent of all other oftner inquire what tidings there be in the french english and flanders letter then to know what news from the sea concern the arrival or loss of ship or what merchandizes commodity and ware be rise or fall in price nevertheless these make the great bawling and scold at their wife if they have not their dinner make ready for them precisely an hour before changetime just a if the main weight of all the traffick and negotiation at change lay upon their shoulder though it only tend to follow the train and to hear some news or to seek some potcompanions these blade will be sure also in the winter time by four and in the summer time by six a clock in the evening to be precisely at the coffehouses where under the taking of a pipe of pure spanish tobacco some dish of coffe chocolate sherbate or limonado there be a relation make of the new tidings or what be most remarkable of thing that have hapned here or there they hear there no clock strike nor think upon wife child or servant though it be never so late there another sort of men that do not frequent the exchange and go out only about their shop affair these we see take their pleasure for several hour together at queenhithe and other place with selling of chatwood and when they be a weary with walking and talk away they go to the plume of feather to rest themselves and call for half a pint or a pint of sack and some to the strong water shop and drink a quartern of cinamon water clovewater or aqua mirabilis and these imagine themselves to be of the most orderly sort by reason that some men in the summer time take their pleasure most part of the morning to be busie at their wormwood wine and consume their afternoon in clash and quafing off the bottels of old hock and spawwater and when it grow cold and the day short then they be early at the strongwater shop and in the evening late in the coffehouses and again twice or thrice a week precisely and that more devouter then once in a church they be most certain to be find at the playhouse whilest other again be earnestly imploied in take their pleasure in a coach or on horseback amble trotting and gallop along the high way from one country fair or horsemarket to another and at every place where they see but a conveniency to stable their horse there they be certain to bait and consume an infinite deal of time especially if they happen to find any horsecoursers there to be chat and chaffer with these be much like unto those that take delight in pleasureboats and barge who with the small gale of wind be storm out of all their occupation nay although they be never so important yet the very breathing of a warm zephyr blow not only all business out of their head but themselves in person out of their shop and countinghouse here you may behold them with unwearied body rig of their mast spread of their sail hail up their spreet and leeboards and all in a sweat catch hold of the oar to be row whilest at home they be too weak or lazy to move or stir the least thing in the world nay can hardly bring pen to paper for to neglect such a gallant and pleasant day of weather would be a crime unpardonable no lover of a boat may stay within a port though shop and office both should dearly suffer fort other again be swear pigeon merchant and every market day in the forenoon precisely let it cost what it will must be attend there and the rest of the week both morning and afternoon at their pigeontraps here in they take an infinite pleasure hush up their pigeon to flight then observe the course they take look upon the turning of their tumbler and then to the very utmost commend the action carriage and colour of their great runt small runt carrier light horseman barberies cropper broadtaild shaker and jacopins take care and make so much provision for their young one that they let both their own young and the housekeeping run to destruction but there be the cockmerchants surpass these abundantly who upon certain penalty must at the least thrice a week appear in the cockpit and there before the battel begin consume two or three hour at table and in wine beer and tobacco whilest they attend there the come of their adversary and other lover of the sport here then a view must be take of each other cock which be forsooth accord to their merit and value set apart in their coop either in the yard or above in the garret to be feed a be most convenient and theres then a discourse hold concern them a if they be person of some extraordinary state quality and great valour not a word must be speak as much a if there be a penalty impose upon it but of cockfighting here master capon vaunt that hi gamecock be hard enough for the gallant shakebag of sir john boaster although sir john boaster famous shakebag but three week before have fight against that incomparable gamecock of squire owlseg and clawd him off severely here you may see abundance of country gentleman and rich farmer come from several part with their cock in their bag to the battel hang them up there in ample form till it be their turn to fight and there also you may behold lord spendall bring thither in hi coach very magnificently and carry home in no le state but seldom go away before he hath either win or lose a pretty number of guinneys yea theres squire clearpurse with hi princely companion who keep alwaies six and thirty gamecock at nurse by the master of the pit never go away from thence before he hath get by hi ordinary dunghill cock that run about the street and without false spur too half a score crownpieces and as much more a will pay hi reckon in hi pocket but if they both begin to appear with their shakebags then it be stand clear gentleman here come the honour of the pit and then the master of the pit must have out of each battel for sharpning the spur and clipping of the neck feather half a ginny and then when the battels end he bring into the reckon half a crown extra for brandy salve and cherishing and chafe it by the fire c but for this they have the honour also to be in the chamber with the principallest gentleman to sit in the best place of the pit to turn the hourglass and like prudent alderman in the presence of all the auditor to give their judgement touch the contending party where there be generally more consultation advice and sentence hold and pronounce then be to be find or hear of in the principallest lawbooks or statute of the kingdom it would be here an everlasting shame if the conqueror like a niggard should carry all this mony home therefore the great part must be give and generously spend with the company this be the duty of every one whose cock hath beaten anothers out of the pit and go away crow like a conqueror nay whats matter if it be all spend it no such great peece of business the honour more worth then the mony in the mean while it grow late in the night and the good woman with the table cover sits long tell every minute and hop for the come home of him who seem to find and take more pleasure in cockfighling then like a brave gamecock himself to enter into the pit with hi wife o most contrary and miserable pleasure of marriage on the men side but amongst these cockmerchants i be of opinion there none hath more pleasure then the master of the pit because he get more for the feeding clip salving and anointing of them c then ten good nurse and put them all together and moreover he hath all the pleasure for nothing and be mighty observant to fee and tickle their fancy and obey their command that their delight therein may the more and more increase and the reckoning also be ner a whit the less and these lover and gentleman be no sooner depart but he lay him down very orderly in a very fashionable bedstead hung round about the curtain and vallians with hensegshels suckd out but if he do for the same purpose suck out all the cocksegshels it would be a much more rare and pleasant sight there be yet another sort of men which we in like manner find that consume their time neglect their occasion and spend their mony with dogfighting bull and bearbaiting a the cockmerchants do with cockfighting one way that they take pleasure in be to bring their dog together and there fight them for a wager of five or ten pound and somtimes more which mony must be set or stakd down though they hardly know how to find a much more again in the whole world and there the poor dog by bite and tear one anothers skin and flesh in piece for the pleasure of their fantastical master and if the wager be in the least manner to be contradict then toot they go themselves and thump and knock one another till they look more like beast then men this be do the next meeting be to try their bear and bulldog at the bear garden the match be make all their wit must be screwd up to the high how to get mony to make good their wager though wife house and family should sink in the mean while then away they go with their tousers and rouser to the beargarden and then the bull be first bring to the stake the challenger let fly at her and the bull perceive the dog come slant him under the belly with her horn and toss him as high a the gallery this be much laught at but hi master very earnestly and tenderly catch him in the fall try him the second time when he come off with little good success then hi adversary let loose hi dog at the bull who run close with hi belly to the ground fasten under the bull nose by the skin of the underlip the bull shaking and roaring to get him loose but he hold faster and faster then up flie cap and hat shout out the excessive joy that there be for this most noble victory now come the bear dog be stout swing mastives and the bearard have bring the bear to the stake unrings him and turn him about so that he may see the dog thats to play at him the challenger let fly hi dog which be a cruel strong cur rise up to the bear nose fastens and turn him topsyturvy theres no small joy and an eccho of shout that make the very earth tremble then theres pull and hawling to get him off from the bear then the adversary let fly hi dog who come to fasten the bear be furious and angry that he be so plagud with the first dog clap hi paw about the back of him and squeeze him that he howl and run there stand the master look like an owl in an ivybush to see the stake drawn and he haply with never a penny in hi pocket hath no mony at home nor know not where to get any and that which vexeth him bad of all be that hi delicate dog be utterly spoild but wel leave of these inhuman and brutal story and rather relate the confession of another sort of men who be generally of a long temper not much unlike to the bigbellied weak woman nay sometimes do therein far surpas the woman and altho they know that it be never so damagable or hurtful unto them yet dare boldly say when woman long it harm by chance but mens desire a worser dance and in this they be both bold and shameless clear contrary to womenkind in so much that they without fear or terror dare at noon day say to their potcompanions i have a mighty mind to a pipe of tabacco come let go to the sun half moon or to the golden fleece and smoke a pipe where they rip up such a multiplicity of discourse and consume so much time and tabacco that if they taste neither beer nor wine they might with all reason be upbraid to be debauchd person but it would be a work as inexpressible a infinite to relate their longing appetite at all other time to musmillions seldry anchovis olive or slubbring caviart with all their appurtenance much more their liquorishness at oisters where they stand greedily swallow them up in the open shop not give themselves time to send for them to a tavern and eat them decently if they do thus in the presence of their wife they might have some pleasure of it also but the content hereof seem to consist therein that either alone or with their fraternity they may thus lustily satisfie their longing appetite here we shall commend the lover of tee because they be willing to make use of it in the company of woman although there be now a day so much formality use with it and so much time idly spend in the consumption of it that it seem almost a if this herb be find out or bring over to no other purpose then to be the occasion of an honest chattingschool between men and woman where you may have intelligence of all that pass betwixt marry and unmarried person throughout the whole city and wo be to them that have the least symptom of a meazle upon their tongue for the true lover of tee be like unto the supper up of coffy and be the best newsmonger for all thing that happen in the city yea almost in all kingdom and when you hear the men speak seriously of such matter it be a if they have the best correspondence for intelligence out of all prince court but especially if this miracle be work thereby that the water be change in to wine other who love neither tee nor coffy and yet be very desirous to know what pass in the world you may find mighty earnestly for some hour stand prate in the bookseller shop alwaies ask what news be there what pamphlets what pasquils what play what libel or any of the like rubbish be lately come out and then they must buy and read them let it cost what it will here they make the sole balance of statebusiness here with great prudence discourse be hold of the important stateaffairs and of the supreamest person in authority and in their own imagination know more then both the house of lord and common although they never sate in councel with any of their footman nay they know to the weight of an ace and can give a perfect demonstration of it which of the three government be best monarchy anarchy or democracy which many time take such a deep root and impression upon them and touch them so to the very heart that they absolutely forget the governing of their needful affair which they go out about for when they come to the place where their occasion lay they find the person either long before go abroad or so imploied with hi own business that he can hardly a quarter do that he ought to do ti true some soft natured woman that be as innocent a dove observe not these sort of action and trick but suffer themselves easily to be fopt off by their husband or els by a gentle salutation be appease but other who be cunninger in the care of their shop and family can no way take a view of these doings with eys of pleasure yet this be nothing near the bad sort and be naught els but a kind of a scabbiness that the most accomplishedst marriage be infect with and verily if the husband do thus neglect their time and their wife in the meanwhile like careful bee be diligent in look after their shop and housekeep they ought when they do come home to speak their mind somthing freely to them but the imaginary authority of men many time surge to such height that it seem to them insupportable to hear any thing of a woman contradiction think that all what ever they do be absolutely perfect and uncontrolable and can on the contrary when their wife go to the shamble or market reckon to a minute in what time they ought to be back again and wo be to them if they do accord to the nature of woman stand and prattle here or there their time away concern lace cookery and other houshold occasion but you o wel married couple how pleasant it be to see that you two agree so well together that either be alike diligent and earnest in take care of their charge that your husband many time saith unto you hi houswife my dear it be a curious fair day go walk abroad and give a visit to some or other of your good acquaintance i shall tarry at home the whole day and will take sufficient care of all thing and in the evening come and fetch you home c and you again in like manner upon a good occasion releeve your husband and take delight in hi walk abroad with some good friend to take hi pleasure and to recreate and refresh hi tired sences if he be a little sickish of that distemper and that he will somtimes spend a penny upon a libel or new tiding that be a great pleasure for you because you know that the bookseller and printer must live and every fool must have one or tother bawble to play with you have great reason to be dissatisfy if he consume hi mony in the tavern or with table but you know that ben johnson poem and pembrooks arcadia do so inchant you that they forct the mony out of your pocket yet they servd you in your maiden estate with very good instruction and shew you many vertu you may therefore think that such men who desire to surge high in knowledge will have somthing also to be read and it be most certain whilest they be busie with that their wife be free from be control ti also undeniable that men can not alwaies be alike earnest in their affair for verily if they be so they be for the most part great peep in the pot and direct of their wife who have certainly their imperfection and it be the principallest satisfaction and great pleasure in marriage when a woman wink or pass by the action of her husband and the husband in like manner the action of hi wife for if that be not so how should they now and then in pass by throw a lovekiss at one another or how should they at night be so earnest in press one another to go first to bed ti therefore above all thing very needful for the increasing of love that a woman wink at many of her husband action especially if he keep no correspondence with tiplers that will be alwaies in the alehouseand there too will be servd and wait upon forsooth to a hair breadth nay and a we perceive if the wife brings in the anchovis upon the table without watring them a little a oftimes happen there then the house be full of hell and damnation for these small sort of gentleman be they who sow strife and sedition between man and wife and continually talk of new tavern and alehouseclean pot and the best wine they alwaies know where there be an oxhead newly broachd and the first word they speak as soon a they come together be well sir where be you yesternight that we saw you not at our ordinary meeting place ho say the tother twas at the blew boar where i drink the delicate wine that ever my lip taste you never taste the like ont if i should live a thousand year the tast would never be out of my thought nay if the god do yet drink nectar it be certainly prest out of those grape word can not possibly decipher or express the tast though tully himself the father of eloquence have drunk of it would make the oration what do you think then if you and i go thither immediately and drink one pint of it stand i be sure sir that you will as well a i admire it above all other do it be and away they go but it be not long before you see those rose blossom in their hand of whose smell tast and colour a neat draught be take and an excellent exposition of the quality yet the tother gentleman commend it to the high though he be assure that he taste a glass in master empty vessel cellar that be far delicate and that he would far esteem beyond this nevertheless he acknowledge this to be very good but the pint be out the first word be hangt what go upon one leg draw tother pint of the same wine and then they begin to find that the longer they drink the good it tasts which be an undeniable sign that it be pure good wine and this pint be out again presently say the tother all good thing consist in three so that we must have the tother pint where upon the second saith a soon a this be out we will go with the relish of it in our mouth to master clean pint to tast hi and this against each other i be content so say so do and thus by the oftentimes taste and retasting they grow so mighty loving that it be impossible for them to depart from one another because they every foot say they can not part with an empty pot and this love in a few hour grows on so hot that the love of the wife be totally squencht not only draw men mightily out of their business but keep them late out from their family and make them like incarnate divels against their wife from whence proceeds that when they come either whole or half drunk home there be nothing well to their mind but they will find one thing or another to controul bawl or chide with to these also may be adjoin those who generally resort to the miter king arm and plume of feather or some other place where they commonly make their bargain for buy and selling of good and merchandizes from whence they seldom come before they have spend a large reckoning and lose more then three of their five sences think themselves no less rich then they be wise and ly then very subtlely upon the catch to overreach another in a good and advantagious bargain by which mean they themselves be somtimes catcht by the nose with a mouldly old sort of unknown commodity that they may walk home with by weep cross and next morning there they stand and look a if they have suckt their dam through a hurdle and know not which way to turn themselves with their merchandize they have make in this manner bring their wife and child if they let them know it into excessive inconvenience and for all this want for nothing of grumbling and mumble some sort of men be tyrant when their thirsty soul be filld they scold sore hot like peep in th pot and never can be stilld they talk and prate at such a rate and think of nought but evil they fight and brawl and wife do mawl though all run for the divel but at their draugh they quaff and laugh amongst their fellow creature they swear and tear and never fear old nick in hi bad feature who would but say then by the way that woman be distress who must indure anepicure with whom shell ner be bless in this last many father commit great error who when they be hotheaded with multiplicity of wine take little regard of the bad example they shew unto their child and family nay some there be that will in their sobrest sence go with their son a if they be their companion into a tavern without make any sort of difference and also when there be a necessity or occasion for it know but very slenderly how to demonstrate their paternal prudence and respect but in this manner let loose the bridle of government over their child thus i know an understanding father do who with some other gentleman and hi son be upon a journy together to take care of some important affair but see that at every inn where they come that hi fellowtravellers be resolute blade and that he must pay a deep to hi son a himself exhort hi son to take hi full share of all thing and especially of the wine every foot whisper him in the ear peter drink and then after a little while again peter drink and a he recommend this so earnestly to hi son he himself very diligently lose no time to get hi share which continue so long that go out of the chamber for their necessity they both fell into a channel where clasp each other in the arm the son say father be we not now like brother by this we may observe what the father of a family by hi example may do but you o wellmatchd woman have no need to fear this sort of president in your husband because he be a perfect hater of excessive drinking and an enemy to such company that alwaies frequent tavern and alehouse
