an essay concerning the true original extent and end of civil government it have be shew in the foregoing discourse that adam have not either by natural right of fatherhood or by positive donation from god any such authority over hi child or dominion over the world a be pretend that if he have hi heir yet have no right to it that if hi heir have there be no law of nature nor positive law of god that determines which be the right heir in all case that may arise the right of succession and consequently of bearing rule could not have be certainly determine that if even that have be determine yet the knowledge of which be the eldest line of adam posterity be so long since utterly lose that in the race of mankind and family of the world there remain not to one above another the least pretence to be the eldest house and to have the right of inheritance all these premise have a think be clearly make out it be impossible that the ruler now on earth should make any benefit or derive any the least shadow of authority from that which be hold to be the fountain of all power adam private dominion and paternal jurisdiction so that he that will not give just occasion to think that all government in the world be the product only of force and violence and that men live together by no other rule but that of beast where the strong carry it and so lay foundation for perpetual disorder and mischief tumult sedition and rebellion thing that the follower of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against must of necessity find out another rise of government another original of political power and another way of design and know the person that have it than what sir robert filmer hath teach u to this purposethink it may not be amiss to set down what take to be political power that the power ofmagistrate over subject may be distinguish from that offather over hi childrenmaster over hi servanthusband over hi wife andlord over hi slave all which distinct power happen sometimes together in the same man if he be consider under these different relation it may help u to distinguish these power one from wealthfather of family and captain of galley political power thentake to beright of make law with penalty of death and consequently all less penalty for the regulating and preserving of property and of employ the force of the community in the execution of such law and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreign injury and all this only for the public good of the state of nature to understand political power right and derive it from it original we must consider what state all men be naturally in and that isstate of perfect freedom to order their action and dispose of their possession and person a they think fit within the bound of the law of nature without ask leave or depend upon the will of any other man a state also of equality wherein all the power and jurisdiction be reciprocal no one have more than another there be nothing more evident than that creature of the same specie and rank promiscuously bear to all the same advantage of nature and the use of the same faculty should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection unless the lord and master of them all should by any manifest declaration of hi will set one above another and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty this equality of men by nature the judicious hooker look upon a so evident in itself and beyond all question that he make it the foundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men on which he build the duty they owe one another and from whence he derive the great maxim of justice and charity hi word be the like natural inducement hath bring men to know that it be no less their duty to love other than themselves for see those thing which be equal must need all have one measure if can not but wish to receive good even a much at every man hand a any man can wish unto hi own soul how should look to have any part of my desire herein satisfy unless myself be careful to satisfy the like desire which be undoubtedly in other men be of one and the same nature to have any thing offer them repugnant to this desire must need in all respect grieve them as much a me so that if do harmmust look to suffer there be no reason that other should shew great measure of love to me than they have by me shew unto them my desire therefore to be love of my equal in nature as much a possible may be imposeth upon menatural duty of bear to themward fully the like affection from which relation of equality between ourselves and them that be a ourselves what several rule and canon natural reason hath drawn for direction of life no man be ignorant eccl pol lib but though this be state of liberty yet it be not state of licence though man in that state have an uncontroulable liberty to dispose of hi person or possession yet he have not liberty to destroy himself or so much a any creature in hi possession but where some nobler use than it bare preservation call for it the state of nature have law of nature to govern it which oblige every one and reason which be that law teach all mankind who will but consult it that be all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in hi life health liberty or possession for men be all the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker all the servant of one sovereign master send into the world by hi order and about hi business they be hi property whose workmanship they be make to last during hi not one anothers pleasure and be furnish with like faculty share all in one community of nature there can not be suppose any such subordination among u that may authorize u to destroy one another a if we be make for one anothers use a the inferior rank of creature be for ours every one a he be bind to preserve himself and not to quit hi station wilfully so by the like reason when hi own preservation come not in competition ought he as much a he can to preserve the rest of mankind and may not unless it be to do justice on an offender take away or impair the life or what tend to the preservation of the life the liberty health limb or good of another and that all men may be restrain from invade other right and from do hurt to one another and the law of nature be observe which willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind the execution of the law of nature be in that state put into every man hand whereby every one have right to punish the transgressor of that law to such degree a may hinder it violation for the law of nature would a all other law that concern men in this world be in vain if there be no body that in the state of nature have power to execute that law and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offender and if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he have do every one may do so for in that state of perfect equality where naturally there be no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another what any may do in prosecution of that law every one must need have right to do and thus in the state of nature one man come by power over another but yet no absolute or arbitrary power to use criminal when he have get him in hi hand accord to the passionate heat or boundless extravagancy of hi own will but only to retribute to him so far a calm reason and conscience dictate what be proportionate to hi transgression which be so much a may serve for reparation and restraint for these two be the only reason why one man may lawfully do harm to another which be that we call punishment in transgress the law of nature the offender declare himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity which be that measure god have set to the action of men for their mutual security and so he become dangerous to mankind the tye which be to secure them from injury and violence be slight and break by him which be trespass against the whole specie and the peace and safety of it provide for by the law of nature every man upon this score by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may restrain or where it be necessary destroy thing noxious to them and so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgress that law a may make him repent the do of it and thereby deter him and by hi example other from do the like mischief and in the case and upon this ground every man hathright to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature i doubt not but this will seem very strange doctrine to some men but before they condemn itdesire them to resolve me by what right any prince or state can put to death or punish an alien for any crime he commit in their country it be certain their law by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promulgate will of the legislative reach not stranger they speak not to him nor if they do be he bound to hearken to them the legislative authority by which they be in force over the subject of that commonwealth hath no power over him those who have the supreme power of make law in england france or holland be to an indian but like the rest of the world men without authority and therefore if by the law of nature every man hath notpower to punish offence against it a he soberly judge the case to requiresee not how the magistrate of any community can punish an alien of another country since in reference to him they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another besides the crime which consist in violate the law and vary from the right rule of reason whereby man so far becomes degenerate and declare himself to quit the principle of human nature and to be noxious creature there be commonly injury do to some person or other and some other man receive damage by hi transgression in which case he who hath receive any damage have besides the right of punishment common to him with other menparticular right to seek reparation from him that have do it and any other person who find it just may also join with him that be injure and assist him in recover from the offender so much a may make satisfaction for the harm he have suffer from these two distinct right the one of punish the crime for restraint and prevent the like offence which right of punish be in every body the other of take reparation which belong only to the injured party come it to pass that the magistrate who by be magistrate hath the common right of punish put into hi hand can often where the public good demand not the execution of the law remit the punishment of criminal offence by hi own authority but yet can not remit the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he have receive that he who have suffer the damage have right to demand in hi own name and he alone can remit the damnified person have this power of appropriate to himself the good or service of the offender by right of selfpreservation a every man have power to punish the crime to prevent it be commit again by the right he have of preserve all mankind and do all reasonable thing he can in order to that end and thus it be that every man in the state of nature have power to killmurderer both to deter other from do the like injury which no reparation can compensate by the example of the punishment that attend it from every body and also to secure men from the attempt of criminal who have renounce reason the common rule and measure god hath give to mankind hath by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath commit upon one declare war against all mankind and therefore may be destroy a lion or tyger one of those wild savage beast with whom men can have no society nor security and upon this be ground that great law of nature whoso sheddeth man blood by man shall hi blood be shed and cain be so fully convinced that every one have right to destroy such criminal that after the murder of hi brother he cry out every one that findeth me shall slay me so plain be it writ in the heart of all mankind by the same reason may man in the state of nature punish the less breach of that law it will perhaps be demand with deathanswer each transgression may be punish to that degree and with so much severity a will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender give him cause to repent and terrify other from do the like every offence that can be commit in the state of nature may in the state of nature be also punish equally and a far forth a it may incommon wealth for though it would be besides my present purpose to enter here into the particular of the law of nature or it measure of punishment yet it be certain there be such law and that too a intelligible and plain torational creature and studier of that law a the positive law of commonwealth nay possibly plainer as much a reason be easy to be understood than the fancy and intricate contrivance of men follow contrary and hidden interest put into word for so truly aregreat part of the municipal law of country which be only so far right a they be found on the law of nature by which they be to be regulate and interpret to this strange doctrine viz that in the state of nature every one have the executive power of the law of naturedoubt not but it will be object that it be unreasonable for men to be judge in their own case that selflove will make men partial to themselves and their friend and on the other side that ill nature passion and revenge will carry them too far in punish other and hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow and that therefore god hath certainly appoint government to restrain the partiality and violence of meneasily grant that civil government be the proper remedy for the inconveniencies of the state of nature which must certainly be great where men may be judge in their own case since it be easy to be imagine that he who be so unjust a to do hi brother an injury will scarce be so just a to condemn himself for it but shall desire those who make this objection to remember that absolute monarch be but men and if government be to be the remedy of those evil which necessarily follow from men be judge in their own case and the state of nature be therefore not to be endureddesire to know what kind of government that be and how much good it be than the state of nature where one man command multitude have the liberty to be judge in hi own case and may do to all hi subject whatever he please without the least liberty to any one to question or controul those who execute hi pleasure and in whatsoever he doth whether lead by reason mistake or passion must be submit to much good it be in the state of nature wherein men be not bind to submit to the unjust will of another and if he that judge judge amiss in hi own or any other case he be answerable for it to the rest of mankind it be often ask a mighty objection where be or ever be there any men in such state of nature to which it may suffice a an answer at present that since all prince and ruler of independent government all through the world be instate of nature it be plain the world never be nor ever will be without number of men in that statehave name all governor of independent community whether they be or be not in league with other for it be not every compact that put an end to the state of nature between men but only this one of agree together mutually to enter into one community and make one body politic other promise and compact men may make one with another and yet still be in the state of nature the promise and bargain for truck c between the two men in the desert island mention by garcilasso de la vega in hi history of peru or betweenswiss and an indian in the wood of america be bind to them though they be perfectly instate of nature in reference to one another for truth and keep of faith belongs to men a men and not a member of society to those that say there be never any men in the state of naturewill not only oppose the authority of the judicious hooker eccl pol lib i sectwhere he say the law which have be hitherto mention ie the law of nature do bind men absolutely even a they be men although they have never any settled fellowship never any solemn agreement amongst themselves what to do or not to do but forasmuch a we be not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent store of thing needful for such life a our nature doth desirelife fit for the dignity of man therefore to supply those defect and imperfection which be in u a living single and solely by ourselves we be naturally induce to seek communion and fellowship with other this be the cause of men unite themselves at first in politic society but moreover affirm that all men be naturally in that state and remain so till by their own consent they make themselves member of some politic society anddoubt not in the sequel of this discourse to make it very clear of the state of war the state of war be state of enmity and destruction and therefore declare by word or action not passionate and hasty but sedate settle design upon another man life put him instate of war with him against whom he have declare such an intention and so have expose hi life to the other power to be take away by him or any one that join with him in hi defence and espouse hi quarrel it be reasonable and justshould have right to destroy that which threaten me with destruction for by the fundamental law of nature man be to be preserve as much a possible when all can not be preserve the safety of the innocent be to be prefer and one may destroyman who make war upon him or have discover an enmity to hi be for the same reason that he may killwolf orlion because such men be not under the tie of the commonlaw of reason have no other rule but that of force and violence and so may be treat a beast of prey those dangerous and noxious creature that will be sure to destroy him whenever he fall into their power and hence it be that he who attempt to get another man into hi absolute power do thereby put himself into state of war with him it be to be understood a declaration of design upon hi life for have reason to conclude that he who would get me into hi power without my consent would use me a he please when he have get me there and destroy me too when he have fancy to it for no body can desire to have me in hi absolute power unless it be to compel me by force to that which be against the right of my freedom ie make me slave to be free from such force be the only security of my preservation and reason bid me look on him a an enemy to my preservation who would take away that freedom which be the fence to it so that he who make an attempt to enslave me thereby put himself intostate of war with me he that in the state of nature would take away the freedom that belong to any one in that state must necessarily be suppose to havedesign to take away every thing els that freedom be the foundation of all the rest a he that in the state of society would take away the freedom belonging to those of that society or commonwealth must be suppose to design to take away from them every thing els and so be look on a instate of war this make it lawful for man to kill thief who have not in the least hurt him nor declare any design upon hi life any farther than by the use of force so to get him in hi power a to take away hi money or what he please from him because use force where he have no right to get me into hi power let hi pretence be what it willhave no reason to suppose that he who would take away my liberty would not when he have me in hi power take away every thing els and therefore it be lawful for me to treat him a one who have put himself into state of war with me ie kill him if can for to that hazard do he justly expose himself whoever introducesstate of war and be aggressor in it and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war which however some men have confound be a far distant a state of peace good will mutual assistance and preservation and state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction be one from another men live together accord to reason without common superior on earth with authority to judge between them be properly the state of nature but force or declare design of force upon the person of another where there be no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief be the state of war and it be the want of such an appeal givesman the right of war even against an aggressor tho he be in society andfellow subject thusthief whomcannot harm but by appeal to the law for have steal all thatam worthmay kill when he set on me to rob me but of my horse or coat because the law which be make for my preservation where it can not interpose to secure my life from present force which if lose be capable of no reparation permit me my own defence and the right of warliberty to kill the aggressor because the aggressor allow not time to appeal to our common judge nor the decision of the law for remedy incase where the mischief may be irreparable want ofcommon judge with authority put all men instate of nature force without right uponmans person makesstate of war both where there be and be notcommon judge but when the actual force be over the state of war cease between those that be in society and be equally on both side subject to the fair determination of the law because then there lie open the remedy of appeal for the past injury and to prevent future harm but where no such appeal be a in the state of nature for want of positive law and judge with authority to appeal to the state of war once begin continue with right to the innocent party to destroy the other whenever he can until the aggressor offer peace and desire reconciliation on such term a may repair any wrong he have already do and secure the innocent for the future nay where an appeal to the law and constitute judge lie open but the remedy be deny bymanifest perverting of justice andbarefaced wresting of the law to protect or indemnify the violence or injury of some men or party of men there it be hard to imagine any thing butstate of war for wherever violence be use and injury do though by hand appoint to administer justice it be still violence and injury however colour with the name pretences or form of law the end whereof be to protect and redress the innocent by an unbiassed application of it to all who be under it wherever that be not bona fide do war be make upon the sufferer who have no appeal on earth to right them they be leave to the only remedy in such case an appeal to heaven to avoid this state of war wherein there be no appeal but to heaven and wherein every the least difference be apt to end where there be no authority to decide between the contender be one great reason of men put themselves into society and quit the state of nature for where there be an authoritypower on earth from which relief can be have by appeal there the continuance of the state of war be exclude and the controversy be decide by that power have there be any such court any superior jurisdiction on earth to determine the right between jephtha and the ammonite they have never come tostate of war but we see he be force to appeal to heaven the lord the judge say he be judge this day between the child of israel and the child of ammon judg xiand then prosecute and rely on hi appeal he lead out hi army to battle and therefore in such controversy where the question be put who shall be judge it can not be mean who shall decide the controversy every one know what jephtha here tell u that the lord the judge shall judge where there be no judge on earth the appeal lie to god in heaven that question then can not mean who shall judge whether another hath put himself instate of war with me and whethermay a jephtha do appeal to heaven in it of thatmyself can only be judge in my own conscience aswill answer it at the great day to the supreme judge of all men ofslavery the natural liberty of man be to be free from any superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man but to have only the law of nature for hi rule the liberty of man in society be to be under no other legislative power but that establish by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of any law but what that legislative shall enact accord to the trust put in it freedom then be not what sir robert filmer tell u observation aa liberty for every one to do what he list to live a he please and not to be tie by any law but freedom of men under government be to havestanding rule to live by common to every one of that society and make by the legislative power erect in itliberty to follow my own will in all thing where the rule prescribes not and not to be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown arbitrary will of another man a freedom of nature be to be under no other restraint but the law of nature this freedom from absolute arbitrary power be so necessary to and closely joined withmans preservation that he can not part with it but by what forfeit hi preservation and life together forman not have the power of hi own life can not by compact or hi own consent enslave himself to any one nor put himself under the absolute arbitrary power of another to take away hi life when he please no body can give more power than he have himself and he that can not take away hi own life can not give another power over it indeed have by hi fault forfeit hi own life by some act that deserve death he to whom he have forfeit it may when he have him in hi power delay to take it and make use of him to hi own service and he do him no injury by it for whenever he find the hardship of hi slavery outweigh the value of hi life it be in hi power by resist the will of hi master to draw on himself the death he desire this be the perfect condition of slavery which be nothing els but the state of war continue betweenlawful conqueror andcaptive for if once compact enter between them and make an agreement forlimited power on the one side and obedience on the other the state of war and slavery cease as long a the compact endures for as have be say no man can by agreement pas over to another that which he hath not in himselfpower over hi own life i confess we find among the jew as well a other nation that men do sell themselves but it be plain this be only to drudgery not to slavery for it be evident the person sell be not under an absolute arbitrary despotical power for the master could not have power to kill him at any time whom atcertain time he be oblige to let go free out of hi service and the master of suchservant be so far from have an arbitrary power over hi life that he could not at pleasure so much a maim him but the loss of an eye or tooth set him free exod xxi ofproperty whether we consider natural reason which tell u that men be once bear have right to their preservation and consequently to meat and drink and such other thing a nature affords for their subsistence or revelation which give u an account of those grant god make of the world to adam and to noah and hi son it be very clear that god a king david say psal cxvhas give the earth to the child of men give it to mankind in common but this be suppose it seem to some very great difficulty how any one should ever come to haveproperty in any thingwill not content myself to answer that if it be difficult to make out property uponsupposition that god give the world to adam and hi posterity in common it be impossible that any man but one universal monarch should have any property upon supposition that god give the world to adam and hi heir in succession exclusive of all the rest of hi posterity but shall endeavour to shew how men might come to have property in several part of that which god give to mankind in common and that without any express compact of all the commoner god who hath give the world to men in common hath also give them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life and convenience the earth and all that be therein be give to men for the support and comfort of their be and tho all the fruit it naturally produce and beasts it feed belong to mankind in common a they be produce by the spontaneous hand of nature and no body have originally private dominion exclusive of the rest of mankind in any of them a they be thus in their natural state yet be give for the use of men there must of necessity be mean to appropriate them some way or other before they can be of any use or at all beneficial to any particular man the fruit or venison which nourish the wild indian who know no enclosure and be still tenant in common must be hi and so hi iepart of him that another can no longer have any right to it before it can do him any good for the support of hi life though the earth and all inferior creature be common to all men yet every man have property in hi own person this no body have any right to but himself the labour of hi body and the work of hi hand we may say be properly hi whatsoever then he remove out of the state that nature hath provide and leave it in he hath mixed hi labour with and join to it something that be hi own and thereby make it hi property it be by him remove from the common state nature hath place it in it hath by this labour something annexed to it that exclude the common right of other men for this labour be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can haveright to what that be once join to at least where there be enough and as good left in common for other he that be nourish by the acorn he pick up under an oak or the apple he gather from the tree in the wood have certainly appropriate them to himself no body can deny but the nourishment be hisask then when do they begin to be hi when he digest or when he eat or when he boil or when he bring them home or when he pick them up and it be plain if the first gathering make them not hi nothing els could that labour put distinction between them and common that add something to them more than nature the common mother of all have do and so they become hi private right and will any one say he have no right to those acorn or apple he thus appropriate because he have not the consent of all mankind to make them hi be it robbery thus to assume to himself what belong to all in common if such consent a that be necessary man have starve notwithstanding the plenty god have give him we see in common which remain so by compact that it be the take any part of what be common and remove it out of the state nature leave it in which begin the property without which the common be of no use and the taking of this or that part do not depend on the express consent of all the commoner thus the grass my horse have bite the turf my servant have cut and the orehave dig in any place where have right to them in common with other become my property without the assignation or consent of any body the labour that be mine remove them out of that common state they be in hath fix my property in them by make an explicit consent of every commoner necessary to any one appropriate to himself any part of what be give in common child or servant could not cut the meat which their father or master have provide for them in common without assign to every one hi peculiar part though the water run in the fountain be every one yet who can doubt but that in the pitcher be hi only who draw it out hi labour hath take it out of the hand of nature where it be common and belong equally to all her child and hath thereby appropriate it to himself thus this law of reason make the deer that indian who hath kill it it be allow to be hi good who hath bestow hi labour upon it though before it be the common right of every one and amongst those who be count the civilized part of mankind who have make and multiply positive law to determine property this original law of nature for the beginning of property in what be before common still take place and by virtue thereof what fish any one catch in the ocean that great and still remain common of mankind or what amber grise any one take up here be by the labour that remove it out of that common state nature leave it in make hi property who take that pain about it and even amongst u the hare that any one be hunt be think hi who pursue her during the chase for be beast that be still look upon a common and no man private possession whoever have employ so much labour about any of that kind a to find and pursue her have thereby remove her from the state of nature wherein she be common and hath begin property it will perhaps be object to this that if gather the acorn or other fruit of the earth c make right to them then any one may in gross as much a he will to which answer not so the same law of nature that do by this mean give u property do also bind that property too god have give u all thing richly tim viis the voice of reason confirm by inspiration but how far have he give it u to enjoy as much a any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoil so much he may by hi tabour fix property in whatever be beyond this be more than hi share and belongs to other nothing be make by god for man to spoil or destroy and thus consider the plenty of natural provision there be long time in the world and the few spender and to how small part of that provision the industry of one man could extend itself and in gross it to the prejudice of other especially keep within the bound set by reason of what might serve for hi use there could be then little room for quarrel or contention about property so establish but the chief matter of property be now not the fruit of the earth and the beast that subsist on it but the earth itself a that which take in and carry with it all the restthink it be plain that property in that too be acquire a the former a much land asman till plant improve cultivates and can use the product of so much be hi property he by hi labour do a it be inclose it from the common nor will it invalidate hi right to say every body els have an equal title to it and therefore he can not appropriate he can not in close without the consent of all hi fellowcommoners all mankind god when he give the world in common to all mankind command man also to labour and the penury of hi condition require it of him god and hi reason command him to subdue the earth ie improve it for the benefit of life and therein lay out something upon it that be hi own hi labour he that in obedience to this command of god subdue till and sow any part of it thereby annex to it something that be hi property which another have no title to nor could without injury take from him nor be this appropriation of any parcel of land by improve it any prejudice to any other man since there be still enough and as good left and more than the yet unprovided could use so that in effect there be never the less left for other because of hi enclosure for himself for he that leave as much a another can make use of do as good a take nothing at all no body could think himself injure by the drinking of another man though he take good draught who have whole river of the same water leave him to quench hi thirst and the case of land and water where there be enough of both be perfectly the same god give the world to men in common but since he give it them for their benefit and the great conveniencies of life they be capable to draw from it it can not be suppose he mean it should always remain common and uncultivated he give it to the use of the industrious and rational and labour be to be hi title to it not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious he that have a good left for hi improvement a be already take up needed not complain ought not to meddle with what be already improve by anothers labour if he do it be plain he desire the benefit of anothers pain which he have no right to and not the ground which god have give him in common with other to labour on and whereof there be a good left a that already possess and more than he know what to do with or hi industry could reach to it be true in land that be common in england or any other country where there be plenty of people under government who have money and commerce no one can inclose or appropriate any part without the consent of all hi fellowcommoners because this be left common by compact ie by the law of the land which be not to be violate and though it be common in respect of some men it be not so to all mankind but be the joint property of this country or this parish besides the remainder after such enclosure would not be as good to the rest of the commoner a the whole be when they could all make use of the whole whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great common of the world it be quite otherwise the law man be under be rather for appropriate god command and hi want force him to labour that be hi property which could not be take from him whereever he have fix it and hence subduing or cultivate the earth and have dominion we see be join together the one give title to the other so that god by command to subdue give authority so far to appropriate and the condition of human life which require labour and material to work on necessarily introduces private possession the measure of property nature have well set by the extent of men labour and the conveniencies of life no man labour could subdue or appropriate all nor could hi enjoyment consume more than small part so that it be impossible for any man this way to intrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself property to the prejudice of hi neighbour who would still have room for as good and a large possession after the other have take out hi a before it be appropriate this measure do confine every man possession to very moderate proportion and such a he might appropriate to himself without injury to any body in the first age of the world when men be more in danger to be lose by wander from their company in the then vast wilderness of the earth than to be straiten for want of room to plant in and the same measure may be allow still without prejudice to any body as full a the world seem for suppose man or family in the state they be at first peopling of the world by the child of adam or noah let him plant in some inland vacant place of america we shall find that the possession he could make himself upon the measure we have give would not be very large nor even to this day prejudice the rest of mankind or give them reason to complain or think themselves injure by this mans incroachment though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corner of the world and do infinitely exceed the small number be at the beginning nay the extent of ground be of so little value without labour that have hear it affirm that in spain itself man may be permit to plough sow and reap without be disturb upon land he have no other title to but only hi make use of it but on the contrary the inhabitant think themselves behold to him who by hi industry on neglected and consequently waste land have increase the stock of corn which they want but be this a it will which lay no stress on this dare boldly affirm that the same rule of propriety viz that every man should have as much a he could make use of would hold still in the world without straiten any body since there be land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabitant have not the invention of money and the tacit agreement of men to putvalue on it introduce by consent large possession and right to them which how it have doneshall by and by shew more at large this be certain that in the beginning before the desire of have more than man need have alter the intrinsic value of thing which depend only on their usefulness to the life of man or have agree that little piece of yellow metal which would keep without waste or decay should be worth great piece of flesh or whole heap of corn though men have right to appropriate by their labour each one of himself a much of the thing of nature a he could use yet this could not be much nor to the prejudice of other where the same plenty be still leave to those who would use the same industry to which let me add that he who appropriate land to himself by hi labour do not lessen but increase the common stock of mankind for the provision serve to the support of human life produce by one acre of inclosed and cultivated land be to speak much within compass ten time more than those which be yield by an acre of land of an equal richness lie waste in common and therefore he that inclose land and have great plenty of the conveniencies of life from ten acre than he could have from an hundred leave to nature may truly be say to give ninety acre to mankind for hi labour now supply him with provision out of ten acre which be but the product of an hundred lying in commonhave here rat the improved land very low in make it product but as ten to one when it be much nearer an hundred to one forask whether in the wild wood and uncultivated waste of america leave to nature without any improvement tillage or husbandrythousand acre yield the needy and wretched inhabitant a many conveniencies of life a ten acre of equally fertile land do in devonshire where they be well cultivate before the appropriation of land he who gather a much of the wild fruit kill caught or tame a many of the beast a he could he that so imployed hi pain about any of the spontaneous product of nature a any way to alter them from the state which nature put them in by place any of hi labour on them do thereby acquire propriety in them but if they perish in hi possession without their due use if the fruit rot or the venison putrified before he could spend it he offend against the common law of nature and be liable to be punish he invade hi neighbour share for he have no right far than hi use call for any of them and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life the same measure govern the possession of land too whatsoever he till and reap lay up and make use of before it spoil that be hi peculiar right whatsoever he enclose and could fee and make use of the cattle and product be also hi but if either the grass of hi enclosure rot on the ground or the fruit of hi plant perish without gathering and lay up this part of the earth notwithstanding hi enclosure be still to be look on a waste and might be the possession of any other thus at the begin cain might take a much ground a he could till and make it hi own land and yet leave enough to abel sheep to fee onfew acre would serve for both their possession but a family increase and industry inlarged their stock their possession inlarged with the need of them but yet it be commonly without any fixed property in the ground they make use of till they incorporate settle themselves together and built city and then by consent they come in time to set out the bound of their distinct territory and agree on limit between them and their neighbour and by law within themselves settle the property of those of the same society for we see that in that part of the world which be first inhabit and therefore like to be best people even a low down a abrahams time they wander with their flock and their herd which be their substance freely up and down and this abraham do in country where he be strange whence it be plain that at least great part of the land lay in common that the inhabitant value it not nor claimed property in any more than they make use of but when there be not room enough in the same place for their herd to fee together they by consent a abraham and lot do gen xiiiseparated and inlarged their pasture where it best like them and for the same reason esau go from hi father and hi brother and plant in mount seir gen and thus without suppose any private dominion and property in adam over all the world exclusive of all other men which can no way be prove nor any one property be make out from it but suppose the world give a it be to the child of men in common we see how labour could make men distinct title to several parcel of it for their private us wherein there could be no doubt of right no room for quarrel nor be it so strange a perhaps before consideration it may appear that the property of labour should be able to overbalance the community of land for it be labour indeed that put the difference of value on every thing and let any one consider what the difference be between an acre of land plant with tobacco or sugar sown with wheat or barley and an acre of the same land lie in common without any husbandry upon it and he will find that the improvement of labour make the far great part of the valuethink it will be but very modest computation to say that of the product of the earth useful to the life of man nine tenth be the effect of labour nay if we will rightly estimate thing a they come to our use and cast up the several expences about them what in them be purely owe to nature and what to labour we shall find that in most of them ninetynine hundredth be wholly to be put on the account of labour there can not be clear demonstration of any thing than several nation of the american be of this who be rich in land and poor in all the comfort of life whom nature have furnish as liberally a any other people with the material of plenty iefruitful soil apt to produce in abundance what might serve for food raiment and delight yet for want of improve it by labour have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy and king of large and fruitful territory there feed lodge and be clad bad than daylabourer in england to make this little clear let u but trace some of the ordinary provision of life through their several progress before they come to our use and see how much they receive of their value from human industry bread wine and cloth be thing of daily use and great plenty yet notwithstanding acorn water and leave or skin must be our bread drink and cloathing do not labour furnish u with these more useful commodity for whatever bread be more worth than acorn wine than water and cloth or silk than leave skin or moss that be wholly owe to labour and industry the one of these be the food and raiment which unassisted nature furnishes u with the other provision which our industry and pain prepare for u which how much they exceed the other in value when any one hath compute he will then see how much labour make the far great part of the value of thing we enjoy in this world and the ground which produce the material be scarce to be reckon in a any or at most but very small part of it so little that even amongst u land that be leave wholly to nature that hath no improvement of pasturage tillage or planting be call a indeed it be waste and we shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing this shew how much number of men be to be prefer to largeness of dominion and that the increase of land and the right employing of them be the great art of government and that prince who shall be so wise and godlike a by establish law of liberty to secure protection and encouragement to the honest industry of mankind against the oppression of power and narrowness of party will quickly be too hard for hi neighbour but this by the by to return to the argument in hand an acre of land that bear here twenty bushel of wheat and another in america which with the same husbandry would do the like be without doubt of the same natural intrinsic value but yet the benefit mankind receive from the one in year be worth l and from the other possibly not worth penny if all the profit an indian receive from it be to be value and sell here at leastmay truly say not one thousandth it be labour then which put the great part of value upon land without which it would scarcely be worth any thing it be to that we owe the great part of all it useful product for all that the straw bran bread of that acre of wheat be more worth than the product of an acre of as good land which lie waste be all the effect of labour for it be not barely the ploughman pain the reaper and thresher toil and the baker sweat be to be count into the bread we eat the labour of those who break the ox who dig and work the iron and stone who fell and frame the timber employ about the plough mill oven or any other utensil which be vast number requisite to this corn from it be fee to be sow to it be make bread must all be charge on the account of labour and receive a an effect of that nature and the earth furnish only the almost worthless material a in themselves it would best range catalogue of thing that industry provide and make use of about every loaf of bread before it come to our use if we could trace them iron wood leather bark timber stone brick coal lime cloth die drug pitch tar mast rope and all the material make use of in the ship that bring any of the commodity make use of by any of the workman to any part of the work all which it would be almost impossible at least too long to reckon up from all which it be evident that though the thing of nature be give in common yet man by be master of himself and proprietor of hi own person and the action or labour of it have still in himself the great foundation of property and that which make up the great part of what he apply to the support or comfort of hi be when invention and art have improve the conveniencies of life be perfectly hi own and do not belong in common to other thus labour in the beginning gaveright of property wherever any one be please to employ it upon what be common which remainedlong while the far great part and be yet more than mankind make use of men at first for the most part content themselves with what unassisted nature offer to their necessity and though afterwards in some part of the world where the increase of people and stock with the use of money have make land scarce and so of some value the several community settle the bound of their distinct territory and by law within themselves regulate the property of the private men of their society and so by compact and agreement settle the property which labour and industry begin and the league that have be make between several state and kingdom either expresly or tacitly disown all claim and right to the land in the other possession have by common consent give up their pretence to their natural common right which originally they have to those country and so have by positive agreement settle property amongst themselves in distinct part and parcel of the earth yet there be still great tract of ground to be find which the inhabitant thereof not have join with the rest of mankind in the consent of the use of their common money lie waste and be more than the people who dwell on it do or can make use of and so still lie in common tho this can scarce happen amongst that part of mankind that have consent to the use of money the great part of thing really useful to the life of man and such a the necessity of subsist make the first commoner of the world look after a it doth the american now be generally thing of short duration such a if they be not consume by use will decay and perish of themselves gold silver and diamond be thing that fancy or agreement hath put the value on more than real use and the necessary support of life now of those good thing which nature hath provide in common every one have right a hath be say to as much a he could use and property in all that he could effect with hi labour all that hi industry could extend to to alter from the state nature have put it in be hi he that gather hundred bushel of acorn or apple have thereby property in them they be hi good as soon a gather he be only to look that he use them before they spoil els he take more than hi share and rob other and indeed it be foolish thing as well a dishonest to hoard up more than he could make use of if he give away part to any body els so that it perish not uselesly in hi possession these he also make use of and if he also barter away plum that would have rot in week for nut that would last good for hi eating whole year he do no injury he waste not the common stock destroy no part of the portion of good that belong to other so long a nothing perish uselesly in hi hand again if he would give hi nut for piece of metal please with it colour or exchange hi sheep for shell or wool forsparkling pebble ordiamond and keep those by him all hi life he invade not the right of other he might heap up as much of these durable thing a he please the exceeding of the bound of hi just property not lie in the largeness of hi possession but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it and thus come in the use of money some lasting thing that men might keep without spoil and that by mutual consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful but perishable support of life and a different degree of industry be apt to give men possession in different proportion so this invention of money give them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them for suppose an island separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world wherein there be but an hundred family but there be sheep horse and cow with other useful animal wholsome fruit and land enough for corn for hundred thousand time a many but nothing in the island either because of it commonness or perishableness fit to supply the place of money what reason could any one have there to enlarge hi possession beyond the use of hi family and plentiful supply to it consumption either in what their own industry produce or they could barter for like perishable useful commodity with other where there be not some thing both lasting and scarce and so valuable to be hoard up there men will not be apt to enlarge their possession of land be it never so rich never so free for them to take forask what woul dman value ten thousand or an hundred thousand acre of excellent land ready cultivate and well stock too with cattle in the middle of the inland part of america where he have no hope of commerce with other part of the world to draw money to him by the sale of the product it would not be worth the enclosing and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature whatever be more than would supply the conveniencies of life to be have there for him and hi family thus in the begin all the world be america and more so than that be now for no such thing a money be any where know find out something that hath the use and value of money amongst hi neighbour you shall see the same man will begin presently to enlarge hi possession but since gold and silver be little useful to the life of man in proportion to food raiment and carriage have it value only from the consent of men whereof labour yet make in great part the measure it be plain that men have agree to disproportionate and unequal possession of the earth they have by tacit and voluntary consent find outway how man may fairly possess more land than he himself can use the product of by receive in exchange for the over plus gold and silver which may be hoard up without injury to any one these metal not spoil or decay in the hand of the possessor this partage of thing in an inequality of private possession men have make practicable out of the bound of society and without compact only by put value on gold and silver and tacitly agree in the use of money for in government the law regulate the right of property and the possession of land be determine by positive constitution and thusthink it be very easy to conceive without any difficulty how labour could at first begintitle of property in the common thing of nature and how the spending it upon our us bound it so that there could then be no reason of quarrel about title nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it give right and conveniency go together for a man have right to all he could employ hi labour upon so he have no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of this left no room for controversy about the title nor for encroachment on the right of other what portion man carve to himself be easily see and it be useless as well a dishonest to carve himself too much or take more than he need of paternal power it may perhaps be censure a an impertinent criticism indiscourse of this nature to find fault with word and name that have obtain in the world and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new one when the old be apt to lead men into mistake a this of paternal power probably have do which seem so to place the power of parent over their child wholly in the father a if the mother have no share in it whereas if we consult reason or revelation we shall find she hath an equal title this may give one reason to ask whether this might not be more properly call parental power for whatever obligation nature and the right of generation lay on child it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent cause of it and accordingly we see the positive law of god every where join them together without distinction when it command the obedience of child honour thy father and thy mother exod whosoever curseth hi father or hi mother lev ye shall fear every man hi mother and hi father lev xixchildren obey your parent c eph viis the stile of the old and new testament had but this one thing be well consider without look any deeper into the matter it might perhaps have keep men from run into those gross mistake they have make about this power of parent which however it might without any great harshness bear the name of absolute dominion and regal authority when under the title of paternal power it seem appropriate to the father would yet have found but oddly and in the very name shew the absurdity if this suppose absolute power over child have be call parental and thereby have discover that it belong to the mother too for it will but very ill serve the turn of those men who contend so much for the absolute power and authority of the fatherhood a they call it that the mother should have any share in it and it would have but ill support the monarchy they contend for when by the very name it appear that that fundamental authority from whence they would derive their government of single person only be not place in one but two person jointly but to let this of names pas though have say above chap that all men by nature be equalcannot be suppose to understand all sort of equality age or virtue may give men just precedency excellency of part and merit may place other above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefit other to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respect may have make it due and yet all this consist with the equality which all men be in in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which be the equality there spoke of as proper to the business in hand be that equal right that every man hath to hi natural freedom without be subject to the will or authority of any other man childrenconfess be not bear in this full state of equality though they be bear to it their parent have sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it be but temporary one the bond of this subjection be like the swaddle clothes they art wrapt up in and support by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason a they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave man at hi own free disposal adam be create perfect man hi body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason and so be capable from the first instant of hi be to provide for hi own support and preservation and govern hi action accord to the dictate of the law of reason which god have implant in him from him the world be people with hi descendant who be all born infant weak and helpless without knowledge or understand but to supply the defect of this imperfect state till the improvement of growth and age hath remove them adam and eve and after them all parent be by the law of nature under an obligation to preserve nourish and educate the child they have beget not a their own workmanship but the workmanship of their own maker the almighty to whom they be to be accountable for them the law that be to govern adam be the same that be to govern all hi posterity the law of reason but hi offspring have another way of entrance into the world different from him by natural birth that produce them ignorant and without the use of reason they be not presently under that law for no body can be under law which be not promulgate to him and this law be promulgate or make know by reason only he that be not come to the use of hi reason can not be say to be under this law and adam child be not presently as soon a bear under this law of reason be not presently free for law in it true notion be not so much the limitation a the direction of free and intelligent agent to hi proper interest and prescribe no farther than be for the general good of those under that law could they be happier without it the law a an useless thing would of itself vanish and that ill deserve the name of confinement which hedge u in only from bog and precipice so that however it may be mistake the end of law be not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the state of created being capable of law where there be no law there be no freedom for liberty be to be free from restraint and violence from other which can not be where there be no law but freedom be not a we be toldliberty for every man to do what he list for who could be free when every other man humour might domineer over him butliberty to dispose and order a he list hi person action possession and hi whole property within the allowance of those law under which he be and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow hi own the power then that parent have over their child arise from that duty which be incumbent on them to take care of their offspring during the imperfect state of childhood to inform the mind and govern the action of their yet ignorant nonage till reason shall take it place and ease them of that trouble be what the child want and the parent be bind to for god have give man an understanding to direct hi action have allow him freedom of will and liberty of act a properly belong thereunto within the bound of that law he be under but whilst he be in an estate wherein he have not understanding of hi own to direct hi will he be not to have any will of hi own to follow he that understand for him must will for him too he must prescribe to hi will and regulate hi action but when he come to the estate that make hi father freeman the son be freeman too this hold in all the law man be under whether natural or civil is man under the law of nature what make him free of that law what give him free disposing of hi property accord to hi own will within the compass of that lawanswerstate of maturity wherein he might be suppose capable to know that law that so he might keep hi action within the bound of it when he have acquire that state he be presume to know how far that law be to be hi guide and how far he may make use of hi freedom and so come to have it till then some body els must guide him who be presume to know how far the law allow liberty if such state of reason such an age of discretion make him free the same shall make hi son free too be man under the law of england what make him free of that law that be to have the liberty to dispose of hi action and possession accord to hi own will within the permission of that lawcapacity of know that law which be suppose by that law at the age of one and twenty year and in some case sooner if this make the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allow the son to have no will but he be to be guide by the will of hi father or guardian who be to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitute deputy in hi trust if he hath not providedtutor to govern hi son during hi minority during hi want of understand the law take care to do it some other must govern him and bewill to him till he hath attain tostate of freedom and hi understanding be fit to take the government of hi will but after that the father and son be equally free as much a tutor and pupil after nonage equally subject of the same law together without any dominion leave in the father over the life liberty or estate of hi son whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature or under the positive law of an established government but if through defect that may happen out of the ordinary course of nature any one come not to such degree of reason wherein he might be suppose capable of know the law and so living within the rule of it he be never capable of be free man he be never let loose to the disposure of hi own will because he know no bound to it have not understand it proper guide but be continue under the tuition and government of other all the time hi own understanding be uncapable of that charge and so lunatic and ideots be never set free from the government of their parent child who be not a yet come unto those year whereat they may have and innocent which be exclude by natural defect from ever have thirdly madman which for the present can not possibly have the use of right reason to guide themselves have for their guide the reason that guideth other men which be tutor over them to seek and procure their good for them say hooker eccl pol lib i secall which seem no more than that duty which god and nature have lay on man as well a other creature to preserve their offspring till they can be able to shift for themselves and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of parent regal authority thus we be born free a we be bear rational not that we have actually the exercise of either age that bring one brings with it the other too and thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to parent may consist together and be both found on the same principlechild be free by hi father title by hi father understand which be to govern him till he hath it of hi own the freedom of man at year of discretion and the subjection of child to hi parent whilst yet short of that age be so consistent and so distinguishable that the most blinded contender for monarchy by right of fatherhood can not miss this difference the most obstinate can not but allow their consistency for be their doctrine all true be the right heir of adam now know and by that title settle monarch in hi throne invest with all the absolute unlimited power sir robert filmer talk of if he should die as soon a hi heir be bear must not the child notwithstanding he be never so free never so much sovereign be in subjection to hi mother and nurse to tutor and governor till age and education bring him reason and ability to govern himself and other the necessity of hi life the health of hi body and the information of hi mind would require him to be direct by the will of other and not hi own and yet will any one think that this restraint and subjection be inconsistent with or spoil him of that liberty or sovereignty he hadright to or give away hi empire to those who have the government of hi nonage this government over him only prepare him the good and sooner for it if any body should ask me when my son be of age to be freeshall answer just when hi monarch be of age to govern but at what time say the judicious hooker eccl pol l i secta man may be say to have attain so far forth the use of reason a sufficeth to make him capable of those law whereby he be then bind to guide hi action this isgreat deal more easy for sense to discern than for any one by skill and learning to determine commonwealth themselves take notice of and allow that there be time when men be to begin to act like free men and therefore till that time require not oath of fealty or allegiance or other public owning of or submission to the government of their country the freedom then of man and liberty of act accord to hi own will be ground on hi have reason which be able to instruct him in that law he be to govern himself by and make him know how far he be leave to the freedom of hi own will to turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty before he have reason to guide him be not the allow him the privilege of hi nature to be free but to thrust him out amongst brute and abandon him to state a wretched and as much beneath that ofman a theirs this be that which put the authority into the parent hand to govern the minority of their child god hath make it their business to employ this care on their offspring and hath place in them suitable inclination of tenderness and concern to temper this power to apply it a hi wisdom design it to the children good as long a they should need to be under it but what reason can hence advance this care of the parent due to their offspring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the father whose power reach no farther than by such discipline a he find most effectual to give such strength and health to their body such vigour and rectitude to their mind a may best fit hi child to be most useful to themselves and other and if it be necessary to hi condition to make them work when they be able for their own subsistence but in this power the mother too have her share with the father nay this power so little belongs to the father by any peculiar right of nature but only a he be guardian of hi child that when he quit hi care of them he lose hi power over them which go along with their nourishment and education to which it be inseparably annexed and it belong as much to the fosterfather of an exposed child a to the natural father of another so little power do the bare act of beget give man over hi issue if all hi care end there and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority of father and what will become of this paternal power in that part of the world where one woman hath more than one husband at time or in those part of america where when the husband and wife part which happen frequently the child be all leave to the mother follow her and be wholly under her care and provision if the father die whilst the child be young do they not naturally every where owe the same obedience to their mother during their minority a to their father be he alive and will any one say that the mother hath legislative power over her child that she can make standing rule which shall be of perpetual obligation by which they ought to regulate all the concern of their property and bind their liberty all the course of their life or can she inforce the observation of them with capital punishment for this be the proper power of the magistrate of which the father hath not so much a the shadow hi command over hi child be but temporary and reach not their life or property it be but help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonagediscipline necessary to their education and though father may dispose of hi own possession a he please when hi child be out of danger of perish for want yet hi power extend not to the life or good which either their own industry or anothers bounty have make theirs nor to their liberty neither when they be once arrive to the in franchisement of the year of discretion the father empire then cease and he can from thence forward no more dispose of the liberty of hi son than that of any other man and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction from which man may withdraw himself have license from divine authority to leave father and mother and cleave to hi wife but though there be time when child come to be a free from subjection to the will and command of hi father a the father himself be free from subjection to the will of any body els and they be each under no other restraint but that which be common to them both whether it be the law of nature or municipal law of their country yet this freedom exempt not son from that honour which he ought by the law of god and nature to pay hi parent god have make the parent instrument in hi great design of continue the race of mankind and the occasion of life to their child a he hath lay on them an obligation to nourish preserve and bring up their offspring so he have lay on the child perpetual obligation of honour their parent which contain in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shew by all outward expression tie up the child from any thing that may ever injure or affront disturb or endanger the happiness or life of those from whom he receive hi and engage him in all action of defence relief assistance and comfort of those by whose mean he enter into be and have be make capable of any enjoyment of life from this obligation no state no freedom can absolve child but this be very far from give parent power of command over their child or an authority to make law and dispose a they please of their life or liberty it be one thing to owe honour respect gratitude and assistance another to require an absolute obedience and submission the honour due to parentsmonarch in hi throne owe hi mother and yet this lessen not hi authority nor subject him to her government the subjection of minor place in the father temporary government which terminate with the minority of the child and the honour due from child place in the parent perpetual right to respect reverence support and compliance too more or less a the father care cost and kindness in hi education have be more or less this end not with minority but hold in all part and condition of man life the want of distinguish these two power viz that which the father hath in the right of tuition during minority and the right of honour all hi life may perhaps have cause great part of the mistake about this matter for to speak properly of them the first of these be rather the privilege of child and duty of parent than any prerogative of paternal power the nourishment and education of their child be charge so incumbent on parent for their children good that nothing can absolve them from take care of it and though the power of commanding and chastise them go along with it yet god hath woven into the principle of human nature such tenderness for their offspring that there be little fear that parent should use their power with too much rigour the excess be seldom on the severe side the strong byass of nature draw the other way and therefore god almighty when he would express hi gentle deal with the israelite he tell them that though he chasten them he chasten them a man chasten hi son deut viiiie with tenderness and affection and keep them under no severer discipline than what be absolutely best for them and have be less kindness to have slacken this be that power to which child be command obedience that the pain and care of their parent may not be increase or ill reward on the other side honour and support all that which gratitude require to return for the benefit receive by and from them be the indispensable duty of the child and the proper privilege of the parent this be intend for the parent advantage a the other be for the child though education the parent duty seem to have most power because the ignorance and infirmity of childhood stand in need of restraint and correction which be visible exercise of rule and kind of dominion and that duty which be comprehend in the word honour require less obedience though the obligation be strong on grown than young child for who can think the command child obey your parent require in man that have child of hi own the same submission to hi father a it do in hi yet young child to him and that by this precept he be bind to obey all hi father command if out of conceit of authority he should have the indiscretion to treat him still asboy the first part then of paternal power or rather duty which be education belongs so to the father that it terminate at certain season when the business of education be over it cease of itself and be also alienable before for man may put the tuition of hi son in other hand and he that have make hi son an apprentice to another have discharge him during that time of great part of hi obedience both to himself and to hi mother but all the duty of honour the other part remain never the less entire to them nothing can cancel that it be so inseparable from them both that the father authority can not dispossess the mother of this right nor can any man discharge hi son from honour her that bore him but both these be very far from power to make law and enforce them with penalty that may reach estate liberty limb and life the power of command end with nonage and though after that honour and respect support and defence and whatsoever gratitude can oblige man to for the high benefit he be naturally capable of be always due from son to hi parent yet all this put no scepter into the father hand no sovereign power of command he have no dominion over hi son property or action nor any right that hi will should prescribe to hi son in all thing however it may become hi son in many thing not very inconvenient to him and hi family to pay deference to it a man may owe honour and respect to an ancient or wise man defence to hi child or friend relief and support to the distressed and gratitude to benefactor to such degree that all he have all he can do can not sufficiently pay it but all these give no authority no right to any one of make law over him from whom they be owe and it be plain all this be due not only to the bare title of father not only because a have be say it be owe to the mother too but because these obligation to parent and the degree of what be require of child may be vary by the different care and kindness trouble and expence which be often employ upon one child more than another this shew the reason how it come to pass that parent in society where they themselves be subject retain power over their child and have as much right to their subjection a those who be in the state of nature which could not possibly be if all political power be only paternal and that in truth they be one and the same thing for then all paternal power be in the prince the subject could naturally have none of it but these two power political and paternal be so perfectly distinct and separate be build upon so different foundation and give to so different end that every subject that be father have as much paternal power over hi child a the prince have over hi and every prince that have parent owe them a much filial duty and obedience a the meanest of hi subject do to theirs and can therefore contain not any part or degree of that kind of dominion which prince or magistrate have over hi subject though the obligation on the parent to bring up their child and the obligation on child to honour their parent contain all the power on the one hand and submission on the other which be proper to this relation yet there be another power ordinarily in the father whereby he hastie on the obedience of hi child which tho it be common to him with other men yet the occasion of shew it almost consich tho it be common to him with other men yet the occasion of shew it almost constantly happen to father in their private family and the instance of it elsewhere be rare and less take notice of it pass in the world forpart of paternal jurisdiction and this be the power men generally have to bestow their estate on those who please them best the possession of the father be the expectation and inheritance of the child ordinarily in certain proportion accord to the law and custom of each country yet it be commonly in the father power to bestow it with more sparing or liberal hand accord a the behaviour of this or that child hath comport with hi will and humour this be no small tie on the obedience of child and there be always annex to the enjoyment of landsubmission to the government of the country of which that land ispart it have be commonly suppose thatfather could oblige hi posterity to that government of which he himself wassubject and that hi compact hold them whereas it be onlynecessary condition annex to the land and the inheritance of an estate which be under that government reach only those who will take it on that condition and so be no natural tie or engagement butvoluntary submission for every man child be by nature as free a himself or any of hi ancestor ever be may whilst they be in that freedom choose what society they will join themselves to what commonwealth they will put themselves under but if they will enjoy the inheritance of their ancestor they must take it on the same term their ancestor have it and submit to all the condition annex to suchpossession by this power indeed father oblige their child to obedience to themselves even when they be past minority and most commonly too subject them to this or that political power but neither of these by any peculiar right of fatherhood but by the reward they have in their hand to inforce and recompence suchcompliance and be no more power than whatfrench man have over an english man who by the hope of an estate he will leave him will certainly havestrong tie on hi obedience and if when it be leave him he will enjoy it he must certainly take it upon the condition annex to the possession of land in that country where it lie whether it be france or england to conclude then tho the father power of command extend no farther than the minority of hi child and to degree only fit for the discipline and government of that age and tho that honour and respect and all that which the latin call piety which they indispensably owe to their parent all their lifetime and in all estate with all that support and defence be due to them give the father no power of govern ie make law and enact penalty on hi child though by all this he have no dominion over the property or action of hi son yet it be obvious to conceive how easy it be in the first age of the world and in place still where the thinness of people give family leave to separate into unpossessed quarter and they have room to remove or plant themselves in yet vacant habitation for the father of the family to become the prince of it he have beenruler from the beginning of the infancy of hi child and since without some government it would be hard for them to live together it be likeliest it should by the express or tacit consent of the child when they be grow up be in the father where it seem without any change barely to continue when indeed nothing more be require to it than the permit the father to exercise alone in hi family that executive power of the law of nature which every free man naturally hath and by that permission resign up to himmonarchical power whilst they remain in it but that this be not by any paternal right but only by the consent of hi child be evident from hence that no body doubt but ifstranger whom chance or business have bring to hi family have there kill any of hi child or commit any other fact he might condemn and put him to death or otherwise have punish him as well a any of hi child which it be impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal authority over one who be not hi child but by virtue of that executive power of the law of nature which asman he hadright to and he alone could punish him in hi family where the respect of hi child have lay by the exercise of suchpower to give way to the dignity and authority they be willing should remain in him above the rest of hi family it be no improbable opinion therefore which the archphilosopher be of that the chief person in every houshold be always a it wereking so when number of housholds join themselves in civil society together king be the first kind of governor amongst them which be also a it seemeth the reason why the name of father continue still in them who of father be make ruler a also the ancient custom of governor to do a melchizedec and be king to exercise the office of priest which father do at the first grow perhaps by the same occasion howbeit this be not the only kind of regiment that have be receive in the world the inconvenience of one kind have cause sundry other to be devise so that inword all public regiment of what kind soever seemeth evidently to have rise from the deliberate advice consultation and composition between men judge it convenient and behoveful there be no impossibility in nature consider by itself but that man might have live without any public regiment hooker eccl pol lib i sect thus it be easy and almost natural for child by tacit and scarce avoidable consent to make way for the father authority and government they have be accustom in their childhood to follow hi direction and to refer their little difference to him and when they be men who fitter to rule them their little property and less covetousness seldom afford great controversy and when any should arise where could they havefitter umpire than he by whose care they have every one be sustain and bring up and who hadtenderness for them all it be no wonder that they make no distinction betwixt minority and full age nor look after one and twenty or any other age that might make them the free disposers of themselves and fortune when they could have no desire to be out of their pupilage the government they have be under during it continue still to be more their protection than restraint and they could no where findgreater security to their peace liberty and fortune than in the rule offather thus the natural father of family by an insensible change become the politic monarch of them too and a they chance to live long and leave able and worthy heir for several succession or otherwise so they lay the foundation of hereditary or elective kingdom under several constitution and mannors accord a chance contrivance or occasion happen to mould them but if prince have their title in their father right and it besufficient proof of the natural right of father to political authority because they commonly be those in whose hand we find de facto the exercise of governmentsay if this argument be good it will as strongly prove that all prince nay prince only ought to be priest since it be as certain that in the begin the father of the family be priest a that he be ruler in hi own houshold of political or civil society god have make man such creature that in hi own judgment it be not good for him to be alone put him under strong obligation of necessity convenience and inclination to drive him into society as well a fit him with understanding and language to continue and enjoy it the first society be between man and wife which give begin to that between parent and child to which in time that between master and servant come to be add and though all these might and commonly do meet together and make up but one family wherein the master or mistress of it have some sort of rule proper tofamily each of these or all together come short of political society a we shall see if we consider the different end tie and bound of each of these conjugal society be make by voluntary compact between man and woman and tho it consist chiefly in such communion and right in one anothers body a be necessary to it chief end procreation yet it draw with it mutual support and assistance and communion of interest too as necessary not only to unite their care and affection but also necessary to their common offspring who haveright to be nourish and maintain by them till they be able to provide for themselves for the end of conjunction between male and female be not barely procreation but the continuation of the specie this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last even after procreation so long a be necessary to the nourishment and support of the young one who be to be sustain even after procreation so long a be necessary to the nourishment and support of the young one who be to be sustain by those that get them till they be able to shift and provide for themselves this rule which the infinite wise maker hath set to the work of hi hand we find the inferior creature steadily obey in those viviparous animal which fee on grass the conjunction between male and female last no long than the very act of copulation because the teat of the dam be sufficient to nourish the young till it be able to fee on grass the male only beget but concern not himself for the female or young to whose sustenance he can contribute nothing but in beast of prey the conjunction last longer because the dam not be able well to subsist herself and nourish her numerous offspring by her own prey alonemore laborious as well a more dangerous way of living than by feed on grass the assistance of the male be necessary to the maintenance of their common family which can not subsist till they be able to prey for themselves but by the joint care of male and female the same be to be observe in all bird except some domestic one where plenty of food excuse the cock from feed and take care of the young brood whose young need food in the nest the cock and hen continue mate till the young be able to use their wing and provide for themselves and here in think lie the chief if not the only reason why the male and female in mankind be tie to long conjunction than other creature viz because the female be capable of conceive and de facto be commonly with child again and bring forth too new birth long before the former be out of dependency for support on hi parent help and able to shift for himself and have all the assistance be due to him from hi parent whereby the father who be bind to take care for those he hath beget be under an obligation to continue in conjugal society with the same woman long than other creature whose young be able to subsist of themselves before the time of procreation return again the conjugal bond dissolve of itself and they be at liberty till hymen at hi usual anniversary season summons them again to chuse new mate wherein one can not but admire the wisdom of the great creator who have give to man foresight and an ability to lay up for the future as well a to supply the present necessity hath make it necessary that society of man and wife should be more lasting than of male and female amongst other creature that so their industry might be encourage and their interest well unite to make provision and lay up good for their common issue which uncertain mixture or easy and frequent solution of conjugal society would mightily disturb but tho these be tie upon mankind which make the conjugal bond more firm and last in man than the other specie of animal yet it would give one reason to enquire why this compact where procreation and education be secure and inheritance take care for may not be make determinable either by consent or at certain time or upon certain condition as well a any other voluntary compact there be no necessity in the nature of the thing nor to the end of it that it should always be for lifemean to such a be under no restraint of any positive law which ordain all such contract to be perpetual but the husband and wife though they have but one common concern yet have different understanding will unavoidably sometimes have different will too it therefore be necessary that the last determination i e the rule should be place somewhere it naturally fall to the man share a the abler and the strong but this reaching but to the thing of their common interest and property leave the wife in the full and free possession of what by contract be her peculiar right and give the husband no more power over her life than she have over hi the power of the husband be so far from that of an absolute monarch that the wife have in many casesliberty to separate from him where natural right or their contract allow it whether that contract be make by themselves in the state of nature or by the custom or law of the country they live in and the child upon such separation fall to the father or mother lot a such contract do determine for all the end of marriage be to be obtain under politic government as well a in the state of nature the civil magistrate doth not abridge the right or power of either naturally necessary to those end viz procreation and mutual support and assistance whilst they be together but only decide any controversy that may arise between man and wife about them if it be otherwise and that absolute sovereignty and power of life and death naturally belong to the husband and be necessary to the society between man and wife there could be no matrimony in any of those country where the husband be allow no such absolute authority but the end of matrimony require no such power in the husband the condition of conjugal society put it not in him it be not at all necessary to that state conjugal society could subsist and attain it end without it nay community of good and the power over them mutual assistance and maintenance and other thing belong to conjugal society might be vary and regulate by that contract which unite man and wife in that society as far a may consist with procreation and the bring up of child till they could shift for themselves nothing be necessary to any society that be not necessary to the end for which it be make the society betwixt parent and child and the distinct right and power belong respectively to themhave treat of so largely in the foregoing chapter thatshall not here need to say any thing of it andthink it be plain that it be far different from politic society master and servant be names as old a history but give to those of far different condition for freeman make himself servant to another by sell him forcertain time the service he undertake to do in exchange for wage he be to receive and though this commonly put him into the family of hi master and under the ordinary discipline thereof yet it give the master but temporary power over him and no great than what be contain in the contract between them but there be another sort of servant which by peculiar name we call slave who be captive take injust war be by the right of nature subject to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their master these men have assay forfeit their life and with it their liberty and lose their estate and be in the state of slavery not capable of any property can not in that state be consider a any part of civil society the chief end whereof be the preservation of property let u therefore considermaster of family with all these subordinate relation of wife child servant and slave unite under the domestic rule of family which what resemblance soever it may have in it order office and number too withlittle commonwealth yet be very far from it both in it constitution power and end or if it must be think monarchy and the paterfamilias the absolute monarch in it absolute monarchy will have but very shattered and short power when it be plain by what have be say before that the master of the family have very distinct and differently limited power both a to time and extent over those several person that be in it for except the slave and the family be as much family and hi power as paterfamilias a great whether there be any slave in hi family or no he have no legislative power of life and death over any of them and none too but what mistress offamily may have as well a he and he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole family who have but very limited one over every individual in it but how family or any other society of men differ from that which be properly political society we shall best see by consider wherein political society itself consist man be bear a have be prove with title to perfect freedom and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the right and privilege of the law of nature equally with any other man or number of men in the world hath by nature power not only to preserve hi property that be hi life liberty and estate against the injury and attempt of other men but to judge of and punish the breach of that law in other a he be persuade the offence deserve even with death itself in crime where the heinousness of the fact in hi opinion require it but because no political society can be nor subsist without have in itself the power to preserve the property and in order thereunto punish the offence of all those of that society there and there only be political society where every one of the member hath quit this natural power resign it up into the hand of the community in all case that exclude him not from appeal for protection to the law establish by it and thus all private judgment of every particular member be exclude the community come to be umpire by settled standing rule indifferent and the same to all party and by men have authority from the community for the execution of those rule decide all the difference that may happen between any member of that society concern any matter of right and punishes those offence which any member hath commit against the society with such penalty a the law have establish whereby it be easy to discern who be and who be not in political society together those who be unite into one body and have common establish law and judicature to appeal to with authority to decide controversy between them and punish offender be in civil society one with another but those who have no such common appealmean on earth be still in the state of nature each be where there be no other judge for himself and executioner which be as have before shew it the perfect state of nature and thus the commonwealth come by power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several transgression which they think worthy of it commit amongst the member of that society which be the power of make law as well a it have the power to punish any injury do unto any of it member by any one that be not of it which be the power of war and peace and all this for the preservation of the property of all the member of that society as far a be possible but though every man who have enter into civil society and be become member of any commonwealth have thereby quit hi power to punish offence against the law of nature in prosecution of hi own private judgment yet with the judgment of offence which he have give up to the legislative in all case where he can appeal to the magistrate he have give right to the commonwealth to employ hi force for the execution of the judgment of the commonwealth whenever he shall be call to it which indeed be hi own judgment they be make by himself or hi representative and herein we have the original of the legislative and executive power of civil society which be to judge by stand law how far offence be to be punish when commit within the commonwealth and also to determine by occasional judgment found on the present circumstance of the fact how far injuries from without be to be vindicate and in both these to employ all the force of all the member when there shall be need whereever therefore any number of men be so united into one society a to quit every one hi executive power of the law of nature and to resign it to the public there and there only be political or civil society and this be do whereever any number of men in the state of nature enter into society to make one people one body politic under one supreme government or els when any one join himself to and incorporates with any government already make for hereby he authorize the society or which be all one the legislative thereof to make law for him a the public good of the society shall require to the execution whereof hi own assistance a to hi own decree be due and this put men out of state of nature into that ofcommonwealth by set upjudge on earth with authority to determine all the controversy and redress the injury that may happen to any member of the commonwealth which judge be the legislative or magistrate appoint by it and whereever there be any number of men however associate that have no such decisive power to appeal to there they be still in the state of nature hence it be evident that absolute monarchy which by some men be count the only government in the world be indeed inconsistent with civil society and so can be no form of civilgovernment at all for the end of civil society be to avoid and remedy those inconveniencies of the state of nature which necessarily follow from every man be judge in hi own case by set upknown authority to which every one of that society may appeal upon any injury receive or controversy that may arise and which every one of the society ought to obey whereever any person be who have not such an authority to appeal to for the decision of any difference between them there those person be still in the state of nature and so be every absolute prince in respect of those who be under hi dominion the public power of all society be above every soul contain in the same society and the principal use of that power be to give law unto all that be under it which law in such case we must obey unless there be reason shew which may necessarily inforce that the law of reason or of god doth enjoin the contrary hook eccl pol l i sect for he be suppose to have all both legislative and executive power in himself alone there be no judge to be find no appeal lie open to any one who may fairly and indifferently and with authority decide and from whose decision relief and redress may be expect of any injury or inconviency that may be suffer from the prince or by hi order so that such man however intitled czar or grand seignior or how you please be as much in the state of nature with all under hi dominion a he be with therest of mankind for whereever any two men be who have no standing rule and common judge to appeal to on earth for the determination of controversy of right betwixt them there they be still in the state of nature and under all the inconveniencies of it with only this woful difference to the subject or rather slave of an absolute prince that whereas in the ordinary state of nature he have liberty to judge of hi right and accord to the best of hi power to maintain it now whenever hi property be invade by the will and order of hi monarch he have not only no appeal a those in society ought to have but a if he be degrade from the common state of rational creature be deny liberty to judge of or to defend hi right and so be expose to all the misery and inconveniencies that man can fear from one who be in the unrestrained state of nature be yet corrupt with flattery and arm with power to take away all such mutual grievance injury and wrong ie such a attend men in the state of nature there be no way but only by grow into composition and agreement amongst themselves by ordain some kind of govemment public and by yield themselves subject thereunto that unto whom they grant authority to rule and govem by them the peace tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be procure men always know that where force and injury be offer they might be defender of themselves they know that however men may seek their own commodity yet if this be do with injury unto other it be not to be suffer but by all men and all good mean to be withstand finally they know that no man might in reason take upon him to determine hi own right and accord to hi own determination proceed in maintenance thereof in as much a every man be towards himself and them whom he greatly affect partial and therefore that strife and trouble would be endless except they give their common consent all to be order by some whom they should agree upon without which consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon him to be lord or judge over another hooker eccl pol for he that think absolute power purifies mens blood and correct the baseness of human nature need read but the history of this or any other age to be convince of the contrary he that would have be insolent and injurious in the wood of america would not probably be much well in throne where perhaps learn and religion shall be find out to justify all that he shall do to hi subject and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it for what the protection of absolute monarchy be what kind of father of their country it make prince to be and to what degree of happiness and security it carry civil society where this sort of government be grow to perfection he that will look into the late relation of ceylon may easily see in absolute monarchy indeed as well a other government of the world the subject have an appeal to the law and judge to decide any controversy and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the subject themselves one amongst another this every one think necessary and believe he deserve to be think declared enemy to society and mankind who should go about to take it away but whether this be fromtrue love of mankind and society and such charity a we owe all one to another there be reason to doubt for this be no more than what every man who love hi own power profit or greatness may and naturally must do keep those animal from hurt or destroy one another who labour and drudge only for hi pleasure and advantage and so be take care of not out of any love the master have for them but love of himself and the profit they bring him for if it be ask what security what fence be there in such state against the violence and oppression of this absolute ruler the very question can scarce be borne they be ready to tell you that it deserve death only to ask after safety betwixt subject and subject they will grant there must be measure law and judge for their mutual peace and security but a for the ruler he ought to be absolute and be above all such circumstance because he have power to do more hurt and wrong it be right when he do it to ask how you may be guard from harm or injury on that side where the strong hand be to do it be presently the voice of faction and rebellion a if when men quit the state of nature enter into society they agree that all of them but one should be under the restraint of law but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature increase with power and make licentious by impunity this be to think that men be so foolish that they take care to avoid what mischief may be do them by polecat or fox but be content nay think it safety to be devour by lion but whatever flatterer may talk to amuse people understanding it hinder not men from feeling and when they perceive that any man in what station soever be out of the bound of the civil society which they be of and that they have no appeal on earth against any harm they may receive from him they be apt to think themselves in the state of nature in respect of him whom they find to be so and to take care as soon a they can to have that safety and security in civil society for which it be first institute and for which only they enter into it and therefore though perhaps at first a shall be shew more at large hereafter in the following part of this discourse some one good and excellent man have gotpreeminency amongst the rest have this deference pay to hi goodness and virtue a to kind of natural authority that the chief rule with arbitration of their difference bytacit consent devolve into hi hand without any other caution but the assurance they have of hi uprightness and wisdom yet when time give authority and a some men would persuade u sacredness of custom which the negligent and unforeseeing innocence of the first age begin have bring in successor of another stamp the people find their property not secure under the government a then it be whereas government have no other end but the preservation of property could never be safe nor at rest nor think themselves in civil society till the legislature be place in collective body of men call them senate parliament or what you please by which mean every single person become subject equally with other the mean men to those law which he himself a part of the legislative have establish nor could any one by hi own authority avoid the force of the law when once make nor by any pretence of superiority plead exemption thereby to license hi own or the miscarriage of any of hi dependent no man in civil society can be exempt from the law of it for if any man may do what he think fit and there be no appeal on earth for redress or security against any harm he shall doask whether he be not perfectly still in the state of nature and so can be no part or member of that civil society unless any one will say the state of nature and civil society be one and the same thing whichhave never yet find any one so great patron of anarchy a to affirm at the first when some certain kind of regiment be once appoint it may be that nothing be then far think upon for the manner of goveming but all permit unto their wisdom and discretion which be to rule till by experience they find this for all part very inconvenient so a the thing which they have devise for remedy do indeed but increase the sore which it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all men misery this constrain them to come unto law wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalty of transgress them hooker eccl pol l i sect civil law be the act of the whole body politic doth therefore overrule each several part of the same body hooker ibid of the beginning of political society men be a have be say by nature all free equal and independent no one can be put out of this estate and subject to the political power of another without hi own consent the only way whereby any one divest himself of hi natural liberty and put on the bond of civil society be by agree with other men to join and unite intocommunity for their comfortable safe and peaceable live one amongst another insecure enjoyment of their property andgreater security against any that be not of it this any number of men may do because it injure not the freedom of the rest they be leave a they be in the liberty of the state of nature when any number of men have so consent to make one community or government they be thereby presently incorporate and make one body politic wherein the majority haveright to act and conclude the rest for when any number of men have by the consent of every individual make community they have thereby make that community one body with power to act a one body which be only by the will and determination of the majority for that which act any community be only the consent of the individual of it and it be necessary to that which be one body to move one way it be necessary the body should move that way whither the great force carry it which be the consent of the majority or els it be impossible it should act or continue one body one community which the consent of every individual that unite into it agree that it should and so every one be bind by that consent to be conclude by the majority and therefore we see that in assembly impowered to act by positive law where no number be set by that positive law which impowers them the act of the majority pass for the act of the whole and of course determines a have by the law of nature and reason the power of the whole and thus every man by consent with other to make one body politic under one government put himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority and to be conclude by it or els this original compact whereby he with other incorporates into one society would signify nothing and be no compact if he be leave free and under no other tie than he be in before in the state of nature for what appearance would there be of any compact what new engagement if he be no farther tie by any decree of the society than he himself think fit and do actually consent to this would be still as greatliberty a he himself have before hi compact or any one els in the state of nature hath who may submit himself and consent to any act of it if he think fit for if the consent of the majority shall not in reason be receive a the act of the whole and conclude every individual nothing but the consent of every individual can make any thing to be the act of the whole but such consent be next to impossible ever to be have if we consider the infirmity of health and avocation of business which innumber though much less than that ofcommonwealth will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly to which if we add the variety of opinion and contrariety of interest which unavoidably happen in all collection of men the come into society upon such term would be only like catos come into the theatre only to go out again suchconstitution a this would make the mighty leviathan ofshorter duration than the feeble creature and not let it outlast the day it be bear in which can not be suppose till we can think that rational creature should desire and constitute society only to be dissolve for where the majority can not conclude the rest there they can not act a one body and consequently will be immediately dissolve again whosoever therefore out of state of nature unite into community must be understood to give up all the power necessary to the end for which they unite into society to the majority of the community unless they expresly agree in any number great than the majority and this be do by barely agree to unite into one political society which be all the compact that be or need be between the individual that enter into or make upcommonwealth and thus that which begin and actually constitute any political society be nothing but the consent of any number of freeman capable ofmajority to unite and incorporate into suchsociety and this be that and that only which do or could give begin to any lawful government in the world to this find two objection make first that there be no instance to be find in story of company of men independent and equal one amongst another that meet together and in this way begin and set up government secondly it be impossible of right that men should do so because all men be bear under government they be to submit to that and be not at liberty to beginnew one to the first there be this to answer that it be not at all to be wonder that history give u but very little account of men that live together in the state of nature the inconvenience of that condition and the love and want of society no sooner bring any number of them together but they presently unite and incorporate if they design to continue together and if we may not suppose men ever to have be in the state of nature because we hear not much of them in suchstate we may as well suppose the army of salmanasser or xerxes be never child because we hear little of them till they be men and imbodied in armies government be every where antecedent to record and letter seldom come in amongstpeople tilllong continuation of civil society have by other more necessary art provide for their safety ease and plenty and then they begin to look after the history of their founder and search into their original when they have outlive the memory of it for it be with commonwealth a with particular person they be commonly ignorant of their own birth and infancy and if they know any thing of their original they be beholden for it to the accidental record that other have keep of it and those that we have of the beginning of any polity in the world except that of the jew where god himself immediately interpose and which favour not at all paternal dominion be all either plain instance of suchbeginning ashave mention or at least have manifest footstep of it he must shew strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact when it agree not with hi hypothesis who will not allow that shew strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact when it agree not with hi hypothesis who will not allow that the beginning of rome and venice be by the uniting together of several men free and independent one of another amongst whom there be no natural superiority or subjection and if josephus acostas word may be take he tell u that in many part of america there be no government at all there be great and apparent conjecture say he that these men speaking of those of peru for long time have neither king nor commonwealth but live in troop a they do this day in florida the cheriquanas those of brazil and many other nation which have no certain king but a occasion be offer in peace or war they choose their captain a they pleasei c if it be say that every man there be bear subject to hi father or the head of hi family that the subjection due from child to father take not away hi freedom of unite into what political society he think fit have be already prove but be that a it will these men it be evident be actually free and whatever superiority some politician now would place in any of them they themselves claim it not but by consent be all equal till by the same consent they set ruler over themselves so that their politic society all begin from voluntary union and the mutual agreement of men freely act in the choice of their governor and form of government and hope those who go away from sparta with palantus mention by justiniii cwill be allow to have be freemen independent one of another and to have set up government over themselves by their own consent thus have give several example out of history of people free and in the state of nature that be meet together incorporate and begin common wealth and if the want of such instance be an argument to prove that government be not nor could not be so begunsuppose the contender for paternal empire be good let it alone than urge it against natural liberty for if they can give so many instance out of history of government begin upon paternal rightthink though at best an argument from what have be to what should of right be have no great force one might without any great danger yield them the cause but ifmight advise them in the case they would do well not to search too much into the original of government a they have begin de facto l they should find at the foundation of most of them something very little favourable to the design they promote and suchpower a they contend for but to conclude reason be plain on our side that men be naturally free and the example of history shewing that the government of the world that be begin in peace have their beginning lay on that foundation and be make by the consent of the people there can be little room for doubt either where the right be or what have be the opinion or practice of mankind about the first erecting of government i will not deny that if we look back as far a history will direct u towards the original of commonwealth we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man andam also apt to believe that where family be numerous enough to subsist by itself and continue entire together without mix with other a it often happen where there be much land and few people the government commonly begin in the father for the father have by the law of nature the same power with every man els to punish a he think fit any offence against that law might thereby punish hi transgress child even when they be men and out of their pupilage and they be very likely to submit to hi punishment and all join with him against the offender in their turn give him thereby power to execute hi sentence against any transgression and so in effect make him the lawmaker and governor over all that remain in conjunction with hi family he be fit to be trust paternal affection secure their property and interest under hi care and the custom of obey him in their childhood make it easy to submit to him rather than to any other if therefore they must have one to rule them a government be hardly to be avoid amongst men that live together who so likely to be the man a he that be their common father unless negligence cruelty or any other defect of mind or body make him unfit for it but when either the father die and leave hi next heir for want of age wisdom courage or any other quality less fit for rule or where several family meet and consent to continue together there it be not to be doubt but they use their natural freedom to set up him whom they judge the able and most likely to rule well over them conformable hereunto we find the people of america who live out of the reach of the conquering sword and spread domination of the two great empire of peru and mexico enjoy their own natural freedom though caeteris paribus they commonly prefer the heir of their deceased king yet if they find him any way weak or uncapable they pass him by and set up the stoutest and brave man for their ruler thus though look back as far a record give u any account of people the world and the history of nation we commonly find the government to be in one hand yet it destroy not that which affirm viz that the beginning of politic society depend upon the consent of the individual to join into and make one society who when they be thus incorporated might set up what form of government they think fit but this have give occasion to men to mistake and think that by nature government be monarchical and belong to the father it may not be amiss here to consider why people in the beginning generally pitch upon this form which though perhaps the father preeminency might in the first institution of some commonwealth giverise to and place in the begin the power in one hand yet it be plain that the reason that continue the form of government insingle person be not any regard or respect to paternal authority since all petty monarchy that be almost all monarchy near their original have be commonly at least upon occasion elective first then in the beginning of thing the father government of the childhood of those sprung from him have accustom them to the rule of one man and teach them that where it be exercise with care and skill with affection and love to those under it it be sufficient to procure and preserve to men all the political happiness they seek for in society it be no wonder that they should pitch upon and naturally run into that form of government which from their infancy they have be all accustom to and which by experience they have find both easy and safe to which if we add that monarchy be simple and most obvious to men whom neither experience have instruct in form of government nor the ambition or insolence of empire have teach to beware of the encroachment of prerogative or the inconvenience of absolute power which monarchy in succession be apt to lay claim to and bring upon them it be not at all strange that they should not much trouble themselves to think of method of restrain any exorbitance of those to whom they have give the authority over them and of balance the power of government by place several part of it in different hand they have neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion nor do the fashion of the age nor their possession or way of living which afford little matter for covetousness or ambition give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it and therefore it be no wonder they put themselves into such frame of government a be not only assaid most obvious and simple but also best suit to their present state and condition which stand more in need of defence against foreign invasion and injury than of multiplicity of law the equality of simple poor way of live confine their desire within the narrow bound of each man small property make few controversy and so no need of many law to decide them or variety of officer to superintend the process or look after the execution of justice where there be but few trespass and few offender since then those who like one another so well a to join into society can not but be suppose to have some acquaintance and friendship together and some trust one in another they could not but have great apprehension of other than of one another and therefore their first care and think can not but be suppose to be how to secure themselves against foreign force it be natural for them to put themselves under frame of government which might best serve to that end and chuse the wise and bravest man to conduct them in their war and lead them out against their enemy and in this chiefly be their ruler thus we see that the king of the indian in america which be still pattern of the first age in asia and europe whilst the inhabitant be too few for the country and want of people and money give men no temptation to enlarge their possession of land or contest for wide extent of ground be little more than general of their army and though they command absolutely in war yet at home and in time of peace they exercise very little dominion and have but very moderate sovereignty the resolution of peace and war be ordinarily either in the people or incouncil tho the war itself which admit not of plurality of governor naturally devolve the command into the king sole authority and thus in israel itself the chief business of their judge and first king seem to have be to be captain in war and leader of their army which besides what be signify by go out and in before the people which be to march forth to war and home again in the head of their force appear plainly in the story of lephtha the ammonite make war upon israel the gileadites in fear send to lephthabastard of their family whom they have cast off and article with him if he will assist them against the ammonite to make him their ruler which they do in these word and the people make him head and captain over them judg xi ii which be a it seem all one a to be judge and he judge israel judg xiithat be be their captaingeneral six year so when lotham upbraid the shechemites with the obligation they have to gideon who have be their judge and ruler he tell them he fight for you and adventure hi life far and deliver you out of the hand of midian judg ixnothing mention of him but what he do a general and indeed that be all be find in hi history or in any of the rest of the judge and abimelech particularly be call king though at most he be but their general and when be weary of the ill conduct of samuel sons the child of israel desiredking like all the nation to judge them and to go out before them and to fight their battle i sam viiigod grant their desire say to samuelwill send theeman and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistine ixas if the only business of king have be to lead out their army and fight in their defence and accordingly at hi inauguration pour vial of oil upon him declare to saul that the lord have anoint him to be captain over hi inheritance xand therefore those who after saul be solemnly choose and salute king by the tribe at mispah be unwilling to have him their king make no other objection but this how shall this man save u vas if they should have say this man be unfit to be our king not have skill and conduct enough in war to be able to defend u and when god resolve to transfer the government to david it be in these word but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath seek him man after hi own heart and the lord hath command him to be captain over hi people xiiias if the whole kingly authority be nothing els but to be their general and therefore the tribe who have stick to saul family and opposed david reign when they come to hebron with term of submission to him they tell him amongst other argument they have to submit to him a to their king that he be in effect their king in saul time and therefore they have no reason but to receive him a their king now also say they in time past when saul be king over u thou wast he that reddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord say unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt becaptain over israel thus whether family by degree grow up into commonwealth and the fatherly authority be continue on to the elder son every one in hi turn grow up under it tacitly submit to it and the easiness and equality of it not offend any one every one acquiesce till time seem to have confirm it and settle right of succession by prescription or whether several family or the descendant of several family whom chance neighbourhood or business bring together unite into society the need ofgeneral whose conduct might defend them against their enemy in war and the great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age such a be almost all those which begin government that ever come to last in the world give men one of another make the first beginner of commonwealth generally put the rule into one man hand without any other express limitation or restraint but what the nature of the thing and the end of government require which ever of those it be that at first put the rule into the hand of single person certain it be no body be intrust with it but for the public good and safety and to those end in the infancy of commonwealth those who have it commonly use it and unless they have do so young society could not have subsist without such nursing father tender and careful of the public weal all government would have sink under the weakness and infirmity of their infancy and the prince and the people have soon perish together but though the golden age before vain ambition and amor sceleratus habendi evil concupiscence have corrupt men mind into mistake of true power and honour have more virtue and consequently good governor as well a less vicious subject and there be then no stretch prerogative on the one side to oppress the people nor consequently on the other any dispute about privilege to lessen or restrain the power of the magistrate and so no contest betwixt ruler and people about governor or government yet when ambition and luxury in future age would retain and increase the power without do the business for which it be give and aid by flattery taught prince to have distinct and separate interest from their people men find it necessary to examine more carefully the original and right of government and to find out way to restrain the exorbitance and prevent the abuse of that power which they have intrust in anothers hand only for their own good they find be make use of to hurt them at first when some certain kind of regiment be once approve it may be nothing be then far think upon for the manner of govern but all permit unto their wisdom and discretion which be to rule till by experience they find this for all part very inconvenient so a the thing which they have devise for remedy do indeed but increase the sore which it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all men misery this constrain them to come unto law wherein all men might see their duty before hand and know the penalty of transgress them hooker eccl pol l i sect thus we may see how probable it be that people that be naturally free and by their own consent either submit to the government of their father or unite together out of different family to make government should generally put the rule into one man hand and chuse to be under the conduct of single person without so much a by express condition limit or regulate hi power which they think safe enough in hi honesty and prudence though they never dream of monarchy be lure divino which we never hear of among mankind till it be reveal to u by the divinity of this last age nor ever allow paternal power to have right to dominion or to be the foundation of all government and thus much may suffice to shew that as far a we have any light from history we have reason to conclude that all peaceful beginning of government have be lay in the consent of the peoplesay peaceful because shall have occasion in another place to speak of conquest which some esteem way of beginning of government the other objection find urge against the beginning of polity in the way have mention be this viz that all men be bear under government some or other it be impossible any of them should ever be free and at liberty to unite together and beginnew one or ever be able to erect lawful government if this argument be goodask how come so many lawful monarchy into the world for if any body upon this supposition can shew me any one man in any age of the world free to begin lawful monarchywill be bind to shew him ten other free men at liberty at the same time to unite and beginnew government under regal or any other form it be demonstration that if any one bear under the dominion of another may be so free a to have right to command other innew and distinct empire every one that be bear under the dominion of another may be so free too and may become ruler or subject of distinct separate government and so by this their own principle either all men however bear be free or els there be but one lawful prince one lawful government in the world and then they have nothing to do but barely to shew u which that be which when they have donedoubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him though it be sufficient answer to their objection to shew that it involve them in the same difficulty that it doth those they use it against yet shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument little farther all men say they be bear under government and therefore they can not be at liberty to beginnew one every one be bear subject to hi father or hi prince and be therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it be plain mankind never own nor consider any such natural subjection that they be bear in to one or to the other that tie them without their own consent to subjection to them and their heir for there be no example so frequent in history both sacred and profane a those of men withdraw themselves and their obedience from the jurisdiction they be bear under and the family or community they be breed up in and set up new government in other place from whence sprang all that number of petty commonwealth in the beginning of age and which always multiply as long a there be room enough till the strong or more fortunate swallow the weaker and those great one again break to piece dissolve into less dominion all which be so many testimony against paternal sovereignty and plainly prove that it be not the natural right of the father descend to hi heir that make government in the beginning since it be impossible upon that ground there should have be so many little kingdom all must have be but only one universal monarchy if men have not be at liberty to separate themselves from their family and the government be it what it will that be set up in it and go and make distinct commonwealth and other government a they think fit this have be the practice of the world from it first beginning to this day nor be it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind that they be bear under constitute and ancient polity that have establish law and set form of government than if they be bear in the wood amongst the unconfined inhabitant that run loose in them for those who would persuade u that by be bear under any government we be naturally subject to it and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bat that of paternal power which we have already answer to produce for it but only because our father or progenitor pass away their natural liberty and thereby bind up themselves and their posterity toperpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submit to it be true that whatever engagement or promise any one have make for himself he be under the obligation of them but can not by any compact whatsoever bind hi child or posterity for hi son whenman be altogether as free a the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of any body els he may indeed annex such condition to the land he enjoy a subject of any commonwealth a may oblige hi son to be of that community if he will enjoy those possession which be hi father because that estate be hi father property he may dispose or settle it a he please and this have generally give the occasion to mistake in this matter because commonwealth not permit any part of their dominion to be dismember nor to be enjoy by any but those of their community the son can not ordinarily enjoy the possession of hi father but under the same term hi father do by become member of the society whereby he put himself presently under the government he find there establish as much a any other subject of that commonwealth and thus the consent of freeman bear under government which only make them member of it be give separately in their turn a each come to be of age and not in multitude together people take no notice of it and think it not do at all or not necessary conclude they be naturally subject a they be men but it be plain government themselves understand it otherwise they claim no power over the son because of that they have over the father nor look on child a be their subject by their father be so if subject of england have child by an english woman in france whose subject be he not the king of england for he must have leave to be admit to the privilege of it nor the king of france for how then have hi fatherliberty to bring him away and breed him a he please and who ever be judge astraytor or deserter if he leave or war against country for be barely bear in it of parent that be alien there it be plain then by the practice of government themselves as well a by the law of right reason thatchild be bornsubject of no country or government he be under hi father tuition and authority till he come to age of discretion and then he be freeman at liberty what government he will put himself under what body politic he will unite himself to for if an englishman son bear in france be at liberty and may do so it be evident there be no tie upon him by hi father be subject of this kingdom nor be he bind up by any compact of hi ancestor and why then hath not hi son by the same reason the same liberty though he be bear any where els since the power that father hath naturally over hi child be the same whereever they be bear and the tie of natural obligation be not bound by the positive limit of kingdom and commonwealth every man be a have be shew naturally free and nothing be able to put him into subjection to any earthly power but only hi own consent it be to be consider what shall be understand to be sufficient declaration ofmans consent to make him subject to the law of any government there be common distinction of an express andtacit consent which will concern our present case no body doubt but an express consent of any man enter into any society make himperfect member of that societysubject of that government the difficulty be what ought to be look upon a tacit consent and how far it bind ie how far any one shall be look on to have consent and thereby submit to any government where he have make no expression of it at all and to thissay that every man that hath any possession or enjoyment of any part of the dominion of any government doth thereby give hi tacit consent and be as far forth oblige to obedience to the law of that government during such enjoyment a any one under it whether this hi possession be of land to him and hi heir for ever orlodging only for week or whether it be barely travel freely on the highway and in effect it reach as far a the very be of any one within the territory of that government to understand this the good it be fit to consider that every man when he at first incorporate himself into any commonwealth he by hi unite himself thereunto annex also and submit to the community those possession which he have or shall acquire that do not already belong to any other government for it would bedirect contradiction for any one to enter into society with other for the securing and regulating of property and yet to suppose hi land whose property be to be regulate by the law of the society should be exempt from the jurisdiction of that government to which he himself the proprietor of the land be subject by the same act therefore whereby any one unite hi person which be before free to any commonwealth by the same he unite hi possession which be before free to it also and they become both of them person and possession subject to the government and dominion of that commonwealth as long a it hath be whoever therefore from thenceforth by inheritance purchase permission or otherways enjoy any part of the land so annexed to and under the government of that commonwealth must take it with the condition it be under that be of submit to the government of the commonwealth under whose jurisdiction it be a far forth a any subject of it but since the government hasdirect jurisdiction only over the land and reach the possessor of it before he have actually incorporate himself in the society only a he dwell upon and enjoy that the obligation any one be under by virtue of such enjoyment to submit to the government begin and end with the enjoyment so that whenever the owner who have give nothing but suchtacit consent to the government will by donation sale or otherwise quit the say possession he be at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other commonwealth or to agree with other to beginnew one in vacuis loci in any part of the world they can find free and unpossessed whereas he that have once by actual agreement and any express declaration give hi consent to be of any commonwealth be perpetually and indispensably oblige to be and remain unalterablysubject to it and can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature unless by any calamity the government he be under come to be dissolve or els by some public act cut him off from be any longermember of it but submit to the law of any country live quietly and enjoy privilege and protection under them make notmanmember of that society this be onlylocal protection and homage due to and from all those who not be instate of war come within the territory belong to any government to all part whereof the force of it law extend but this no more makesmanmember of that societyperpetual subject of that commonwealth than it would makemansubject to another in whose family he find it convenient to abide for some time though whilst he continue in it he be oblige to comply with the law and submit to the government he find there and thus we see that foreigner by live all their life under another government and enjoy the privilege and protection of it though they be bind even in conscience to submit to it administration a far forth a any denison yet do not thereby come to be subject or member of that commonwealth nothing can make any man so but hi actually enter into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact this be that whichthink concern the beginning of political society and that consent which make any onemember of any commonwealth of the end of political society and government if man in the state of nature be so free a have be say if he be absolute lord of hi own person and possession equal to the great and subject to no body why will he part with hi freedom why will he give up this empire and subject himself to the dominion and controul of any other power to which it be obvious to answer that though in the state of nature he hath suchright yet the enjoyment of it be very uncertain and constantly expose to the invasion of other for all be king as much a he every man hi equal and the great part no strict observer of equity and justice the enjoyment of the property he have in this state be very unsafe very unsecure this make him willing to quitcondition which however free be full of fear and continual danger and it be not without reason that he seek out and be willing to join in society with other who be already united or havemind to unite for the mutual preservation of their life liberty and estate whichcall by the general name property the great and chief end therefore of men unite into commonwealth and put themselves under government be the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there be many thing want first there want an establish settle known law receive and allow by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measure to decide all controversy between them for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creature yet men be bias by their interest as well a ignorant for want of study of it be not apt to allow of it aslaw bind to them in the application of it to their particular case secondly in the state of nature there want know and indifferent judge with authority to determine all difference accord to the establish law for every one in that state be both judge and executioner of the law of nature men be partial to themselves passion and revenge be very apt to carry them too far and with too much heat in their own case as well a negligence and unconcerned to make them too remiss in other men thirdly in the state of nature there often want power to back and support the sentence when right and to give it due execution they who by any injustice offend will seldom fail where they be able by force to make good their injustice such resistance many time make the punishment dangerous and frequently destructive to those who attempt it thus mankind notwithstanding all the privilege of the state of nature be but in an ill condition while they remain in it be quickly drive into society hence it come to pass that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state the inconveniencies that they be therein expose to by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man have of punish the transgression of other make them take sanctuary under the establish law of government and therein seek the preservation of their property it be this make them so willingly give up every one hi single power of punish to be exercise by such alone a shall be appoint to it amongst them and by such rule a the community or those authorize by them to that purpose shall agree on and in this we have the original right and rise of both the legislative and executive power as well a of the government and society themselves for in the state of nature to omit the liberty he have of innocent delightsman have two power the first be to do whatsoever he think fit for the preservation of himself and other within the permission of the law of nature by which law common to them all he and all the rest of mankind be one community make up one society distinct from all other creature and be it not for the corruption and vitiousness of degenerate men there would be no need of any other no necessity that men should separate from this great and natural community and by positive agreement combine into small and divide association the other powerman have in the state of nature be the power to punish the crime commit against that law both these he give up when he join inprivate ifmay so call it or particular politic society and incorporate into any commonwealth separate from the rest of mankind the first power viz of do whatsoever he think for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind he give up to be regulate by law make by the society so far forth a the preservation of himself and the rest of that society shall require which law of the society in many thing confine the liberty he have by the law of nature secondly the power of punish he wholly give up and engage hi natural force which he might before employ in the execution of the law of nature by hi own single authority a he think fit to assist the executive power of the society a the law thereof shall require for be now innew state wherein he be to enjoy many conveniencies from the labour assistance and society of other in the same community as well a protection from it whole strength he be to part also with as much of hi natural liberty in provide for himself a the good prosperity and safety of the society shall require which be not only necessary but just since the other member of the society do the like but though men when they enter into society give up the equality liberty and executive power they have in the state of nature into the hand of the society to be so far dispose of by the legislative a the good of the society shall require yet it be only with an intention in every one the good to preserve himself hi liberty and property for no rational creature can be suppose to change hi condition with an intention to be bad the power of the society or legislative constitute by them can never be suppose to extend farther than the common good but be oblige to secure every one property by provide against those three defect above mention that make the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy and so whoever have the legislative or supreme power of any commonwealth be bind to govern by establish stand law promulgate and know to the people and not by extemporary decree by indifferent and upright judge who be to decide controversy by those law and to employ the force of the community at home only in the execution of such law or abroad to prevent or redress foreign injury and secure the community from inroad and invasion and all this to be direct to no other end but the peace safety and public good of the people of the form ofcommonwealth the majority have a have be shew upon men first unite into society the whole power of the community naturally in them may employ all that power in make law for the community from time to time and execute those law by officer of their own appointing and then the form of the government be perfect democracy or els may put the power of make law into the hand offew select men and their heir or successor and then it be an oligarchy or els into the hand of one man and then it be monarchy if to him and hi heir it be an hereditary monarchy if to him only for life but upon hi death the power only of nominate successor to return to them an elective monarchy and so accordingly of these the community may make compounded and mixed form of government a they think good and if the legislative power be at first give by the majority to one or more person only for their life or any limited time and then the supreme power to revert to them again when it be so reverted the community may dispose of it again anew into what hand they please and so constitutenew form of government for the form of government depend upon the place the supreme power which be the legislative it be impossible to conceive that an inferior power should prescribe tosuperior or any but the supreme make law accord a the power of make law be place such be the form of the commonwealth by commonwealthmust be understand all along to mean not democracy or any form of government but any independent community which the latin signify by the word civitas to which the word which best answer in our language be commonwealth and most properly express such society of men which community or city in english do not for there may be subordinate community in government and city amongst u hasquite different notion from commonwealth and therefore to avoid ambiguitycrave leave to use the word commonwealth in that sense in which find it use by king james the first andtake it to be it genuine signification which if any body dislikeconsent with him to change it for good of the extent of the legislative power the great end of men enter into society be the enjoyment of their property in peace and safety and the great instrument and mean of that be the law establish in that society the first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealth be the establishing of the legislative power a the first and fundamental natural law which be to govern even the legislative itself be the preservation of the society and as far a will consist with the public good of every person in it this legislative be not only the supreme power of the commonwealth but sacred and unalterable in the hand where the community have once place it nor can any edict of any body els in what form soever conceive or by what power soever back have the force and obligation oflaw which have not it sanction from that legislative which the public have choose and appoint for without this the law could not have that which be absolutely necessary to it beinglaw the consent of the society over whom no body can havepower to make law but by their own consent and by authority receive from them and therefore all the obedience which by the most solemn tie any one can be oblige to pay ultimately terminate in this supreme power and be direct by those law which it enact nor can any oath to any foreign power whatsoever or any domestic subordinate power discharge any member of the society from hi obedience to the legislative acting pursuant to their trust nor oblige him to any obedience contrary to the law so enact or farther than they do allow it be ridiculous to imagine one can be tie ultimately to obey any power in the society which be not the supreme the lawful power of make law to command whole politic society of men belong so properly unto the same intire society that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself and not by express commission immediately and personally receive from god or els by authority derive at the first from their consent upon whose person they impose law it be no good than mere tyranny law they be not therefore which public approbation hath not make so hooker eccl pol l i sect of this point therefore we be to note that such men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole politic multitude of men therefore utterly without our consent we could in such sort be at no man commandment living and to be command we do consent when that society whereof we be part hath at any time before consent without revoke the same after by the like universal agreement law therefore human of what kind so ever be available by consent ibid though the legislative whether place in one or more whether it be always in be or only by interval though it be the supreme power in every commonwealth yet first it be not nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the life and fortune of the people for it be but the joint power of every member of the society give up to that person or assembly which be legislator it can be no more than those person have instate of nature before they enter into society and give up to the community for no body can transfer to another more power than he have in himself and no body have an absolute arbitrary power over himself or over any other to destroy hi own life or take away the life or property of anotherman a have be prove can not subject himself to the arbitrary power of another and have in the state of nature no arbitrary power over the life liberty or possession of another but only so much a the law of nature give him for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind this be all he doth or can give up to the commonwealth and by it to the legislative power so that the legislative can have no more than this their power in the utmost bound of it be limit to the public good of the society it ispower that hath no other end but preservation and therefore can never have right to destroy enslave or designedly to impoverish the subject the obligation of the law of nature cease not in society but only in many case be draw closer and have by human law know penalty annex to them to inforce their observation thus the law of nature stand a an eternal rule to all men legislator as well a other the rule that they make for other mens action must as well a their own and other men action be conformable to the law of nature ie to the will of god of which that isdeclaration and the fundamental law of nature be the preservation of mankind no human sanction can be good or valid against it two foundation there be which bear up public societies the one natural inclination whereby all men desire sociable life and fellowship the other an order expresly or secretly agree upon touch the manner of their union in live together the latter be that which we call the law of commonweal the very soul of politic body the part whereof be by law animate hold together and set on work in such action a the common good requireth law politic ordain for external order and regiment amongst men be never frame a they should be unless presume the will of man to be inwardly obstinate rebellious and averse from all obedience to the sacred law of hi nature in word unless presume man to be in regard of hi depraved mind little good than wild beast they do accordingly provide notwithstanding so to frame hi outward action that they be no hindrance unto the common good for which society be institute unless they do this they be not perfect hooker eccl pol l i sect secondly the legislative or supreme authority can not assume to it self power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decree but be bind to dispense justice and decide the right of the subject by promulgated stand law and know authorized judge for the law of nature be unwritten and so no where to be find but in the mind of men they who through passion or interest shall miscite or misapply it can not so easily be convince of their mistake where there be no establish judge and so it serve not a it ought to determine the right and fence the property of those that live under it especially where every one be judge interpreter and executioner of it too and that in hi own case and he that have right on hi side have ordinarily but hi own single strength hath not force enough to defend himself from injury or to punish delinquent to avoid these inconvenience which disorder men propperties in the state of nature men unite into society that they may have the united strength of the whole society to secure and defend their property and may have stand rule to bind it by which every one may know what be hi to this end it be that men give up all their natural power to the society which they enter into and the community put the legislative power into such hand a they think fit with this trust that they shall be govern by declared law or els their peace quiet and property will still be at the same uncertainty a it be in the state of nature human law be measure in respect of men whose action they must direct howbeit such measure they be as have also their high rule to be measure by which rule be two the law of god and the law of nature so that law human must be make accord to the general law of nature and without contradiction to any positive law of scripture otherwise they be ill make hooker eccl pol l iii sect to constrain men to any thing inconvenient doth seem unreasonable ibid l i sect absolute arbitrary power or govern without settle stand law can neither of them consist with the end of society and government which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for and tie themselves up under be it not to preserve their life liberty and fortune and by stated rule of right and property to secure their peace and quiet it can not be suppose that they should intend have they power so to do to give to any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their person and estate and put force into the magistrate hand to execute hi unlimited will arbitrarily upon them this be to put themselves into bad condition than the state of nature wherein they have liberty to defend their right against the injury of other and be upon equal term of force to maintain it whether invade by single man or many in combination whereas by suppose they have give up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of legislator they have disarm themselves and arm him to make prey of them when he please he be in much bad condition who be expose to the arbitrary power of one man who have the command of than he that be expose to the arbitrary power of single men no body be secure that hi will who have suchcommand be well than that of other men though hi force betimes strong and therefore whatever form the commonwealth be under the rule power ought to govern by declared and receive law and not by extemporary dictate and undetermined resolution for then mankind will be infar bad condition than in the state of nature if they shall have arm one or few men with the joint power of multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decree of their sudden thought or unrestrained and till that moment unknown will without have any measure set down which may guide and justify their action for all the power the government have be only for the good of the society a it ought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure so it ought to be exercise by establish and promulgate law that both the people may know their duty and be safe and secure within the limit of the law and the ruler too keep within their bound and not be tempt by the power they have in their hand to employ it to such purpose and by such measure a they would not have know and own not willingly thirdly the supreme power can not take from any man any part of hi property without hi own consent for the preservation of property be the end of government and that for which men enter into society it necessarily suppose and require that the people should have property without which they must be suppose to lose that by enter into society which be the end for which they enter into it too gross an absurdity for any man to own men therefore in society have property they have suchright to the good which by the law of the community be theirs that no body hathright to take their substance or any part of it from them without their own consent without this they have no property at all for have truly no property in that which another can by right take from me when he please against my consent hence it be mistake to think that the supreme or legislative power of any commonwealth can do what it will and dispose of the estate of the subject arbitrarily or take any part of them at pleasure this be not much to be fear in government where the legislative consist wholly or in part in assembly which be variable whose member upon the dissolution of the assembly be subject under the common law of their country equally with the rest but in government where the legislative be in one lasting assembly always in be or in one man a in absolute monarchy there be danger still that they will think themselves to have distinct interest from the rest of the community and so will be apt to increase their own rich and power by take what they think fit from the people formans property be not at all secure tho there be good and equitable law to set the bound of it between him and hi fellow subject if he who command those subject have power to take from any private man what part he please of hi property and use and dispose of it a he think good but government into whatsoever hand it be put be as have before shew in trust with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their property the prince or senate however it may have power to make law for the regulating of property between the subject one amongst another yet can never have power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subject property without their own consent for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all and to let u see that even absolute power where it be necessary be not arbitrary by be absolute but be still limit by that reason and confine to those end which require it in some case to be absolute we need look no farther than the common practice of martial discipline for the preservation of the army and in it of the whole commonwealth require an absolute obedience to the command of every superior officer and it be justly death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them but yet we see that neither the serjeant that could command soldier to march up to the mouth ofcannon or stand inbreach where he be almost sure to perish can command that soldier to give him one penny of hi money nor the general that can condemn him to death for desert hi post or for not obey the most desperate order can yet with all hi absolute power of life and death dispose of one farthing of that soldier estate or seize one jot of hi good whom yet he can command any thing and hang for the least disobedience because such blind obedience be necessary to that end for which the commander have hi power viz the preservation of the rest but the disposing of hi good have nothing to do with it it be true government can not be support without great charge and it be fit every one who enjoy hi share of the protection should pay out of hi estate hi proportion for the maintenance of it but still it must be with hi own consent ie the consent of the majority give it either by themselves or their representative choose by them for if any one shall claim power to lay and levy tax on the people by hi own authority and without such consent of the people he thereby invade the fundamental law of property and subvert the end of government for what property havein that which another may by right take when he please to himself fourthly the legislative can not transfer the power of make law to any other hand for it be but delegated power from the people they who have it can not pass it over to other the people alone can appoint the form of the commonwealth which be by constitute the legislative and appoint in whose hand that shall be and when the people have say we will submit to rule and be govern by law make by such men and in such form no body els can say other men shall make law for them nor can the people be bind by any law but such a be enact by those whom they have choose and authorize to make law for them the power of the legislative be derive from the people bypositive voluntary grant and institution can be no other than what that positive grant convey which be only to make law and not to make legislator the legislative can have no power to transfer their authority of make law and place it in other hand these be the bound which the trust that be put in them by the society and the law of god and nature have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth in all form of government first they be to govern by promulgated establish law not to be vary in particular case but to have one rule for rich and poor for the favourite at court and the country man at plough secondly these law also ought to be design for no other end ultimately but the good of the people thirdly they must not raise tax on the property of the people without the consent of the people give by themselves or their deputy and this properly concern only such government where the legislative be always in be or at least where the people have not reserve any part of the legislative to deputy to be from time to time choose by themselves fourthly the legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of make law to any body els or place it any where but where the people have of the legislative executive and federative power of the commonwealth the legislative power be that which have right to direct how the force of the commonwealth shall be employ for preserve the community and the member of it but because those law which be constantly to be execute and whose force be always to continue may be make in little time therefore there be no need that the legislative should be always in be not have always business to do and because it may be too great temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power for the same person who have the power of make law to have also in their hand the power to execute them whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the law they make and suit the law both in it making and execution to their own private advantage and thereby come to have distinct interest from the rest of the community contrary to the end of society and government therefore in wellordered commonwealth where the good of the whole be so consider a it ought the legislative power be put into the hand of diver person who duly assemble have by themselves or jointly with otherspower to make law which when they have do be separate again they be themselves subject to the law they have make which isnew and near tie upon them to take care that they make them for the public good but because the law that be at once and in short time make have constant and lasting force and need perpetual execution or an attendance thereunto therefore it be necessary there should be power always in be which should see to the execution of the law that be make and remain in force and thus the legislative and executive power come often to be separate there be another power in every commonwealth which one may call natural because it be that which answer to the power every man naturally have before he enter into society for though incommon wealth the member of it be distinct person still in reference to one another and as such a govern by the law of the society yet in reference to the rest of mankind they make one body which be a every member of it before be still in the state of nature with the rest of mankind hence it be that the controversy that happen between any man of the society with those that be out of it be manage by the public and an injury do tomember of their body engage the whole in the reparation of it so that under this consideration the whole community be one body in the state of nature in respect of all other state or person out of it community this therefore contain the power of war and peace league and alliance and all the transaction with all person and community without the commonwealth and may be call federative if any one plea so the thing be understoodam indifferent a to the name these two power executive and federative though they be really distinct in themselves yet one comprehend the execution of the municipal law of the society within it self upon all that be part of it the other the management of the security and interest of the public without with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from yet they be always almost united and though this federative power in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the commonwealth yet it be much less capable to be direct by antecedent stand positive law than the executive and so must necessarily be leave to the prudence and wisdom of those whose hand it be in to be manage for the public good for the law that concern subject one amongst another be to direct their action may well enough precede them but what be to be do in reference to foreigner depend much upon their action and the variation of design and interest must be leave in great part to the prudence of those who have this power commit to them to be manage by the best of their skill for the advantage of the commonwealth though a say the executive and federative power of every community be really distinct in themselves yet they be hardly to be separate and place at the same time in the hand of distinct person for both of them require the force of the society for their exercise it be almost impracticable to place the force of the commonwealth in distinct and not subordinate hand or that the executive and federative power should be place in person that might act separately whereby the force of the public would be under different command which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and ruin of the subordination of the power of the commonwealth though inconstituted commonwealth stand upon it own basis and act accord to it own nature that be act for the preservation of the community there can be but one supreme power which be the legislative to which all the rest be and must be subordinate yet the legislative be only fiduciary power to act for certain end there remain still in the people supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust repose in them for all power give with trust for the attain an end be limit by that end whenever that end be manifestly neglect or oppose the trust must necessarily be forfeit and the power devolve into the hand of those that give it who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security and thus the community perpetually retain supreme power of save themselves from the attempt and design of any body even of their legislator whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked a to lay and carry on design against the liberty and property of the subject for no man or society of men havingpower to deliver up their preservation or consequently the mean of it to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another when ever any one shall go about to bring them into such slavish condition they will always have right to preserve what they have not power to part with and to rid themselves of those who invade this fundamental sacred and unalterable law of selfpreservation for which they enter into society and thus the community may be say in this respect to be always the supreme power but not a consider under any form of government because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolve in all case whilst the government subsist the legislative be the supreme power for what can give law to another must needs be superior to him and since the legislative be no otherwise legislative of the society but by the right it have to make law for all the part and for every member of the society prescribing rule to their action and give power of execution where they be transgress the legislative must needs be the supreme and all other power in any member or part of the society derive from and subordinate to it in some commonwealth where the legislative be not always in be and the executive be vested insingle person who have also share in the legislative there that single person in very tolerable sense may also be call supreme not that he have in himself all the supreme power which be that of lawmaking but because he have in him the supreme execution from whom all inferior magistrate derive all their several subordinate power or at least the great part of them have also no legislative superior to him there be no law to be make without hi consent which can not be expect should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative he be properly enough in this sense supreme but yet it be to be observe that tho oath of allegiance and fealty be take to him it be not to him a supreme legislator but a supreme executor of the law make byjoint power of him with other allegiance be nothing but an obedience accord to law which when he violate he have no right to obedience nor can claim it otherwise than a the public person vest with the power of the law and so be to be consider a the image phantom or representative of the commonwealth act by the will of the society declare in it law and thus he have no will no power but that of the law but when he quit this representation this public will and act by hi own private will he degrade himself and be but single private person without power and without will that have any right to obedience the member owe no obedience but to the public will of the society the executive power place any where but in person that have also share in the legislative be visibly subordinate and accountable to it and may be at pleasure change and displace so that it be not the supreme executive power that be exempt from subordination but the supreme executive power vest in one who have share in the legislative have no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and accountable to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he be no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit which one may certainly conclude will be but very little of other ministerial and subordinate power incommon wealth we need not speak they be so multiply with infinite variety in the different custom and constitution of distinct commonwealth that it be impossible to give particular account of them all only thus much which be necessary to our present purpose we may take notice of concern them that they have no manner of authority any of them beyond what be by positive grant and commission delegate to them and be all of them accountable to some other power in the commonwealth it be not necessary no nor so much a convenient that the legislative should be always in be but absolutely necessary that the executive power should because there be not always need of new law to be make but always need of execution of the law that be make when the legislative hath put the execution of the law they make into other hand they have power still to resume it out of those hand when they find cause and to punish for any maladministration against the law the same hold also in regard of the federative power that and the executive be both ministerial and subordinate to the legislative which a have be shew inconstituted commonwealth be the supreme the legislative also in this case be suppose to consist of several person for if it be single person it can not but be always in be and so will a supreme naturally have the supreme executive power together with the legislative may assemble and exercise their legislature at the time that either their original constitution or their own adjournment appoints or when they please if neither of these hath appoint any time or there be no other way prescribe to convoke them for the supreme power be place in them by the people it be always in them and they may exercise it when they please unless by their original constitution they be limit to certain season or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourn to certain time and when that time come they have right to assemble and act again if the legislative or any part of it be make up of representative choose for that time by the people which afterwards return into the ordinary state of subject and have no share in the legislature but upon new choice this power of chusing must also be exercise by the people either at certain appointed season or els when they be summon to it and in this latter case the power of convoke the legislative be ordinarily place in the executive and have one of these two limitation in respect of time that either the original constitution require their assembling and act at certain interval and then the executive power do nothing but ministerially issue direction for their electing and assemble accord to due form or els it be leave to hi prudence to call them by new election when the occasion or exigency of the public require the amendment of old or make of new law or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lie on or threaten the people it may be demand here what if the executive power be possess of the force of the commonwealth shall make use of that force to hinder the meeting and acting of the legislative when the original constitution or the public exigency require itsay use force upon the people without authority and contrary to the trust put in him that do so be state of war with the people who have right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power for have erect legislative with an intent they should exercise the power of make law either at certain set time or when there be need of it when they be hinder by any force from what be so necessary to the society and wherein the safety and preservation of the people consist the people have right to remove it by force in all state and condition the true remedy of force without authority be to oppose force to it the use of force without authority always put him that use it into state of war a the aggressor and render him liable to be treat accordingly the power of assemble and dismiss the legislative place in the executive give not the executive superiority over it but be fiduciary trust place in him for the safety of the people in case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affair could not bear steady fix rule for it not be possible that the first framer of the government should by any foresight be so much master of future event a to be able to prefix so just period of return and duration to the assembly of the legislative in all time to come that might exactly answer all the exigency of the commonwealth the best remedy could be find for this defect be to trust this to the prudence of one who be always to be present and whose business it be to watch over the public good constant frequent meeting of the legislative and long continuation of their assembly without necessary occasion could not but be burdensome to the people and must necessarily in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies and yet the quick turn of affair might be sometimes such a to need their present help any delay of their convening might endanger the public and sometimes too their business might be so great that the limited time of their sitting might be too short for their work and rob the public of that benefit which could be have only from their mature deliberation what then could be do in this case to prevent the community from be expose some time or other to eminent hazard on one side or the other by fixed interval and period set to the meeting and acting of the legislative but to in trust it to the prudence of some who be present and acquaint with the state of public affair might make use of this prerogative for the public good and where els could this be so well place a in hi hand who be intrust with the execution of the law for the same end thus suppose the regulation of time for the assembling and sitting of the legislative not settle by the original constitution it naturally fell into the hand of the executive not a an arbitrary power depend on hi good pleasure but with this trust always to have it exercise only for the public weal a the occurrence of time and change of affair might require whether settle period of their convening orliberty leave to the prince for convoke the legislative or perhapsmixture of both hath the least inconvenience attend it it be not my business here to inquire but only to shew that though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoke and dissolve such convention of the legislative yet it be not thereby superior to it thing of this world be in so constant flux that nothing remain long in the same state thus people rich trade power change their station flourish mighty city come to ruin and prove in time neglected desolate corner whilst other unfrequented place grow into populous country fill with wealth and inhabitant but thing not always change equally and private interest often keep up custom and privilege when the reason of them be cease it often come to pass that in government where part of the legislative consists of representative choose by the people that in tract of time this representation become very unequal and disproportionate to the reason it be at first establish upon to what gross absurdities the following of custom when reason have leave it may lead we may be satisfy when we see the bare name of town of which there remain not so much a the ruin where scarce so much housing a sheep cote or more inhabitant than shepherd be to be find sends a many representative to the grand assembly of lawmaker a whole county numerous in people and powerful in rich this stranger stand amaze at and every one must confess needs remedy tho most think it hard to find one because the constitution of the legislative be the original and supreme act of the society antecedent to all positive law in it and depend wholly on the people no inferior power can alter it and therefore the people when the legislative be once constituted have in such government a we have be speak of no power to act as long a the government stand this inconvenience be think incapable of remedy salus populi suprema lex be certainly so just and fundamental rule that he who sincerely follow it can not dangerously err if therefore the executive who have the power of convoke the legislative observing rather the true proportion than fashion of representation regulates not by old custom but true reason the number of member in all place that have right to be distinctly represent which no part of the people however incorporate can pretend to but in proportion to the assistance which it afford to the public it can not be judge to have set upnew legislative but to have restore the old and true one and to have rectify the disorder which succession of time have insensibly as well a inevitably introduce for it be the interest as well a intention of the people to havefair and equal representative whoever bring it near to that be an undoubted friend to and establish of the government and can not miss the consent and approbation of the community prerogative be nothing but power in the hand of the prince to provide for the public good in such case which depend upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrence certain and unalterable law could not safely direct whatsoever shall be do manifestly for the good of the people and the establish the government upon it true foundation be and always will be just prerogative the power of erect new corporation and therewith new representative carry with it supposition that in time the measure of representation might vary and those place have just right to be represent which before have none and by the same reason those cease to have right and be too inconsiderable for such privilege which before have it ti not change from the present state which perhaps corruption or decay have introduce that make an inroad upon the government but the tendency of it to injure or oppress the people and to set up one part or party withdistinction from and an unequal subjection of the rest whatsoever can not but be acknowledge to be of advantage to the society and people in general upon just and lasting measure will always when do justify itself and whenever the people shall chuse their representative upon just and undeniably equal measure suitable to the original frame of the government it can not be doubt to be the will and act of the society whoever permit or cause them so to do of prerogative where the legislative and executive power be in distinct hand a they be in all moderated monarchy and wellframed government there the good of the society require that several thing should be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power for the legislator not be able to foresee and provide by law for all that may be useful to the community the executor of the law have the power in hi hand have by the common law of natureright to make use of it for the good of the society in many case where the municipal law have give no direction till the legislative can conveniently be assemble to provide for it many thing there be which the law can by no mean provide for and those must necessarily be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power in hi hand to be order by him a the public good and advantage shall require nay it be fit that the law themselves should in some case give way to the executive power or rather to this fundamental law of nature and government viz that as much a may be all the member of the society be to be preserve for since many accident may happen whereinstrict and rigid observation of the law may do harm a not to pull down an innocent man house to stop the fire when the next to it be burn andman may come sometimes within the reach of the law which make no distinction of person by an action that may deserve reward and pardon ti fit the ruler should havepower in many case to mitigate the severity of the law and pardon some offender for the end of government be the preservation of all as much a may be even the guilty be to be spar where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent this power to act accord to discretion for the public good without the prescription of the law and sometimes even against it be that which be call prerogative for since in some government the lawmaking power be not always in be and be usually too numerous and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to execution and because also it be impossible to foresee and so by law to provide for all accident and necessity that may concern the public or to make such law a will do no harm if they be execute with an inflexible rigour on all occasion and upon all person that may come in their way therefore there islatitude leave to the executive power to do many thing of choice which the law do not prescribe this power whilst employ for the benefit of the community and suitably to the trust and end of the government be undoubted prerogative and never be question for the people be very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point they be far from examine prerogative whilst it be in any tolerable degree employ for the use it be mean that be for the good of the people and not manifestly against it but if there come to bequest between the executive power and the people aboutthing claim asprerogative the tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the people will easily decide that question it be easy to conceive that in the infancy of government when commonwealth differ little from family in number of people they differ from them too but little in number of law and the governor be a the father of them watch over them for their good the government be almost all prerogativefew establish law serve the turn and the discretion and care of the ruler supply the rest but when mistake or flattery prevail with weak prince to make use of this power for private end of their own and not for the public good the people be fain by express law to get prerogative determine in those point wherein they find disadvantage from it and thus declare limitation of prerogative be by the people find necessary in case which they and their ancestor have leave in the utmost latitude to the wisdom of those prince who make no other butright use of it that be for the good of their people and therefore they have very wrong notion of government who say that the people have encroach upon the prerogative when they have get any part of it to be define by positive law for in so do they have not pull from the prince any thing that of right belong to him but only declare that that power which they indefinitely leave in hi or hi ancestor hand to be exercise for their good be notthing which they intend him when he use it otherwise for the end of government be the good of the community whatsoever alteration be make in it tend to that end can not be an encroachment upon any body since no body in government can haveright tend to any other end and those only be encroachment which prejudice or hinder the public good those who say otherwise speak a if the prince haddistinct and separate interest from the good of the community and be not make for it the root and source from which spring almost all those evil and disorder which happen in kingly government and indeed if that be so the people under hi government be notsociety of rational creature enter intocommunity for their mutual good they be not such a have set ruler over themselves to guard and promote that good but be to be look on a an herd of inferior creature under the dominion ofmaster who keep them and work them for hi own pleasure or profit if men be so void of reason and brutish a to enter into society upon such term prerogative might indeed be what some men would have it an arbitrary power to do thing hurtful to the people but sincerational creature can not be suppose when free to put himself into subjection to another for hi own harm though where he find good and wise ruler he may not perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bound to hi power in all thing prerogative can be nothing but the people permit their ruler to do several thing of their own free choice where the law be silent and sometimes too against the direct letter of the law for the public good and their acquiescing in it when so do for asgood prince who be mindful of the trust put into hi hand and careful of the good of hi people can not have too much prerogative that be power to do good soweak and ill prince who would claim that power which hi predecessor exercise without the direction of the law asprerogative belonging to him by right of hi office which he may exercise at hi pleasure to make or promote an interest distinct from that of the public give the people an occasion to claim their right and limit that power which whilst it be exercise for their good they be content should be tacitly allow and therefore he that will look into the history of england will find that prerogative be always large in the hand of our wise and best prince because the people observe the whole tendency of their action to be the public good contest not what be do without law to that end or if any human frailty or mistake for prince be but men make a other appear in some small declination from that end yet twas visible the main of their conduct tend to nothing but the care of the public the people therefore find reason to be satisfy with these prince whenever they act without or contrary to the letter of the law acquiesce in what they do and without the least complaint let them inlarge their prerogative a they please judge rightly that they do nothing herein to the prejudice of their law since they act conformable to the foundation and end of all law the public good such godlike prince indeed have some title to arbitrary power by that argument that would prove absolute monarchy the best government a that which god himself govern the universe by because such king partake of hi wisdom and goodness upon this be found that say that the reign of good prince have be always most dangerous to the liberty of their people for when their successor manage the government with different thought would draw the action of those good ruler into precedent and make them the standard of their prerogative a if what have be do only for the good of the people wasright in them to do for the harm of the people if they so pleased it have often occasion contest and sometimes public disorder before the people could recover their original right and get that to be declare not to be prerogative which truly be never so since it be impossible that any body in the society should ever haveright to do the people harm though it be very possible and reasonable that the people should not go about to set any bound to the prerogative of those king or ruler who themselves transgress not the bound of the public good for prerogative be nothing but the power of do public good withoutrule the power of call parliament in england a to precise time place and duration be certainly prerogative of the king but still with this trust that it shall be make use of for the good of the nation a the exigency of the time and variety of occasion shall require for it be impossible to foresee which should always be the fit place for them to assemble in and what the best season the choice of these be leave with the executive power a might be most subservient to the public good and best suit the end of parliament the old question will be ask in this matter of prerogative but who shall be judge when this power be make right use of one answer between an executive power in be with such prerogative and legislative that depend upon hi will for their convening there can be no judge on earth a there can be none between the legislative and the people should either the executive or the legislative when they have get the power in their hand design or go about to enslave or destroy them the people have no other remedy in this a in all other case where they have no judge on earth but to appeal to heaven for the ruler in such attempt exercisingpower the people never put into their hand who can never be suppose to consent that any body should rule over them for their harm do that which they have notright to do and where the body of the people or any single man be deprive of their right or be under the exercise ofpower without right and have no appeal on earth then they haveliberty to appeal to heaven whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment and therefore though the people can not be judge so a to have by the constitution of that society any superior power to determine and give effective sentence in the case yet they have bylaw antecedent and paramount to all positive law of men reserve that ultimate determination to themselves which belong to all mankind where there lie no appeal on earth viz to judge whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven and this judgment they can not part with it be out ofmans power so to submit himself to another a to give himliberty to destroy him god and nature never allowingman so to abandon himself a to neglect hi own preservation and since he can not take away hi own life neither can he give another power to take it nor let any one think this laysperpetual foundation for disorder for this operate not till the inconveniency be so great that the majority feel it and be weary of it and findnecessity to have it amend but this the executive power or wise prince never need come in the danger of and it be the thing of all other they have most need to avoid a of all other the most perilous of paternal political and despotical power considered together though have have occasion to speak of these separately before yet the great mistake of late about government have a suppose arisen from confound these distinct power one with another it may not perhaps be amiss to consider them here together first then paternal or parental power be nothing but that which parent have over their child to govern them for the children good till they come to the use of reason orstate of knowledge wherein they may be suppose capable to understand that rule whether it be the law of nature or the municipal law of their country they be to govern themselves by capablesay to know it as well a several other who live a freeman under that law the affection and tenderness which god hath plant in the breast of parent towards their child make it evident that this be not intend to besevere arbitrary government but only for the help instruction and preservation of their offspring but happen it a it will there be ashave prove no reason why it should be think to extend to life and death at any time over their child more than over any body els neither can there be any pretence why this parental power should keep the child when grown toman in subjection to the will of hi parent any farther than have receive life and education from hi parent oblige him to respect honour gratitude assistance and support all hi life to both father and mother and thus ti true the paternal isnatural government but not at all extend itself to the end and jurisdiction of that which be political the power of the father doth not reach at all to the property of the child which be only in hi own dispose secondly political power be that power which every man have in the state of nature have give up into the hand of the society and therein to the governor whom the society hath set over itself with this express or tacit trust that it shall be employ for their good and the preservation of their property now this power which every man have in the state of nature and which he part with to the society in all such case where the society can secure him be to use such mean for the preserving of hi own property a he think good and nature allow him and to punish the breach of the law of nature in other so a accord to the best of hi reason may most conduce to the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind so that the end and measure of this power when in every man hand in the state of nature be the preservation of all of hi society that be all mankind in general it can have no other end or measure when in the hand of the magistrate but to preserve the member of that society in their life liberty and possession and so can not be an absolute arbitrary power over their life and fortune which be as much a possible to be preserve butpower to make law and annex such penalty to them a may tend to the preservation of the whole by cut off those part and those only which be so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy without which no severity be lawful and this power have it original only from compact and agreement and the mutual consent of those who make up the community thirdly despotical power be an absolute arbitrary power one man have over another to take away hi life whenever he please this ispower which neither nature give for it have make no such distinction between one man and another nor compact can convey for man not have such an arbitrary power over hi own life can not give another man suchpower over it but it be the effect only of forfeiture which the aggressor make of hi own life when he put himself into the state of war with another for have quit reason which god hath give to be the rule betwixt man and man and the common bond whereby human kind be unite into one fellowship and society and have renounce the way of peace which that teach and make use of the force of war to compass hi unjust end upon another where he have no right and so revolt from hi own kind to that of beast by make force which be theirs to be hi rule of right he render himself liable to be destroy by the injured person and the rest of mankind that will join with him in the execution of justice a any other wild beast or noxious brute with whom mankind can have neither society nor security and thus captive take injust and lawful war and such only be subject todespotical power which a it arise not from compact so neither be it capable of any but be the state of war continue for what compact can be make withman that be not master of hi own life what condition can he perform and if he be once allow to be master of hi own life the despotical arbitrary power of hi master cease he that be master of himself and hi own life hasright too to the mean of preserve it so that as soon a compact enters slavery cease and he so far quit hi absolute power and put an end to the state of war who enter into condition with hi captive another copy correct by mr locke have it thus noxious brute that be destructive to their be nature give the first of these viz paternal power to parent for the benefit of their child during their minority to supply their want of ability and understand how to manage their property by property must be understood here a in other place to mean that property which men have in their person as well a good voluntary agreement give the second viz political power to governor for the benefit of their subject to secure them in the possession and use of their property and forfeiture give the third despotical power to lord for their own benefit over those who be strip of all property he that shall consider the distinct rise and extent and the different end of these several power will plainly see that paternal power come a far short of that of the magistrate a despotical exceeds it and that absolute dominion however place be so far from be one kind of civil society that it be a inconsistent with it a slavery be with property paternal power be only where minority make the child incapable to manage hi property political where men have property in their own disposal and despotical over such a have no property at all of conquest though government can originally have no other rise than that before mention nor polity be found on any thing but the consent of the people yet such have be the disorder ambition have fill the world with that in the noise of war which make so great part of the history of mankind this consent be little take notice of and therefore many have mistake the force of arm for the consent of the people and reckon conquest a one of the original of government but conquest be a far from set up any government a demolish an house be from build new one in the place indeed it often make way fornew frame ofcommonwealth by destroy the former but without the consent of the people can never erectnew one that the aggressor who put himself into the state of war with another and unjustly invade another man right can by such an unjust war never come to have right over the conquer will be easily agree by all men who will not think that robber and pyrates have right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master or that men be bind by promise which unlawful force extorts from them should robber break into my house and with dagger at my throat make me seal deed to convey my estate to him would this give him any title just such title by hi sword have an unjust conqueror who force me into submission the injury and the crime be equal whether commit by the wearer ofcrown or some petty villain the title of the offender and the number of hi follower make no difference in the offence unless it be to aggravate it the only difference be great robber punish little one to keep them in their obedience but the great one be reward with laurel and triumph because they be too big for the weak hand of justice in this world and have the power in their own possession which should punish offender what be my remedy againstrobber that so break into my house appeal to the law for justice but perhaps justice be deny oram cripple and can not stir robbed and have not the mean to do it if god have take away all mean of seek remedy there be nothing left but patience but my son when able may seek the relief of the law whicham deny he or hi son may renew hi appeal till he recover hi right but the conquered or their child have no court no arbitrator on earth to appeal to then they may appeal a lephtha do to heaven and repeat their appeal till they have recover the native right of their ancestor which be to have suchlegislative over them a the majority should approve and freely acquiesce in if it be object this would cause endless troubleanswer no more than justice do where she lie open to all that appeal to her he that trouble hi neighbour withoutcause be punish for it by the justice of the court he appeal to and he that appeal to heaven must be sure he have right on hi side andright too that be worth the trouble and cost of the appeal a he will answer attribunal that can not be deceive and will be sure to retribute to every one accord to the mischief he hath create to hi fellow subject that be any part of mankind from whence it be plain that he that conquer in an unjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquer but suppose victory favour the right side let u considerconqueror inlawful war and see what power he get and over whom first it be plain he get no power by hi conquest over those that conquer with him they that fight on hi side can not suffer by the conquest but must at least be as much freeman a they be before and most commonly they serve upon term and on condition to share with their leader and enjoypart of the spoil and other advantage that attend the conquering sword or at least have part of the subdued country bestow upon them and the conquering people be nothope to be slave by conquest and wear their laurel only to shew they be sacrifice to their leader triumph they that find absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword make their hero who be the founder of such monarchy arrant drawcansirs and forget they have any officer and soldier that fight on their side in the battle they win or assist them in the subduing or share in possess the country they master we be tell by some that the english monarchy be found in the norman conquest and that our prince have thereby title to absolute dominion which if it be true a by the history it appear otherwise and that william hadright to make war on this island yet hi dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the saxon and briton that be then inhabitant of this country the norman that come with him and help to conquer and all descend from them be freeman and no subject by conquest let that give what dominion it will and if i or any body els shall claim freedom a derive from them it will be very hard to prove the contrary and it be plain the law that have make no distinction between the one and the other intend not there should be any difference in their freedom or privilege but suppose which seldom happen that the conqueror and conquer never incorporate into one people under the same law and freedom let u see next what powerlawful conqueror have over the subdue and that say be purely despotical he have an absolute power over the life of those who by an unjust war have forfeit them but not over the life or fortune of those who engage not in the war nor over the possession even of those who be actually engage in it secondlysay then the conqueror get no power but only over those who have actually assist concur or consent to that unjust force that be use against him for the people have give to their governor no power to do an unjust thing such a be to make an unjust war for they never have such power in themselves they ought not to be charge a guilty of the violence and unjustice that be commit in an unjust war any farther than they actually abet it no more than they be to be think guilty of any violence or oppression their governor should use upon the people themselves or any part of their fellow subject they have empower them no more to the one than to the other conqueror it be true seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together but yet this alter not the right for the conqueror power over the life of the conquered be only because they have use force to do or maintain an injustice he can have that power only over those who have concur in that force all the rest be innocent and he have no more title over the people of that country who have do him no injury and so have make no forfeiture of their life than he have over any other who without any injury or provocation have live upon fair term with him thirdly the power conqueror get over those he overcome injust war be perfectly despotical he have an absolute power over the life of those who by put themselves instate of war have forfeit them but he have not thereby right and title to their possession this doubt not but at first sight will seem strange doctrine it be so quite contrary to the practice of the world there be nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of country than to say such an one conquer it a if conquest without any more ado convey right of possession but when we consider that the practice of the strong and powerful how universal soever it may be be seldom the rule of right however it be one part of the subjection of the conquered not to argue against the condition cut out to them by the conquering sword though in all war there be usually complication of force and damage and the aggressor seldom fail to harm the estate when he use force against the person of those he make war upon yet it be the use of force only that putsman into the state of war for whether by force he begin the injury or els have quietly and by fraud do the injury he refuse to make reparation and by force maintains it which be the same thing a at first to have do it by force it be the unjust use of force that make the war for he that break open my house and violently turn me out of door or have peaceably get in by force keep me out do in effect the same thing supposing we be in suchstate that we have no common judge on earth whom may appeal to and to whom we be both oblige to submit for of sucham now speak it be the unjust use of force then that put man into the state of war with another and thereby he that be guilty of it make forfeiture of hi life for quit reason which be the rule give between man and man and use force the way of beast he become liable to be destroy by him he use force against a any savage ravenous beast that be dangerous to hi be but because the miscarriage of the father be no fault of the child and they may be rational and peaceable notwithstanding the brutish and injustice of the father the father by hi miscarriage and violence can forfeit but hi own life but involve not hi child in hi guilt or destruction hi good which nature that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much a be possible hath make to belong to the child to keep them from perish do still continue to belong to hi child for suppose them not to have join in the war either thro infancy absence or choice they have do nothing to forfeit them nor have the conqueror any right to take them away by the bare title of have subdue him that by force attempt hi destruction though perhaps he may have some right to them to repair the damage he have sustain by the war and the defence of hi own right which how far it reach to the possession of the conquer we shall see by and by so that he that by conquest have right overmans person to destroy him if he please have not therebyright over hi estate to posse and enjoy it for it be the brutal force the aggressor have use that give hi adversaryright to take away hi life and destroy him if he please asnoxious creature but it be damage sustain that alone give him title to another man good for thoughmay killthief that set on me in the highway yetmay not which seem less take away hi money and let him go this would be robbery on my side hi force and the state of war he put himself in make him forfeit hi life but give me no title to hi good the right then of conquest extends only to the life of those who join in the war not to their estate but only in order to make reparation for the damage receive and the charge of the war and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and child let the conqueror have as much justice on hi side a could be suppose he have no right to seize more than the vanquished could forfeit hi life be at the victor mercy and hi service and good he may appropriate to make himself reparation but he can not take the good of hi wife and child they too have title to the good he enjoy and their share in the estate he possess for examplein the state of nature and all commonwealth be in the state of nature one with another have injure another man and refuse to give satisfaction it come to state of war wherein my defending by force what have get unjustly make me the aggressoram conquer my life it be true a forfeit be at mercy but not my wife and children they make not the war nor assist in itcould not forfeit their life they be not mine to forfeit my wife have share in my estate that neither could forfeit and my child also be bear of me have right to be maintain out of my labour or substance here then be the case the conqueror hastitle to reparation for damage receive and the child havetitle to their father estate for their subsistence for a to the wife share whether her own labour or compact give hertitle to it it be plain her husband could not forfeit what be hers what must be do in the caseanswer the fundamental law of nature be that all as much a may be should be preserve it follow that if there be not enough fully to satisfy both viz for the conqueror loss and children maintenance he that hath and to spare must remit something of hi full satisfaction and give way to the pressing and preferable title of those who be in danger to perish without it but suppose the charge and damage of the war be to be make up to the conqueror to the utmost farthing and that the child of the vanquished spoiled of all their father good be to be leave to starve and perish yet the satisfying of what shall on this score be due to the conqueror will scarce give him title to any country he shall conquer for the damage of war can scarce amount to the value of any considerable tract of land in any part of the world where all the land be possess and none lie waste and if have not take away the conqueror land which be vanquish it be impossible should scarce any other spoilhave do him can amount to the value of mine suppose it equally cultivate and of an extent any way come near what have overrun of hi the destruction of year product or two for it seldom reach four or five be the utmost spoil that usually can be do for a to money and such rich and treasure take away these be none of nature good they have but fantastical imaginary value nature have put no such upon them they be of no more account by her standard than the wampompeke of the american to an european prince or the silver money of europe would have be formerly to an american and five year product be not worth the perpetual inheritance of land where all be possess and none remain waste to be take up by him that be disseized which will be easily grant if one do but take away the imaginary value of money the disproportion be more than between five and five hundred though at the same time halfyears product be more worth than the inheritance where there be more land than the inhabitant posse and make use of any one have liberty to make use of the waste but there conqueror take little care to possess themselves of the land of the vanquished no damage therefore that men in the state of nature a all prince and government be in reference to one another suffer from one another can giveconqueror power to dispossess the posterity of the vanquished and turn them out of that inheritance which ought to be the possession of them and their descendant to all generation the conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master and it be the very condition of the subdue not to be able to dispute their right but if that be all it give no other title than what bare force give to the strong over the weaker and by this reason he that be strongest will haveright to whatever he please to seize on over those then that join with him in the war and over those of the subdued country that oppose him not and the posterity even of those that do the conqueror even injust war hath by hi conquest no right of dominion they be free from any subjection to him and if their former government be dissolve they be at liberty to begin and erect another to themselves the conqueror it be true usually by the force he have over them compels them with sword at their breast to stoop to hi condition and submit to such government a he please to afford them but the enquiry be what right he have to do so if it be say they submit by their own consent then this allow their own consent to be necessary to give the conqueror title to rule over them it remain only to be consider whether promise extort by force without right can be think consent and how far they bind to which shall say they bind not at all because whatsoever another get from me by forcestill retain the right of and he be oblige presently to restore he that force my horse from me ought presently to restore him and have still right to retake him by the same reason he that force promise from me ought presently to restore it ie quit me of the obligation of it or may resume it myself ie chuse whetherwill perform it for the law of nature lay an obligation on me only by the rule she prescribe can not oblige me by the violation of her rule such be the extort any thing from me by force nor do it at all alter the case to saygave my promise no more than it excuse the force and pass the right whenput my hand in my pocket and deliver my purse myself tothief who demand it withpistol at my breast from all which it follow that the government of conqueror impose by force on the subdue against whom he have no right of war or who join not in the war against him where he have right have no obligation upon them but let u suppose that all the men of that community be all member of the same body politic may be take to have join in that unjust war wherein they be subdue and so their life be at the mercy of the conqueror i say this concern not their child who be in their minority for since father hath not in himselfpower over the life or liberty of hi child no act of hi can possibly forfeit it so that the child whatever may have happen to the father be freeman and the absolute power of the conqueror reach no farther than the person of the men that be subdue by him and dy with them and should he govern them a slave subject to hi absolute arbitrary power he have no such right of dominion over their child he can have no power over them but by their own consent whatever he may drive them to say or do and he have no lawful authority whilst force and not choice compels them to submission every man be bear with double right firstright of freedom to hi person which no other man have power over but the free disposal of it lie in himself secondlyright before any other man to inherit with hi brother hi father good by the first of theseman be naturally free from subjection to any government tho he be bear inplace under it jurisdiction but if he disclaim the lawful government of the country he be bear in he must also quit the right that belong to him by the law of it and the possession there descend to him from hi ancestor if it weregovernment make by their consent by the second the inhabitant of any country who be descend and derive title to their estate from those who be subdue and have government force upon them against their free consent retainright to the possession of their ancestor though they consent not freely to the government whose hard condition be by force impose on the possessor of that country for the first conqueror never have hadtitle to the land of that country the people who be the descendant of or claim under those who be force to submit to the yoke of government by constraint have always right to shake it off and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny which the sword hath bring in upon them till their ruler put them under such frame of government a they willingly and of choice consent to who doubt but the grecian christian descendant of the ancient possessor of that country may justly cast off the turkish yoke which they have so long groan under whenever they have an opportunity to do it for no government can haveright to obedience frompeople who have not freely consent to it which they can never be suppose to do till either they be put infull state of liberty to chuse their government and governor or at least till they have such stand law to which they have by themselves or their representative give their free consent and also till they be allow their due property which be so to be proprietor of what they have that no body can take away any part of it without their own consent without which men under any government be not in the state of freeman but be direct slave under the force of war but grant that the conqueror in just war have right to the estate as well a power over the person of the conquered which it be plain he hath not nothing of absolute power will follow from hence in the continuance of the government because the descendant of these be all freeman if he grant them estate and possession to inhabit hi country without which it would be worth nothing whatsoever he grant them they have so far a it be grant property in the nature whereof be that withoutmans own consent it can not be take from him their person be free by native right and their property be they more or less be their own and at their own dispose and not at hi or els it be no property suppose the conqueror give to one man thousand acre to him and hi heir for ever to another he let thousand acre for hi life under the rent of or per arm have not the one of theseright to hi thousand acre for ever and the other during hi life pay the say rent and hath not the tenant for life property in all that he get over and above hi rent by hi labour and industry during the say term suppose it be double the rent can any one say the king or conqueror after hi grant may by hi power of conqueror take away all or part of the land from the heir of one or from the other during hi life he pay the rent or can he take away from either the good or money they have get upon the say land at hi pleasure if he can then all free and voluntary contract cease and be void in the world there need nothing to dissolve them at any time but power enough and all the grant and promise of men in power be but mockery and collusion for can there be any thing more ridiculous than to saygive you and yours this for ever and that in the surest and most solemn way of conveyance can be devise and yet it be to be understood thathave right ifplease to take it away from you again to morrow i will not dispute now whether prince be exempt from the law of their country but this be sure they owe subjection to the law of god and nature no body no power can exempt them from the obligation of that eternal law those be so great and so strong in the case of promise that omnipotency itself can be tie by them grant promise and oath be bond that hold the almighty whatever some flatterer say to prince of the world who all together with all their people join to them be in comparison of the great god but asdrop of the bucket or dust on the balance inconsiderable nothing the short of the case in conquest be this the conqueror if he have just cause have despotical right over the person of all that actually aid and concur in the war against him andright to make up hi damage and cost out of their labour and estates so he injure not the right of any other over the rest of the people if there be any that consent not to the war and over the child of the captive themselves or the possession of either he have no power and so can have by virtue of conquest no lawful title himself to dominion over them or derive it to hi posterity but be an aggressor if he attempt upon their property and thereby put himself instate of war against them and have no good right of principality he nor any of hi successor than hingar or hubba the dane have here in england or spartacus have he conquer italy would have have which be to have their yoke cast off as soon a god shall give those under their subjection courage and opportunity to do it thus notwithstanding whatever title the king of assyria have over judah by the sword god assist hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquer empire and the lord be with hezekiah and he prosper wherefore he go forth and he rebel against the king of assyria and serve him not king xviiiwhence it be plain that shake offpower which force and not right hath set over any one though it hath the name of rebellion yet be no offence before god but be that which he allow and countenance though even promise and covenant when obtain by force have intervene for it be very probable to any one that read the story of ahaz and hezekiah attentively that the assyrian subdue ahaz and depose him and make hezekiah king in hi father lifetime and that hezekiah by agreement have do him homage and pay him tribute all this time of usurpation a conquest may be call foreign usurpation so usurpation be kind of domestic conquest with this difference that an usurper can never have right on hi side it be no usurpation but where one be get into the possession of what another have right to this so far a it be usurpation be change only of person but not of the form and rule of the government for if the usurper extend hi power beyond what of right belong to the lawful prince or governor of the commonwealth it be tyranny add to usurpation in all lawful government the designation of the person who be to bear rule be a natural and necessary part a the form of the government itself and be that which have it establishment originally from the people the anarchy be much alike to have no form of government at all or to agree that it shall be monarchical but to appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power and be the monarch hence all commonwealth with the form of government establish have rule also of appoint those who be to have any share in the public authority and settle method of convey the right to them for the anarchy be much alike to have no form of government at all or to agree that it shall be monarchical but to appoint no way to know or design the person that shall have the power and be the monarch whoever get into the exercise of any part of the power by other way than what the law of the community have prescribe hath no right to be obey though the form of the commonwealth be still preserve since he be not the person the law have appoint and consequently not the person the people have consent to nor can such an usurper or any derive from him ever havetitle till the people be both at liberty to consent and have actually consent to allow and confirm in him the power he hath till then usurp of tyranny a usurpation be the exercise of power which another hath right to so tyranny be the exercise of power beyond right which no body can have right to and this be make use of the power any one have in hi hand not for the good of those who be under it but for hi own private separate advantage when the governor however intitled make not the law but hi will the rule and hi command and action be not direct to the preservation of the property of hi people but the satisfaction of hi own ambition revenge covetousness or any other irregular passion if one can doubt this to be truth or reason because it come from the obscure hand ofsubjecthope the authority of king will make it pass with him king james the first in hi speech to the parliamenttells them thus i will ever prefer the weal of the public and of the whole commonwealth in make of good law and constitution to any particular and private end of mine thinking ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my great weal and worldly felicitypoint whereinlawful king doth directly differ fromtyrant fordo acknowledge that the special and great point of difference that be between rightful king and an usurping tyrant be this that whereas the proud and ambitious tyrant doth think hi kingdom and people be only ordain for satisfaction of hi desire and unreasonable appetite the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordain for the procuring of the wealth and property of hi people and again in hi speech to the parliamenthe hath these word the king bind himself by double oath to the observation of the fundamental law of hi kingdom tacitly a by be king and so bound to protect as well the people a the law of hi kingdom and expressly by hi oath at hi coronation so a every just king insettled kingdom be bind to observe that paction make to hi people by hi law in frame hi government agreeable thereunto accord to that paction which god make with noah after the deluge hereafter seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease while the earth remaineth and thereforeking govern insettled kingdom leave to beking and degenerate intotyrant as soon a he leave off to rule accord to hi law and little after therefore all king that be not tyrant or perjure will be glad to bind themselves within the limit of their law and they that persuade them the contrary be viper and pest both against them and the commonwealth thus that learn king who well understood the notion of thing make the difference bet wixt king and tyrant to consist only in this that one make the law the bound of hi power and the good of the public the end of hi government the other make all give way to hi own will and appetite it be mistake to think this fault be proper only to monarchy other form of government be liable to it as well a that for wherever the power that be put in any hand for the government of the people and the preservation of their property be apply to other end and make use of to impoverish harass or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular command of those that have it there it presently become tyranny whether those that thus use it be one or many thus we read of the thirty tyrant at athens as well a one at syracuse and the intolerable dominion of the decemviri at rome be nothing well whereever law end tyranny begin if the law be transgress to anothers harm and whosoever in authority exceed the power give him by the law and make use of the force he have under hi command to compass that upon the subject which the law allow not cease in that to bemagistrate and act without authority may be oppose a any other man who by force invades the right of another this be acknowledge in subordinate magistrate he that hath authority to seize my person in the street may be oppose asthief androbber if he endeavour to break into my house to executewrit notwithstanding thatknow he have suchwarrant and suchlegal authority a will impower him to arrest me abroad and why this should not hold in the high as well a in the most inferior magistratewould gladly be inform be it reasonable that the eldest brother because he have the great part of hi father estate should thereby haveright to take away any of hi young brother portion or that rich man who possess whole country should from thence haveright to seize when he please the cottage and garden of hi poor neighbour the be rightfully possess of great power and rich exceedingly beyond the great part of the son of adam be so far from be an excuse much lessreason for rapine and oppression which the endamaging another without authority be that it isgreat aggravation of it for the exceed the bound of authority be no moreright ingreat than inpetty officer no more justifiable ink thanconstable but be so much the worse in him in that he have more trust put in him have alreadymuch great share than the rest of hi brother and be suppose from the advantage of hi education employment and counsellor to be more knowing in the measure of right and wrong may the command then of prince be oppose may he be resist as often a any one shall find himself aggrieve and but imagine he have not right do him this will unhinge and overturn all polity and instead of government and order leave nothing but anarchy and confusion to thisanswer that force be to be oppose to nothing but to unjust and unlawful force whoever make any opposition in any other case draw on himself just condemnation both from god and man and so no such danger or confusion will follow a be often suggest for first a in some country the person of the prince by the law be sacred and so whatever he command or do hi person be still free from all question or violence not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemnation but yet opposition may be make to the illegal act of any inferior officer or other commission by him unless he will by actually put himself into state of war with hi people dissolve the government and leave them to that defence which belong to every one in the state of nature for of such thing who can tell what the end will be and neighbour kingdom have shew the world an odd example in all other case the sacredness of the person exempt him from all inconveniencies whereby he be secure whilst the government stand from all violence and harm whatsoever than which there can not be wise constitution for the harm he can do in hi own person not be likely to happen often nor to extend itself far nor be able by hi single strength to subvert the law nor oppress the body of the people should any prince have so much weakness and ill nature a to be willing to do it the inconveniency of some particular mischief that may happen sometimes whenheady prince come to the throne be well recompense by the peace of the public and security of the government in the person of the chief magistrate thus set out of the reach of danger it be safer for the body that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer than that the head of the republic should be easily and upon slight occasion expose secondly but this privilege belong only to the king person hinders not but they may be question opposed and resist who use unjust force though they pretend commission from him which the law authorize not a be plain in the case of him that have the king writ to arrestman which isfull commission from the king and yet he that have it can not break openmans house to do it nor execute this command of the king upon certain day nor in certain place though this commission have no such exception in it but they be the limitation of the law which if any one transgress the king commission excuse him not for the king authority be give him only by the law he can not impower any one to act against the law or justify him by hi commission in so do the commission or command of any magistrate where he have no authority be a void and insignificant a that of any private man the difference between the one and the other be that the magistrate have some authority so far and to such end and the private man have none at all for it be not the commission but the authority that give the right of act and against the law there can be no authority but notwithstanding such resistance the king person and authority be still both secure and so no danger to governor or government thirdly suppose government wherein the person of the chief magistrate be not thus sacred yet this doctrine of the lawfulness of resist all unlawful exercise of hi power will not upon every slight occasion in danger him or imbroil the government for where the injured party may be relieve and hi damage repair by appeal to the law there can be no pretence for force which be only to be use where man be intercept from appeal to the law for nothing be to be account hostile force but where it leave not the remedy of such an appeal and it be such force alone that put him that use it into state of war and make it lawful to resist himman with sword in hi hand demand my purse in the highway when perhapshave not twelve penny in my pocket this man may lawfully kill to another deliver pound to hold only whilstalight which he refuse to restore me whenam get up again but draw hi sword to defend the possession of it by force if endeavour to retake it the mischief this man do me be hundred or possibly thousand time more than the other perhaps intend me whom kill before he really do me any and yetmight lawfully kill the one and can not so much a hurt the other lawfully the reason whereof be plain because the one use force which threaten my lifecould not have time to appeal to the law to secure it and when it be go it be too late to appeal the law could not restore life to my dead carcass the loss be irreparable which to prevent the law of nature give meright to destroy him who have put himself intostate of war with me and threaten my destruction but in the other case my life not be in dangermay have the benefit of appeal to the law and have reparation for my pound that way fourthly but if the unlawful act do by the magistrate be maintain by the power he have get and the remedy which be due by law be by the same power obstruct yet the right of resist even in such manifest act of tyranny will not suddenly or on slight occasion disturb the government for if it reach no farther than some private men case though they have right to defend themselves and to recover by force what by unlawful force be take from them yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in contest wherein they be sure to perish it be a impossible for one or few oppress men to disturb the government where the body of the people do not think themselves concern in it a forraving madman or heady malcontent to overturnwell settle state the people be a little apt to follow the one a the other but if either these illegal act have extend to the majority of the people or if the mischief and oppression have light only on some few but in such case a the precedent and consequence seem to threaten all and they be persuade in their conscience that their law and with them their estate liberty and life be in danger and perhaps their religion too how they will be hinder from resist illegal force use against themcannot tell this be an inconvenienceconfess that attend all government whatsoever when the governor have bring it to this pas to be generally suspect of their people the most dangerous state which they can possibly put themselves in wherein they be the less to be pity because it be so easy to be avoid it be a impossible for governor if he really mean the good of hi people and the preservation of them and their law together not to make them see and feel it a it be for the father of family not to let hi child see he love and take care of them but if all the world shall observe pretence of one kind and action of another art use to elude the law and the trust of prerogative which be an arbitrary power in some thing leave in the prince hand to do good not harm to the people employ contrary to the end for which it be give if the people shall find the minister and subordinate magistrate choose suitable to such end and favour or lay by proportion a they promote or oppose them if they see several experiment make of arbitrary power and that religion underhand favour tho publicly proclaim against which be readiest to introduce it and the operator in it support as much a may be and when that can not be do yet approve still and like the good if long train of action shew the council all tend that way how can man any more hinder himself from be persuade in hi own mind which way thing be go or from cast about how to save himself than he could from believe the captain of the ship he be in be carry him and the rest of the company to algiers when he find him always steer that course though cross wind leak in hi ship and want of men and provision do often force him to turn hi course another way for some time which he steadily return to again as soon a the wind weather and other circumstance would let him of the dissolution of government he that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of government ought in the first place to distinguish between the dissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government that which make the community and brings men out of the loose state of nature into one politic society be the agreement which every one have with the rest to incorporate and act a one body and so be one distinct commonwealth the usual and almost only way whereby this union be dissolve be the inroad of foreign force make conquest upon them for in that case not be able to maintain and support themselves a one intire and independent body the union belonging to that body which consist therein must necessarily cease and so every one return to the state he be in before with liberty to shift for himself and provide for hi own safety a he think fit in some other society whenever the society be dissolve it be certain the government of that society can not remain thus conqueror sword often cut up government by the root and mangle society to piece separate the subdued or scatter multitude from the protection of and dependence on that society which ought to have preserve them from violence the world be too well instruct in and too forward to allow of this way of dissolving of government to need any more to be say of it and there want not much argument to prove that where the society be dissolve the government can not remain that be as impossible a for the frame of an house to subsist when the material of it be scattered and dissipated bywhirlwind or jumble intoconfused heap by an earthquake besides this overturn from without government be dissolve from within first when the legislative be alter civil society be state of peace amongst those who be of it from whom the state of war be exclude by the umpirage which they have provide in their legislative for the end all difference that may arise amongst any of them it be in their legislative that the member of commonwealth be united and combine together into one coherent living body this be the soul that give form life and unity to the commonwealth from hence the several member have their mutual influence sympathy and connexion and therefore when the legislative be break or dissolve dissolution and death follow for the essence and union of the society consist in have one will the legislative when once establish by the majority have the declaring and a it be keep of that will the constitution of the legislative be the first and fundamental act of society whereby provision be make for the continuation of their union under the direction of person and bond of law make by person authorize thereunto by the consent and appointment of the people without which no one man or number of men amongst them can have authority of make law that shall be bind to the rest when any one or more shall take upon them to make law whom the people have not appoint so to do they make law without authority which the people be not therefore bound to obey by which mean they come again to be out of subjection and may constitute to themselvesnew legislative a they think best be in full liberty to resist the force of those who without authority would impose any thing upon them every one be at the disposure of hi own will when those who have by the delegation of the society the declaring of the public will be exclude from it and other usurp the place who have no such authority or delegation this be usually bring about by such in the commonwealth who misuse the power they have it be hard to consider it aright and know at whose door to lay it without know the form of government in which it happen let u suppose then the legislative place in the concurrence of three distinct person single hereditary person have the constant supreme executive power and with it the power of convoking and dissolve the other two within certain period of time an assembly of hereditary nobility an assembly of representative choose pro tempore by the people such form of government suppose it be evident first that when such single person or prince set up hi own arbitrary will in place of the law which be the will of the society declare by the legislative then the legislative be change for that be in effect the legislative whose rule and law be put in execution and require to be obey when other law be set up and other rule pretend and inforced than what the legislative constitute by the society have enact it be plain that the legislative be change whoever introduce new law not be thereunto authorize by the fundamental appointment of the society or subvert the old disowns and overturn the power by which they be make and so sets upnew legislative secondly when the prince hinder the legislative from assemble in it due time or from act freely pursuant to those end for which it be constitute the legislative be alter for it be not certain number of men no nor their meeting unless they have also freedom of debate and leisure of perfect what be for the good of the society wherein the legislative consist when these be take away or alter so a to deprive the society of the due exercise of their power the legislative be truly altered for it be not name that constitute government but the use and exercise of those power that be intend to accompany them so that he who take away the freedom or hinder the acting of the legislative in it due season in effect take away the legislative and put an end to the government thirdly when by the arbitrary power of the prince the elector or way of election be alter without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people there also the legislative be alter for if other than those whom the society hath authorize thereunto do chuse or in another way than what the society hath prescribe those chosen be not the legislative appoint by the people fourthly the delivery also of the people into the subjection of foreign power either by the prince or by the legislative be certainly change of the legislative and so dissolution of the government for the end why people enter into society be to be preserve one intire free independent society to be govern by it own law this be lose whenever they be give up into the power of another why in such constitution a this the dissolution of the government in these case be to be impute to the prince be evident because he have the force treasure and office of the state to employ and often persuade himself or be flatter by other that a supreme magistrate he be uncapable of controul he alone be incondition to make great advance toward such change under pretence of lawful authority and have it in hi hand to terrify or suppress opposer a factious seditious and enemy to the government whereas no other part of the legislative or people be capable by themselves to attempt any alteration of the legislative without open and visible rebellion apt enough to be take notice of which when it prevail produce effect very little different from foreign conquest besides the prince in such form of government have the power of dissolve the other part of the legislative and thereby render them private person they can never in opposition to him or without hi concurrence alter the legislative bylaw hi consent be necessary to give any of their decree that sanction but yet so far a the other part of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government and do either promote or not what lie in them hinder such design they be guilty and partake in this which be certa inly the great crime which men can partake of one towards another sec there be one way more whereby such government may be dissolve and that be when he who have the supreme executive power neglect and abandon that charge so that the law already make can no longer be put in execution this be demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy and so effectually to dissolve the government for law not be make for themselves but to be by their execution the bond of the society to keep every part of the body politic in it due place and function when that totally cease the government visibly cease and the people become confused multitude without order or connexion where there be no longer the administration of justice for the securing of men right nor any remain power within the community to direct the force or provide for the necessity of the public there certainly be no government leave where the law can not be execute it be all one a if there be no law andgovernment without law issupposemystery in politics unconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with human society in these and the like case when the government be dissolve the people be at liberty to provide for themselves by erect new legislative differing from the other by the change of person or form or both a they shall find it most for their safety and good for the society can never by the fault of another lose the native and original right it have to preserve itself which can only be do by settled legislative and fair and impartial execution of the law make by it but the state of mankind be not so miserable that they be not capable of use this remedy till it be too late to look for any to tell people they may provide for themselves by erect new legislative when by oppression artifice or be deliver over to foreign power their old one be go be only to tell them they may expect relief when it be too late and the evil be past cure this be in effect no more than to bid them first be slave and then to take care of their liberty and when their chain be on tell them they may act like freeman this if barely so be rather mockery than relief and men can never be secure from tyranny if there be no mean to escape it till they be perfectly under it and therefore it be that they have not only right to get out of it but to prevent it there be therefore secondly another way whereby government be dissolve and that be when the legislative or the prince either of them act contrary to their trust first the legislative act against the trust repose in them when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject and to make themselves or any part of the community master or arbitrary disposers of the life liberty or fortune of the people the reason why men enter into society be the preservation of their property and the end why they chuse and authorize legislative be that there may be law make and rule set a guard and fence to the property of all the member of the society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every part and member of the society for since it can never be suppose to be the will of the society that the legislative should have power to destroy that which every one design to secure by enter into society and for which the people submit themselves to legislator of their own making whenever the legislator endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power they put themselves into state of war with the people who be thereupon absolve from any farther obedience and be leave to the common refuge which god hath provide for all men against force and violence whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavour to grasp themselves or put into the hand of any other an absolute power over the life liberty and estate of the people by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people have put into their hand for quite contrary end and it devolve to the people who haveright to resume their original liberty and by the establishment ofnew legislative such a they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which be the end for which they be in society what have say here concern the legislative in general hold true also concern the supreme executor who have double trust put in him both to have part in the legislative and the supreme execution of the law act against both when he go about to set up hi own arbitrary will a the law of the society he act also contrary to hi trust when he either employ the force treasure and office of the society to corrupt the representative and gain them to hi purpose or openly pre engage the elector and prescribes to their choice such whom he have by sollicitations threat promise or otherwise win to hi design and employ them to bring in such who have promise beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate candidate and elector and newmodel the way of election what be it but to cut up the government by the root and poison the very fountain of public security for the people have reserve to themselves the choice of their representative a the fence to their property could do it for no other end but that they might always be freely choose and so chosen freely act and advise a the necessity of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examination and mature debate be judge to require this those who give their vote before they hear the debate and have weigh the reason on all side be not capable of do to prepare such an assembly a this and endeavour to set up the declared abettor of hi own will for the true representative of the people and the lawmaker of the society be certainly as great breach of trust and a perfect declaration of design to subvert the government a be possible to be meet with to which if one shall add reward and punishment visibly employ to the same end and all the art of perverted law make use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such design and will not comply and consent to betray the liberty of their country it will be past doubt what be do what power they ought to have in the society who thus employ it contrary to the trust go along with it in it first institution be easy to determine and one can not but see that he who have once attempt any such thing a this can not any longer be trust to this perhaps it will be say that the people be ignorant and always discontent to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people be to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up new legislative whenever they take offence at the old one to this answer quite the contrary people be not so easily get out of their old form a some be apt to suggest they be hardly to be prevail with to amend the acknowledged fault in the frame they have be accustom to and if there be any original defect or adventitious one introduce by time or corruption it be not an easy thing to get them change even when all the world see there be an opportunity for it this slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitution have in the many revolution which have be see in this kingdom in this and former age still keep u to or after some interval of fruitless attempt still bring u back again to our old legislative of king lord and common and whatever provocation have make the crown be take from some of our prince head they never carry the people so far a to place it in another line but it will be say this hypothesis lay ferment for frequent rebellion to which answer first no more than any other hypothesis for when the people be make miserable and find themselves expose to the ill usage of arbitrary power cry up their governor as much a you will for son of jupiter let them be sacred and divine descend or authorize from heaven give them out for whom or what you please the same will happen the people generally ill treat and contrary to right will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of burden that sit heavy upon them they will wish and seek for the opportunity which in the change weakness and accident of human affair seldom delay long to offer itself he must have live but little while in the world who have not see example of this in hi time and he must have read very little who can not produce example of it in all sort of government in the world secondlyanswer such revolution happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affair great mistake in the rule part many wrong and inconvenient law and all the slip of human frailty will be bear by the people without mutiny or murmur but if long train of abuse prevarication and artifice all tend the same way make the design visible to the people and they can not but feel what they lie under and see whither they be go it be not to be wonder that they should then rouze themselves and endeavour to put the rule into such hand which may secure to them the end for which government be at first erect and without which ancient name and specious form be so far from be good that they be much bad than the state of nature or pure anarchy the inconveniencies be all a great and a near but the remedy farther off and more difficult thirdlyanswer that this doctrine of power in the people of provide for their safety anew by new legislative when their legislator have act contrary to their trust by invade their property be the best fence against rebellion and the probablest mean to hinder it for rebellion be an opposition not to person but authority which be found only in the constitution and law of the government those whoever they be who by force break through and by force justify their violation of them be truly and properly rebel for when men by enter into society and civilgovernment have exclude force and introduce law for the preservation of property peace and unity amongst themselves those who set up force again in opposition to the law do rebellare that be bring back again the state of war and be properly rebel which they who be in power by the pretence they have to authority the temptation of force they have in their hand and the flattery of those about them be likeliest to do the proper way to prevent the evil be to shew them the danger and injustice of it who be under the great temptation to run into it in both the forementioned case when either the legislative be change or the legislator act contrary to the end for which they be constitute those who be guilty be guilty of rebellion for if any one by force take away the established legislative of any society and the law by them make pursuant to their trust he thereby take away the um pirage which every one have consent to for peaceable decision of all their controversy and bar to the state of war amongst them they who remove or change the legislative take away this decisive power which no body can have but by the appointment and consent of the people and so destroy the authority which the people do and no body els can set up and introduce power which the people hath not authorize they actually introduce state of war which be that of force without authority and thus by remove the legislative establish by the society in whose decision the people acquiesce and unite a to that of their own will they untie the knot and expose the people anew to the state of war and if those who by force take away the legislative be rebel the legislator themselves a have be shew can be no less esteem so when they who be set up for the protection and preservation of the people their liberty and property shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away and so they put themselves into state of war with those who make them the protector and guardian of their peace be properly and with the great aggravation rebellantes rebel but if they who say it lay foundation for rebellion mean that it may occasion civil war or intestine broil to tell the people they be absolve from obedience when illegal attempt be make upon their liberty or property and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who be their magistrate when they invade their property contrary to the trust put in them and that therefore this doctrine be not to be allow be so destructive to the peace of the world they may as well say upon the same ground that honest men may not oppose robber or pirate because this may occasion disorder or bloodshed if any mischief come in such case it be not to be charge upon him who defend hi own right but on him that invade hi neighbour if the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he have for peace sake to him who will lay violent hand upon itdesire it may be consider what kind of peace there will be in the world which consist only in violence and rapine and which be to be maintain only for the benefit of robber and oppressor who would not think it an admirable peace betwix the mighty and the mean when the lamb without resistance yield hi throat to be tear by the imperious wolf polyphemuss den give u perfect pattern of such peace and such government wherein ulysses and hi companion have nothing to do but quietly to suffer themselves to be devour and no doubt ulysses who be prudent man preach up passive obedience and exhort them to quiet submission by represent to them of what concern peace be to mankind and by shew the inconvenience might happen if they should offer to resist polyphemus who have now the power over them the end of government be the good of mankind and which be best for mankind that the people should be always expose to the boundless will of tyranny or that the ruler should be sometimes liable to be oppose when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power and employ it for the destruction and not the preservation of the property of their people nor let any one say that mischief can arise from hence as often a it shall please busy head or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government it be true such men may stir whenever they please but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition for till the mischief be grow general and the ill design of the ruler become visible or their attempt sensible to the great part the people who be more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance be not apt to stir the example of particular injustice or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man move them not but if they universally have persuation ground upon manifest evidence that design be carry on against their liberty and the general course and tendency of thing can not but give them strong suspicion of the evil intention of their governor who be to be blame for it who can help it if they who might avoid it bring themselves into this suspicion be the people to be blame if they have the sense of rational creature and can think of thing no otherwise than a they find and feel them and be it not rather their fault who put thing into such posture that they would not have them think to be a they aregrant that the pride ambition and turbulency of private men have sometimes cause great disorder in commonwealth and faction have be fatal to state and kingdom but whether the mischief hath oftener begin in the people wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their ruler or in the ruler insolence and endeavour to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people whether oppression or disobedience give the first rise to the disorderleave it to impartial history to determine this be sure whoever either ruler or subject by force go about to invade the right of either prince or people and lay the foundation for overturn the constitution and frame of any just government be highly guilty of the great crimethinkman be capable of be to answer for all those mischief of blood rapine and desolation which the breaking to piece of government bring on country and he who do it be justly to be esteem the common enemy and pest of mankind and be to be treat accordingly that subject or foreigner attempt by force on the property of any people may be resist with force be agree on all hand but that magistrates do the same thing may be resist hath of late be deny a if those who have the great privilege and advantage by the law have thereby power to break those law by which alone they be set in good place than their brother whereas their offence be thereby the great both a be ungrateful for the great share they have by the law and breaking also that trust which be put into their hand by their brother whosoever use force without right a every one do in society who do it without law put himself into state of war with those against whom he so use it and in that state all former tie be cancel all other right cease and every one have right to defend himself and to resist the aggressor this be so evident that barclay himself that great a sertor of the power and sacredness of king be force to confess that it be lawful for the people in some case to resist their king and that too in chapter wherein he pretend to shew that the divine law shut up the people from all manner of rebellion whereby it be evident even by hi own doctrine that since they may in some case resist all resisting of prince be not rebellion hi word be these quod
