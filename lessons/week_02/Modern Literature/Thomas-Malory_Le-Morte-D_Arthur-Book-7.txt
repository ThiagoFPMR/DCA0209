i allow thee for yonder knight that thou killest nay truly for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly therefore turn again bawdy kitchen page i know thee well for sir kay name thee beaumains what art

be the knight bounden and then he ride unto them and strike one unto the death and then another and at the third stroke he slew the third thief and then the other three flee and he ride after them and he overtake them and then those three thief turn again and assail beaumains hard but at the last he slew them and return and unbound the knight and the knight thank him and pray him to ride with him to hi castle there a little beside and he should worship reward him for hi good deed sir say beaumains i will no reward have i be this day make knight of noble sir launcelot and therefore i will no

fell down in the water and there be he drown and then he spur hi horse upon the land where the other knight fell upon him and brake hi spear and so they draw their sword and fought long together at the last sir beaumains clave hi helm and hi head down to the shoulder and so he ride unto the damosel and bid her ride forth on her way ala she say that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to destroy such two doughty knight thou weenest thou hast do doughtily that be not so for the first knight hi horse stumble and there he be drown in the water and never it be by thy force nor by thy might and the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him and mishappily thou slew him damosel say beaumains ye may say what ye will but with whomsomever i have ado withal i trust to god to serve him or he depart and therefore i reck not what ye say so that i may win your lady fie fie foul kitchen knave thou shalt see knight that shall abate thy boast fair damosel give me goodly language and then my care be past for what knight somever they be i care not nor i doubt them not also say she i say it for thine avail yet mayest thou turn again with thy worship for an thou follow me thou art but slain for i see all that ever thou dost be but by misadventure and not by prowess of thy hand well damosel ye may say what ye will but wheresomever ye go i will follow you so this beaumains rode with that lady till evensong time and ever she chide him and would not rest and they come to a black laund and there be a black hawthorn and thereon hung a black banner and on the other side there hang a black shield and by it stand a black spear great and long and a great black horse cover with silk and a black stone fast by there sit a knight all arm in black harness and hi name be the knight of the

knight when she come nigh him spake and say damosel have ye bring this knight of king arthur to be your champion nay fair knight say she this be but a kitchen knave that be feed in king arthur kitchen for alms why cometh he say the knight in such array it be shame that he beareth you company sir i can not be deliver of him say she for with me he rideth maugre mine head god would that ye should put him from me other to slay him an ye may for he be an unhappy knave and unhappily he hath do this day through mishap i saw him slay two knight at the passage of the water and other deed he do before right marvellous and through unhappiness that marvelleth me say the black knight that any man that be of worship will have ado with him they know him not say the damosel and for because he rideth with me they ween that he be some man of worship bear that may be say the black knight howbeit a ye say that he be no man of worship he be a full likely person and full like to be a strong man but thus much shall i grant you say the black knight i shall put him down upon one foot and hi horse and hi harness he shall leave with me for it be shame to me to do him any more harm when sir beaumains hear him say thus he say sir knight thou art full large of my horse and my harness i let thee wit it cost thee nought and whether it liketh thee or not this laund will i pass maugre thine head and horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine but if thou win them with thy hand and therefore let see what thou canst do sayest thou that say the black knight now yield thy lady from thee for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady thou li say beaumains i be a gentleman bear and of more high lineage than thou and that will i prove on thy body then in great wrath they depart with their horse and come together a it have be the thunder and the black knight spear brake and beaumains thrust him through both hi side and therewith hi spear brake and the truncheon leave still in hi side but nevertheless the black knight draw hi sword and smite many eager stroke and of great might and hurt beaumains full sore but at the last the black knight within an hour and an half he fell down off hi horse in swoon and there he die and when beaumains saw him so well horse and arm then he alight down and arm him in hi armour and so take hi horse and rode after the damosel when she saw him come nigh she say away kitchen knave out of the wind for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me ala she say that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight a thou hast do but all this be thine unhappiness but here by be one shall pay thee all thy payment and therefore yet i counsel thee flee it may happen me say beaumains to be beat or slay but i warn you fair damosel i will not flee away a nor leave your company for all that ye can say for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me but howsomever it happeneth i escape and they lie on the ground and therefore it be as good for you to hold you still thus all day rebuke me for away will i not till i see the uttermost of this journey or els i will be slain other truly beaten therefore ride on your way for follow you i will whatsomever happen thus a they ride together they saw a knight come driving by them all in green both hi horse and hi harness and when he come nigh the damosel he ask her be that my brother the black knight that ye have bring with you nay nay she say this unhappy kitchen knave hath slay your brother through unhappiness ala say the green knight that be great pity that so noble a knight a he be should so unhappily be slay and namely of a knave hand a ye say that he be ah traitor say the green knight thou shalt die for slaying of my brother he be a full noble knight and hi name be sir perard i defy thee say beaumains for i let thee wit i slew him knightly and not shamefully therewithal the green knight rode unto an horn that be green and it hang upon a thorn and there he blow three deadly mote and there come two damosel and arm him lightly and then he take a great horse and a green shield and a green spear and then they run together with all their might and brake their spear unto their hand and then they draw their sword and give many sad stroke and either of them wound other full ill and at the last at an overthwart beaumains with hi horse strike the green knight horse upon the side that he fell to the earth and then the green knight avoid hi horse lightly and dress him upon foot that saw beaumains and therewithal he alight and they rush together like two mighty kemps a long while and sore they bleed both with that come the damosel and say my lord the green knight why for shame stand ye so long fight with the kitchen knave ala it be shame that ever ye be make knight to see such a lad to match such a knight a the weed overgrow the corn therewith the green knight be ashamed and therewithal he give a great stroke of might and clave hi shield through when beaumains saw hi shield cloven asunder he be a little ashamed of that stroke and of her language and then he give him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell on hi knee and so suddenly beaumains pull him upon the ground grovelling and then the green knight cry him mercy and yield him unto sir beaumains and pray him to slay him not all be in vain say beaumains for thou shalt die but if this damosel that come with me pray me to save thy life and therewithal he unlace hi helm like a he would slay him fie upon thee false kitchen page i will never pray thee to save hi life for i will never be so much in thy danger then shall he die say beaumains not so hardy thou bawdy knave say the damosel that thou slay him ala say the green knight suffer me not to die for a fair word may save me fair

commandment hi life shall be save and els not then he say sir knight with the green arm i release thee quit at this damosel request for i will not make her wroth i will fulfil all that she chargeth me and then the green knight kneel down and do him homage with hi sword then say the damosel me repenteth green knight of your damage and of your brother death the black knight for of your help i have great mister for i dread me sore to pass this forest nay dread you not say the green knight for ye shall lodge with me this night and tomorn i shall help you through this forest so they take their horse and rode to hi manor which be fast there beside and ever she rebuke beaumains and would not suffer him to sit at her table but a the green knight take him and sit him at a side table marvel methinketh say the green knight to the damosel why ye rebuke this noble knight a ye do for i warn you damosel he be a full noble knight and i know no knight be able to match him therefore ye do great wrong to rebuke him for he shall do you right good service for whatsomever he maketh himself ye shall prove at the endthat he be come of a noble blood and of king lineage fie fie say the damosel it be shame for you to say of him such worship truly say the green knight it be shame for me to say of him any disworship for he hath prove himself a good knight than i be yet have i meet with many knight in my day and never or this time have i find no knight hi match and so that night they yede unto rest and all that night the green knight command thirty knight privily to watch beaumains for to keep

that be at my commandment and i forgive thee all the despite that thou hast do to me and the death of my brother the black knight all this availeth not say beaumains but if my damosel pray me to save thy life and therewith he make semblant to strike off hi head let be thou beaumains slay him not for he be a noble knight and not so hardy upon thine head but thou save him then beaumains bid the red knight stand up and thank the damosel now of thy life then the red knight pray him to see hi castle and to be there all night so the damosel then grant him and there they have merry cheer but always the damosel spake many foul word unto beaumains whereof the red knight have great marvel and all that night the red knight make three score knight to watch beaumains that he should have no shame nor

that i win worship well say she right soon there shall meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wage for he be the most man of worship of the world except king arthur i will well say beaumains the more he

that seem new mown and therein be many pavilion fair to behold lo say the damosel yonder be a lord that owneth yonder city and hi custom be when the weather be fair to lie in this meadow to joust and tourney and ever there be about him five hundred knight and gentleman of arm and there be all manner of game that any gentleman can devise that goodly lord say beaumains would i fain see thou shalt see him time enough say the damosel and so a she ride near she espy the pavilion where he be lo say she seest thou yonder pavilion that be all of the colour of inde and all manner of thing that there be about men and woman and horse trap shield and spear be all of the colour of inde and hi name be sir persant of inde the most lordly knight that ever thou lookedst on it may well be say beaumains but be he never so stout a knight in this field i shall abide till that i see him under hi shield ah fool say she thou wert good flee betimes why say beaumains an he be such a knight a ye make him he will not set upon me with all hi men or with hi five hundred knight for an there come no more but one at once i shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth fie fie say the damosel that ever such a stink knave should blow such a boast damosel he say ye be to blame so to rebuke me for i have liefer do five battle than so to be rebuke let him come and then let him do hi bad sir she say i marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come boldly thou speakest and boldly thou hast do that have i see therefore i pray thee save thyself an thou mayest for thy horse and thou have have great travail and i dread we dwell over long from the siege for it be but hence seven mile and all perilous passage we be pass save all only this passage and here i dread me sore l ye shall catch some hurt therefore i would ye be hence that ye be not bruise nor hurt with this strong knight but i let you wit that sir persant of inde be nothing of might nor strength unto the knight that lay the siege about my lady a for that say sir beaumains be it a it be may for sithen i be come so nigh this knight i will prove hi might or i depart from him and els i shall be sham an i now withdraw me from him and therefore damosel have ye no doubt by the grace of god i shall so deal with this knight that within two hour after noon i shall deliver him and then shall we come to the siege by daylight o jesu marvel have i say the damosel what manner a man ye be for it may never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood for so foul nor shamefully do never woman rule a knight a i have do you and ever courteously ye have suffer me and that come never but of a gentle blood damosel say beaumains a knight may little do that may not suffer a damosel for whatsomever ye say unto me i take none heed to your word for the more ye say the more ye anger me and my wrath i wreak upon them that i have ado withal and therefore all the missaying that ye missaid me further me in my battle and cause me to think to show and prove myself at the endwhat i be for peradventure though i have meat in king arthur kitchen yet i might have have meat enough in other place but all that i do it for to prove and assay my friend and that shall be know another day and whether that i be a gentleman born or none i let you wit fair damosel i have do you gentleman service and peradventure well service yet will i do or i depart from you alas she say fair beaumains forgive me all that i have missaid or do against thee with all my heart say he i forgive it you for ye do nothing but a ye should do for all your evil word please me and damosel say beaumains since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me wit ye well it gladdeth my heart greatly and now meseemeth there be no knight living but i be able enough for him with this sir

they avoid their horse and put their shield afore them and draw their sword and give many great stroke that sometime they hurtle together that they fell grovel on the ground thus they fight two hour and more that their shield and their hauberk be all forhewen and in many stead they be wound so at the last sir beaumains smite him through the cost of the body and then he retrayed him here and there and knightly maintain hi battle long time and at the last though him loath be beaumains smote sir persant above upon the helm that he fell grovel to the earth and then he leap upon him overthwart and

saracen and sir safer hi brother also sir bleoberis and sir blamore de ganis hi brother also sir bors de ganis and sir ector de mari and sir percivale de galis these and many more be noble knight but there be none that pass the three above say therefore god speed you well say sir persant for an ye may match the red knight ye shall be call the fourth of the world sir say beaumains i would fain be of good fame and of knighthood and i let you wit i come of good men for i dare say my father be a noble man and so that ye will keep it in close and this damosel i will tell you of what kin i be we

be dame morgawse and sir gawain be my brother and sir agravaine and sir gaheris and i be the young of them all and yet wot not king arthur nor sir gawain what i be so the book saith that the lady that be besiege have word of her sister come by the dwarf and a knight with her and how he have pass all the perilous passage what manner a man be he say the lady he be a noble knight truly madam say the dwarf and but a young man but he be as likely a man a ever ye saw any what be he say the damosel and of what kin be he come and of whom be he make knight madam say the dwarf he be the king son of orkney but hi name i will not tell you as at this time but wit ye well of sir launcelot be he make knight for of none other would he be make knight and sir kay name him beaumains how escape he say the lady from the brother of persant madam he say a a noble knight should first he slew two brother at a passage of a water ah say she they be good knight but they be murderer the one hight gherard le breuse and the other knight hight sir arnold le breuse then madam he recount with the black knight and slew him in plain battle and so he take hi horse and hi armour and fought with the green knight and win him in plain battle and in like wise he serve the red knight and after in the same wise he serve the blue knight and win him in plain battle then say the lady he hath overcome sir persant of inde one of the noble knight of the world and the dwarf say he hath win all the four brother and slay the black knight and yet he do more tofore he overthrow sir kay and leave him nigh dead upon the ground also he do a great battle with sir launcelot and there they depart on even hand and then sir launcelot make him knight dwarf say the lady i be glad of these tidings therefore go thou in an hermitage of mine hereby and there shalt thou bear with thee of my wine in two flagon of silver they be of two gallon and also two cast of bread with fat venison bake and dainty fowl and a cup of gold here i deliver thee that be rich and precious and bear all this to mine hermitage and put it in the hermit hand and sithen go thou unto my sister and greet her well and commend me unto that gentle knight and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong and say ye him i thank him of hi courtesy and goodness that he would take upon him such labour for me that never do him bounty nor courtesy also pray him that he be of good heart and courage for he shall meet with a full noble knight but he be neither of bounty courtesy nor gentleness for he attendeth unto nothing but to murder and that be the cause i can not praise him nor love him so this dwarf depart and come to sir persant where he find the damosel linet and sir beaumains and there he tell them all a ye have hear and then they take their leave but sir persant take an ambling hackney and convey them on their way and then beleft them to god and so within a little while they come to that hermitage and there they drink the wine and eat the venison and the fowl baken and so when they have repast them well the dwarf return again with hi vessel unto the castle again and there meet with him the red knight of the red launds and ask him from whence that he come and where he have be sir say the dwarf i have be with my ladys sister of this castle and she hath be at king arthur court and bring a knight with her then i account her travail but lose for though she have bring with her sir launcelot sir tristram sir lamorak or sir gawain i would think myself good enough for them all it may well be say the dwarf but this knight hath pass all the perilous passage and slay the black knight and other two more and win the green knight the red knight and the blue knight then be he one of these four that i have afore rehearse he be none of those say the dwarf but he be a king son what be hi name say the red knight of the red launds that will i not tell you say the dwarf but sir kay upon scorn name him beaumains i care not say the knight what knight so ever he be for i shall soon deliver him and if i ever match him he shall have a shameful death a many other have have that be pity say the dwarf and it be marvel that ye make such shameful war upon noble knight now leave we the knight and the dwarf and speak we of beaumains that all night lay in the hermitage and upon the morn he and the damosel linet hear their mass and brake their fast and then they take their horse and rode throughout a fair forest and then they come to a plain and saw where be many pavilion and tent and a fair castle and there be much smoke and great noise and when they come near the siege sir beaumains espy upon great tree a he ride how there hang full goodly arm knight by the neck and their shield about their neck with their sword and gilt spur upon their heel and so there hung nigh a forty knight shamefully with full rich arm then sir beaumains abate hi countenance and say what meaneth this fair sir say the damosel abate not your cheer for all this sight for ye must courage yourself or els ye be all shent for all these knight come hither to this siege to rescue my sister dame lioness and when the red knight of the red launds have overcome them he put them to this shameful death without mercy and pity and in the same wise he will serve you but if you quit you the good now jesu defend me say beaumains from such a villainous death and shenship of arm for rather than i should so be faren withal i would rather be slay manly in plain battle so be ye good say the damosel for trust not in him be no courtesy but all goeth to the death or shameful murder and that be pity for he be a full likely man well make of body and a full noble knight of prowess and a lord of great land and possession truly say beaumains he may well be a good knight but he useth shameful custom and it be marvel that he endureth so long that none of the noble knight of my lord arthur have not deal with him and then they ride to the dyke and saw them double dyke with full warlike wall and there be lodge many great lord nigh the wall and there be great noise of minstrelsy and the sea beat upon the one side of the wall where be many ship and mariner noise with hale and how and also there be fast by a sycamore tree and there hang an horn the great that ever they saw of an elephant bone and this knight of the red launds have hang it up there that if there come any errantknight he must blow that horn and then will he make him ready and come to him to do battle but sir i pray you say the damosel linet blow ye not the horn till it be high noon for now it be about prime and now increaseth hi might that a men say he hath seven men strength ah fie for shame fair damosel say ye never so more to me for an he be as good a knight a ever be i shall never fail him in hi most might for either i will win worship worship or die knightly in the field and therewith he spur hi horse straight to the sycamore tree and blow so the horn eagerly that all the siege and the castle rang thereof and then there leap out knight out of their tent and pavilion and they within the castle look over the wall and out at window then the red knight of the red launds arm him hastily and two baron set on hi spur upon hi heel and all be blood red hi armour spear and shield and an earl buckle hi helm upon hi head and then they bring him a red spear and a red steed and so he ride into a little vale under the castle that all that be in the castle and at the siege might behold the battle sir say the damosel linet unto sir beaumains look ye be glad and light for yonder be your deadly enemy and at yonder window be my lady my sister dame lioness where say beaumains yonder say the damosel and point with her finger that be truth say beaumains she beseemeth afar the fair lady that ever i look upon and truly he say i ask no good quarrel than now for to do battle for truly she shall be my lady and for her i will fight and ever he look up to the window with glad countenance and the lady lioness make curtsey to him down to the earth with hold up both their hand with that the red knight of the red launds call to sir beaumains leave sir knight thy look and behold me i counsel thee for i warn thee well she be my lady and for her i have do many strong battle if thou have so do say beaumains meseemeth it be but waste labour for she loveth none of thy fellowship and thou to love that loveth not thee be but great folly for an i understand that she be not glad of my come i would be advise or i do battle for her but i understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy fellowship and therefore wit thou well thou red knight of the red launds i love her and will rescue her or els to die sayst thou that say the red knight meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by yonder knight that thou sawest hang upon yonder tree fie for shame say beaumains that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil for in that thou shamest thyself and knighthood and thou mayst be sure there will no lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked custom and now thou weenest that the sight of these hang knight should fear me nay truly not so that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness against thee more than i would have have against thee an thou wert a wellruled knight make thee ready say the red knight of the red launds and talk no longer with me then sir beaumains bid the damosel go from him and then they put their spear in their rest and come together with all their might that they have both and either smote other in midst of their shield that the paitrelles surcingles and crupper brast and fell to the earth both and the rein of their bridle in their hand and so they lay a great while sore astonied that all that be in the castle and in the siege weened their neck have be break and then many a stranger and other say the strange knight be a big man and a noble jouster for or now we saw never no knight match the red knight of the red launds thus they say both within the castle and without then lightly they avoid their horse and put their shield afore them and draw their sword and run together like two fierce lion and either give other such buffet upon their helm that they reel backward both two stride and then they recover both and hew great piece off their harness and their shield that a great part fell into the field and then thus they fight till it be past noon and never would stint till at the last they lack wind both and then they stand wag and scatter pant blowing and bleeding that all that behold them for the most part wept for pity so when they have rest them a while they yede to battle again trace race foining a two boar and at some time they take their run a it have be two ram and hurtle together that sometime they fell grovel to the earth and at some time they be so amazed that either take other sword instead of hi own thus they endure till evensong time that there be none that behold them might know whether be like to win the battle and their armour be so forhewn that men might see their naked side and in other place they be naked but ever the naked place they do defend and the red knight be a wily knight of war and hi wily fight taught sir beaumains to be wise but he aby it full sore or he do espy hi fighting and thus by assent of them both they grant either other to rest and so they set them down upon two molehill there beside the fight place and either of them unlace hi helm and take the cold wind for either of their page be fast by them to come when they call to unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment and then when sir beaumains helm be off he look up to the window and there he saw the fair lady dame lioness and she make him such countenance that hi heart wax light and jolly and therewith he bid the red knight of the red launds make him ready and let u do the battle to the utterance i will well say the knight and then they lace up their helm and their page avoid and they step together and fought freshly but the red knight of the red launds await him and at an overthwart smote him within the hand that hi sword fell out of hi hand and yet he give him another buffet upon the helm that he fell grovel to the earth and the red knight fell over him for to hold him down then cry the maiden linet on high o sir beaumains where be thy courage become ala my lady my sister beholdeth thee and she sobbeth and weepeth that maketh mine heart heavy when sir beaumains hear her say so he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon hi foot and lightly he leap to hi sword and grip it in hi hand and double hi pace unto the red knight and there they fight a new battle together but sir beaumains then double hi stroke and smite so thick that he smite the sword out of hi hand and then he smite him upon the helm that he fell to the earth and sir beaumains fell upon him and unlace hi helm to have slay him and then he yield him and ask mercy and say with a loud voice o noble knight i yield me to thy mercy then sir beaumains bethink him upon the knight that he have make to be hang shamefully and then he say i may not with my worship save thy life for the shameful death that thou hast cause many full good knight to die sir say the red knight of the red launds hold your hand and ye shall know the cause why i put them to so shameful a death say on say sir beaumains sir i love once a lady a fair damosel and she have her brother slain and she say it be sir launcelot du lake or els sir gawain and she pray me a that i love her heartily that i would make her a promise by the faith of my knighthood for to labour daily in arm unto i meet with one of them and all that i might overcome i should put them unto a villainous death and this be the cause that i have put all these knight to death and so i ensure her to do all the villainy unto king arthur knight and that i should take vengeance upon all these knight and sir now i will thee tell that every day my strength increaseth till noon and all this time have i seven men strength then come there many earl and baron and noble knight and pray that knight to save hi life and take him to your prisoner and all they fell upon their knee and pray him of mercy and that he would save hi life and sir they all say it be fair of him to take homage and fealty and let him hold hi land of you than for to slay him by hi death ye shall have none advantage and hi misdeed that be do may not be undone and therefore he shall make amends to all party and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty fair lord say beaumains wit you well i be full loath to slay this knight nevertheless he hath do passing ill and shamefully but insomuch all that he do be at a ladys request i blame him the less and so for your sake i will release him that he shall have hi life upon this covenant that he go within the castle and yield him there to the lady and if she will forgive and quit him i will well with this he make her amends of all the trespass he hath do against her and her land and also when that be do that ye go unto the court of king arthur and there that ye ask sir launcelot mercy and sir gawain for the evil will ye have have against them sir say the red knight of the red launds all this will i do a ye command and siker assurance and borrow ye shall have and so then when the assurance be make he make hi homage and fealty and all those earl and baron with him and then the maiden linet come to sir beaumains and unarm him and search hi wound and stint hi blood and in likewise she do to the red knight of the red launds and there they sojourn ten day in their tent and the red knight make hi lord and servant to do all the pleasure that they might unto sir beaumains and so within a while the red knight of the red launds yede unto the castle and put him in her grace and so she receive him upon sufficient surety so all her hurt be well restore of all that she could complain and then he depart unto the court of king arthur and there openly the red knight of the red launds put him in the mercy of sir launcelot and sir gawain and there he tell openly how he be overcome and by whom and also he tell all the battle from the begin unto the endjesu mercy say king arthur and sir gawain we marvel much of what blood he be come for he be a noble knight have ye no marvel say sir launcelot for ye shall right well wit that he be come of a full noble blood and a for hi might and hardiness there be but few now live that be so mighty a he be and so noble of prowess it seemeth by you say king arthur that ye know hi name and from whence he be come and of what blood he be i suppose i do so say launcelot or els i would not have give him the order of knighthood but he give me such charge at that time that i should never discover him until he require me or els it be know openly by some other now turn we unto sir beaumains that desire of linet that he might see her sister hi lady sir she say i would fain ye saw her then sir beaumains all arm him and take hi horse and hi spear and rode straight unto the castle and when he come to the gate he find there many men arm and pull up the drawbridge and draw the port close then marvel he why they would not suffer him to enter and then he look up to the window and there he saw the fair lioness that say on high go thy way sir beaumains for as yet thou shalt not have wholly my love unto the time that thou be call one of the number of the worthy knight and therefore go labour in worship this twelvemonth and then thou shalt hear new tidings ala fair lady say beaumains i have not deserve that ye should show me this strangeness and i have weened that i should have right good

but to my death i shall love you and none other and therewithal she turn her from the window and sir beaumains ride awayward from the castle make great dole and so he ride here and there and wist not where he ride till it be dark night and then it happen him to come to a poor man house and there he be harbour all that night but sir beaumains have no rest but wallow and writhe for the love of the lady of the castle and so upon the morrow he take hi horse and rode until underne and then he come to a broad water and thereby be a great lodge and there he alight to sleep and lay hi head upon the shield and betook hi horse to the dwarf and command him to watch all night now turn we to the lady of the same castle that think much upon beaumains and then she call unto her sir gringamore her

that be my joy then say sir gawain and hi brother unto arthur sir an ye will give u leave we will go and seek our brother nay say sir launcelot that shall ye not need and so say sir baudwin of britain for as by our advice the king shall send unto dame lioness a messenger and pray her that she will come to the court in all the haste that she may and doubt ye not she will come and then she may give

that shall be do before my castle at the assumption of our lady and the cry shall be this that you my lord arthur shall be there and your knight and i will purvey that my knight shall be against yours
