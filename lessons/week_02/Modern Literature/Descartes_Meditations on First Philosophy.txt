it be now some year since i detect how many be the false belief that i have from my early youth admit a true and how doubtful be everything i have since construct on this basis and from that time i be convince that i must once for all seriously undertake to rid myself of all the opinion which i have formerly accept and commence to build anew from the foundation if i want to establish any firm and permanent structure in the science but a this enterprise appear to be a very great one i wait until i have attain an age so mature that i could not hope that at any late date i should be well fit to execute my design this reason cause me to delay so long that i should feel that i be do wrong be i to occupy in deliberation the time that yet remain to me for action today then since very opportunely for the plan i have in view i have deliver my mind from every care and be happily agitate by no passion and since i have procure for myself an assured leisure in a peaceable retirement i shall at last seriously and freely address myself to the general upheaval of all my former opinion now for this object it be not necessary that i should show that all of these be false shall perhaps never arrive at this end but inasmuch a reason already persuade me that i ought no less carefully to withhold my assent from matter which be not entirely certain and indubitable than from those which appear to me manifestly to be false if i be able to find in each one some reason to doubt this will suffice to justify my reject the whole and for that end it will not be requisite that i should examine each in particular which would be an endless undertaking for owe to the fact that the destruction of the foundation of necessity brings with it the downfall of the rest of the edifice i shall only in the first place attack those principle upon which all my former opinion rest all that up to the present time i have accept a most true and certain i have learn either from the sens or through the sens but it be sometimes prove to me that these sens be deceptive and it be wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once be deceive but it may be that although the sens sometimes deceive u concern thing which be hardly perceptible or very far away there be yet many other to be meet with a to which we can not reasonably have any doubt although we recognise them by their mean for example there be the fact that i be here seat by the fire attire in a dress gown have this paper in my hand and other similar matter and how could i deny that these hand and this body be mine be it not perhaps that i compare myself to certain person devoid of sense whose cerebellum be so troubled and cloud by the violent vapour of black bile that they constantly assure u that they think they be king when they be really quite poor or that they be clothe in purple when they be really without cover or who imagine that they have an earthenware head or be nothing but pumpkin or be make of glass but they be mad and i should not be any the less insane be i to follow example so extravagant at the same time i must remember that i be a man and that consequently i be in the habit of sleep and in my dream represent to myself the same thing or sometimes even less probable thing than do those who be insane in their waking moment how often have it happen to me that in the night i dream that i find myself in this particular place that i be dress and seat near the fire whilst in reality i be lie undressed in bed at this moment it do indeed seem to me that it be with eye awake that i be look at this paper that this head which i move be not asleep that it be deliberately and of set purpose that i extend my hand and perceive it what happen in sleep do not appear so clear nor so distinct a do all this but in thinking over this i remind myself that on many occasion i have in sleep be deceive by similar illusion and in dwell carefully on this reflection i see so manifestly that there be no certain indication by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that i be lose in astonishment and my astonishment be such that it be almost capable of persuade me that i now dream now let u assume that we be asleep and that all these particular eg that we open our eye shake our head extend our hand and so on be but false delusion and let u reflect that possibly neither our hand nor our whole body be such a they appear to u to be at the same time we must at least confess that the thing which be represent to u in sleep be like paint representation which can only have be form a the counterpart of something real and true and that in this way those general thing at least ie eye a head hand and a whole body be not imaginary thing but thing really existent for a a matter of fact painter even when they study with the great skill to represent siren and satyr by form the most strange and extraordinary can not give them naturewhich be entirely new but merely make a certain medley of the member of different animal or if their imagination be extravagant enough to invent something so novel that nothing similar have ever before be see and that then their work represent a thing purely fictitious and absolutely false it be certain all the same that the colour of which this be compose be necessarily real and for the same reason although these general thing to with a body eye a head hand and such like may be imaginary we be bind at the same time to confess that there be at least some other object yet more simple and more universal which be real and true and of these just in the same way a with certain real colour all these image of thing which dwell in our thought whether true and real or false and fantastic be form to such a class of thing pertains corporeal naturein general and it extension the figure of extended thing their quantity or magnitude and number a also the place in which they be the time which measure their duration and so on that be possibly why our reasoning be not unjust when we conclude from this that physic astronomy medicine and all other science which have a their end the consideration of composite thing be very dubious and uncertain but that arithmetic geometry and other science of that kind which only treat of thing that be very simple and very general without take great trouble to ascertain whether they be actually existent or not contain some measure of certainty and an element of the indubitable for whether i be awake or asleep two and three together always form five and the square can never have more than four side and it do not seem possible that truth so clear and apparent can be suspect of any falsity or uncertainty nevertheless i have long have fix in my mind the belief that an allpowerful god exist by whom i have be create such a i be but how do i know that he have not bring it to pass that there be no earth no heaven no extended body no magnitude no place and that nevertheless i possess the perception of all these thing and that they seem to me to exist just exactly a i now see them and besides a i sometimes imagine that other deceive themselves in the thing which they think they know best how do i know that i be not deceive every time that i add two and three or count the side of a square or judge of thing yet simpler if anything simpler can be imagine but possibly god have not desire that i should be thus deceive for he be say to be supremely good if however it be contrary to hi goodness to have make me such that i constantly deceive myself it would also appear to be contrary to hi goodness to permit me to be sometimes deceive and nevertheless i can not doubt that he do permit this there may indeed be those who would prefer to deny the existence of a god so powerful rather than believe that all other thing be uncertain but let u not oppose them for the present and grant that all that be here say of a god be a fable nevertheless in whatever way they suppose that i have arrive at the state of be that i have reach hether they attribute it to fate or to accident or make out that it be by a continual succession of antecedent or by some other method inc to err and deceive oneself be a defect it be clear that the great will be the probability of my be so imperfect a to deceive myself ever a be the author to whom they assign my origin the less powerful to these reason i have certainly nothing to reply but at the end i feel constrain to confess that there be nothing in all that i formerly believe to be true of which i can not in some measure doubt and that not merely through want of thought or through levity but for reason which be very powerful and maturely consider so that henceforth i ought not the less carefully to refrain from give credence to these opinion than to that which be manifestly false if i desire to arrive at any certainty in the science but it be not sufficient to have make these remark we must also be careful to keep them in mind for these ancient and commonly hold opinion still revert frequently to my mind long and familiar custom have give them the right to occupy my mind against my inclination and render them almost master of my belief nor will i ever lose the habit of defer to them or of place my confidence in them so long a i consider them a they really be ie opinion in some measure doubtful a i have just show and at the same time highly probable so that there be much more reason to believe in than to deny them that be why i consider that i shall not be act amiss if take of set purpose a contrary belief i allow myself to be deceive and for a certain time pretend that all these opinion be entirely false and imaginary until at last have thus balance my former prejudice with my latter so that they can not divert my opinion more to one side than to the other my judgment will no longer be dominate by bad usage or turn away from the right knowledge of the truth for i be assure that there can be neither peril nor error in this course and that i can not at present yield too much to distrust since i be not consider the question of action but only of knowledge i shall then suppose not that god who be supremely good and the fountain of truth but some evil genius not less powerful than deceitful have employ hi whole energy in deceive me i shall consider that the heaven the earth colour figure sound and all other external thing be nought but the illusion and dream of which this genius have avail himself in order to lay trap for my credulity i shall consider myself a have no hand no eyes no flesh no blood nor any sens yet falsely believe myself to possess all these thing i shall remain obstinately attach to this idea and if by this mean it be not in my power to arrive at the knowledge of any truth i may at least do what be in my power ie suspend my judgment and with firm purpose avoid give credence to any false thing or be impose upon by this arch deceiver however powerful and deceptive he may be but this task be a laborious one and insensibly a certain lassitude lead me into the course of my ordinary life and just a a captive who in sleep enjoy an imaginary liberty when he begin to suspect that hi liberty be but a dream fear to awaken and conspires with these agreeable illusion that the deception may be prolong so insensibly of my own accord i fall back into my former opinion and i dread awaken from this slumber l the laborious wakefulness which would follow the tranquillity of this repose should have to be spend not in daylight but in the excessive darkness of the difficulty which have just be discuss the meditation of yesterday fill my mind with so many doubt that it be no longer in my power to forget them and yet i do not see in what manner i can resolve them and just a if i have all of a sudden fallen into very deep water i be so disconcerted that i can neither make certain of set my foot on the bottom nor can i swim and so support myself on the surface i shall nevertheless make an effort and follow anew the same path a that on which i yesterday enter ie i shall proceed by set aside all that in which the least doubt could be suppose to exist just a if i have discover that it be absolutely false and i shall ever follow in this road until i have meet with something which be certain or at least if i can do nothing els until i have learn for certain that there be nothing in the world that be certain archimedes in order that he might draw the terrestrial globe out of it place and transport it elsewhere demand only that one point should be fix and immoveable in the same way i shall have the right to conceive high hope if i be happy enough to discover one thing only which be certain and indubitable i suppose then that all the thing that i see be false i persuade myself that nothing have ever exist of all that my fallacious memory represent to me i consider that i possess no sens i imagine that body figure extension movement and place be but the fiction of my mind what then can be esteem a true perhaps nothing at all unless that there be nothing in the world that be certain but how can i know there be not something different from those thing that i have just consider of which one can not have the slight doubt be there not some god or some other be by whatever name we call it who put these reflection into my mind that be not necessary for be it not possible that i be capable of produce them myself i myself be i not at least something but i have already deny that i have sens and body yet i hesitate for what follow from that am i so dependent on body and sense that i can not exist without these but i be persuade that there be nothing in all the world that there be no heaven no earth that there be no mind nor any body be i not then likewise persuade that i do not exist not at all of a surety i myself do exist since i persuade myself of something or merely because i think of something but there be some deceiver or other very powerful and very cunning who ever employ hi ingenuity in deceive me then without doubt i exist also if he deceive me and let him deceive me as much a he will he can never cause me to be nothing so long a i think that i be something so that after have reflect well and carefully examine all thing we must come to the definite conclusion that this proposition i be i exist be necessarily true each time that i pronounce it or that i mentally conceive it but i do not yet know clearly enough what i be i who be certain that i be and hence i must be careful to see that i do not imprudently take some other object in place of myself and thus that i do not go astray in respect of this knowledge that i hold to be the most certain and most evident of all that i have formerly learn that be why i shall now consider anew what i believe myself to be before i embark upon these last reflection and of my former opinion i shall withdraw all that might even in a small degree be invalidate by the reason which i have just bring forward in order that there may be nothing at all leave beyond what be absolutely certain and indubitable what then do i formerly believe myself to be undoubtedly i believe myself to be a man but what be a man shall i say a reasonable animal certainly not for then i should have to inquire what an animal be and what be reasonable and thus from a single question i should insensibly fall into an infinitude of other more difficult and i should not wish to waste the little time and leisure remain to me in try to unravel subtlety like these but i shall rather stop here to consider the thought which of themselves spring up in my mind and which be not inspire by anything beyond my own naturealone when i apply myself to the consideration of my be in the first place the i consider myself a have a face hand arm and all that system of member compose on bone and flesh a see in a corpse which i designate by the name of body in addition to this i consider that i be nourish that i walk that i felt and that i think and i refer all these action to the soul but i do not stop to consider what the soul be or if i do stop i imagine that it be something extremely rare and subtle like a wind a flame or an ether which be spread throughout my grosser part a to body i have no manner of doubt about it naturebut think i have a very clear knowledge of it and if i have desire to explain it accord to the notion that i have then form of it i should have describe it thus by the body i understand all that which can be define by a certain figure something which can be confine in a certain place and which can fill a give space in such a way that every other body will be exclude from it which can be perceive either by tough or by sight or by hear or by taste or by smell which can be move in many way not in truth by itself but by something which be foreign to it by which it be touch and from which it receive impression for to have the power of selfmovement a also of feel or of think i do not consider to appertain to the natureof body on the contrary i be rather astonish to find that faculty similar to them exist in some body but what be i now that i suppose that there be a certain genius which be extremely powerful and if i may say so malicious who employ all hi power in deceive me can i affirm that i possess the least of all those thing which i have just say pertain to the natureof body i pause to consider i revolve all these thing in my mind and i find none of which i can say that it pertain to me it would be tedious to stop to enumerate them let u pass to the attribute of soul and see if there be any one which be in me what of nutrition or walk the first mention but if it be so that i have no body it be also true that i can neither walk nor take nourishment another attribute be sensation but one can not feel without body and besides i have think i perceive many thing during sleep that i recognise in my waking moment a not have be experience at all what of think i find here that thought be an attribute that belong to me it alone can not be separate from me i be i exist that be certain but how often just when i think for it might possibly be the case if i cease entirely to think that i should likewise cease altogether to exist i do not now admit anything which be not necessarily true to speak accurately i be not more than a thing which think that be to say a mind or a soul or an understanding or a reason which be term whose significance be formerly unknown to me i be however a real thing and really exist but what thing i have answer a thing which think and what more i shall exercise my imagination in order to see if i be not something more i be not a collection of member which we call the human body i be not a subtle air distribute through these member i be not a wind a fire a vapour a breath nor anything at all which i can imagine or conceive because i have assume that all these be nothing without change that supposition i find that i only leave myself certain of the fact that i be somewhat but perhaps it be true that these same thing which i suppose be nonexistent because they be unknown to me be really not different from the self which i know i be not sure about this i shall not dispute about it now i can only give judgment on thing that be know to me i know that i exist and i inquire what i be i whom i know to exist but it be very certain that the knowledge of my existence take in it precise significance do not depend on thing whose existence be not yet know to me consequently it do not depend on those which i can feign in imagination and indeed the very term feign in imagination prof to me my error for i really do this if i image myself a something since to imagine be nothing els than to contemplate the figure or image of a corporeal thing but i already know for certain that i be and that it may be that all these image and speak generally all thing that relate to the natureof body be nothing but dream and chimera for this reason i see clearly that i have as little reason to say i shall stimulate my imagination in order to know more distinctly what i be than if i be to say i be now awake and i perceive somewhat that be real and true but because i do not yet perceive it distinctly enough i shall go to sleep of express purpose so that my dream may represent the perception with great truth and evidence and thus i know for certain that nothing of all that i can understand by mean of my imagination belong to this knowledge which i have of myself and that it be necessary to recall the mind from this mode of thought with the utmost diligence in order that it may be able to know it own naturewith perfect distinctness but what then be i a thing which think what be a thing which think it be a thing which doubt understand conceives affirms denies will refuse which also imago and feel certainly it be no small matter if all these thing pertain to my naturebut why should they not so pertain am i not that be who now doubt nearly everything who nevertheless understand certain thing who affirm that one only be true who deny all the other who desire to know more be averse from be deceive who imagine many thing sometimes indeed despite hi will and who perceive many likewise a by the intervention of the bodily organ be there nothing in all this which be as true a it be certain that i exist even though i should always sleep and though he who have give me be employ all hi ingenuity in deceive me be there likewise any one of these attribute which can be distinguish from my thought or which might be say to be separate from myself for it be so evident of itself that it be i who doubt who understand and who desire that there be no reason here to add anything to explain it and i have certainly the power of imagine likewise for although it may happen a i formerly suppose that none of the thing which i imagine be true nevertheless this power of imagining do not cease to be really in use and it form part of my thought finally i be the same who feel that be to say who perceive certain thing a by the organ of sense since it truth i see light i hear noise i feel heat but it will be say that these phenomenon be false and that i be dream let it be so still it be at least quite certain that it seem to me that i see light that i hear noise and that i feel heat that can not be false properly speak it be what be in me call feeling and use in this precise sense that be no other thing than think from this time i begin to know what i be with a little more clearness and distinction than before but nevertheless it still seem to me and i can not prevent myself from think that corporeal thing whose image be frame by thought which be test by the sens be much more distinctly know than that obscure part of me which do not come under the imagination although really it be very strange to say that i know and understand more distinctly these thing whose existence seem to me dubious which be unknown to me and which do not belong to me than other of the truth of which i be convince which be know to me and which pertain to my real naturein a word than myself but i see clearly how the case stand my mind love to wander and can not yet suffer itself to be retain within the just limit of truth very good let u once more give it the free rein so that when afterwards we seize the proper occasion for pull up it may the more easily be regulate and control let u begin by consider the common matter those which we believe to be the most distinctly comprehend to wit the body which we touch and see not indeed body in general for these general idea be usually a little more confused but let u consider one body in particular let u take for example this piece of wax it have be take quite freshly from the hive and it have not yet lose the sweetness of the honey which it contain it still retain somewhat of the odour of the flower from which it have be cull it colour it figure it size be apparent it be hard cold easily handle and if you strike it with the finger it will emit a sound finally all the thing which be requisite to cause u distinctly to recognise a body be meet with in it but notice that while i speak and approach the fire what remain of the taste be exhale the smell evaporate the colour alter the figure be destroy the size increase it become liquid it heat scarcely can one handle it and when one strike it now sound be emit doe the same wax remain after this change we must confess that it remain none would judge otherwise what then do i know so distinctly in this piece of wax it could certainly be nothing of all that the sens bring to my notice since all these thing which fall under taste smell sight touch and hearing be find to be change and yet the same wax remain perhaps it be what i now think viz that this wax be not that sweetness of honey nor that agreeable scent of flower nor that particular whiteness nor that figure nor that sound but simply a body which a little while before appeared tome a perceptible under these form and which be now perceptible under other but what precisely be it that i imagine when i form such conception let u attentively consider this and abstract from all that do not belong to the wax let u see what remain certainly nothing remain except a certain extended thing which be flexible and movable but what be the meaning of flexible and movable be it not that i imagine that this piece of wax be round be capable of become square and of pass from a square to a triangular figure no certainly it be not that since i imagine it admit of an infinitude of similar change and i nevertheless do not know how to compass the infinitude by my imagination and consequently this conception which i have of the wax be not bring about by the faculty of imagination what now be this extension be it not also unknown for it become great when the wax be melt great when it be boil and great still when the heat increase and i should not conceive clearly accord to truth what wax be if i do not think that even this piece that we be consider be capable of receive more variation in extension than i have ever imagine we must then grant that i could not even understand through the imagination what this piece of wax be and that it be my mind alone which perceive it i say this piece of wax in particular for a to wax in general it be yet clear but what be this piece of wax which can not be understood excepting by the understanding or mind it be certainly the same that i see touch imagine and finally it be the same which i have always believe it to be from the beginning but what must particularly be observe be that it perception be neither an act of vision nor of touch nor of imagination and have never be such although it may have appear formerly to be so but only an intuition of the mind which may be imperfect and confuse a it be formerly or clear and distinct a it be at present accord a my attention be more or less direct to the element which be find in it and of which it be compose yet in the meantime i be greatly astonish when i consider the great feebleness of mind and it proneness to fall insensibly into error for although without give expression to my thought i consider all this in my own mind word often impede me and i be almost deceive by the term of ordinary language for we say that we see the same wax if it be present and not that we simply judge that it be the same from it have the same colour and figure from this i should conclude that i know the wax by mean of vision and not simply by the intuition of the mind unless by chance i remember that when look from a window and say i see men who pass in the street i really do not see them but infer that what i see be men just a i say that i see wax and yet what do i see from the window but hat and coat which may cover automatic machine yet i judge these to be men and similarly solely by the faculty of judgment which rest in my mind i comprehend that which i believe i saw with my eye a man who make it hi aim to raise hi knowledge above the common should be ashamed to derive the occasion for doubt from the form of speech invent by the vulgar i prefer to pass on and consider whether i have a more evident and perfect conception of what the wax be when i first perceive it and when i believe i know it by mean of the external sens or at least by the common sense a it be call that be to say by the imaginative faculty or whether my present conception be clear now that i have most carefully examine what it be and in what way it can be know it would certainly be absurd to doubt a to this for what be there in this first perception which be distinct what be there which might not as well have be perceive by any of the animal but when i distinguish the wax from it external form and when just a if i have take from it it vestment i consider it quite naked it be certain that although some error may still be find in my judgment i can nevertheless not perceive it thus without a human mind but finally what shall i say of this mind that be of myself for up to this point i do not admit in myself anything but mind what then i who seem to perceive this piece of wax so distinctly do i not know myself not only with much more truth and certainty but also with much more distinctness and clearness for if i judge that the wax be or exist from the fact that i see it it certainly follow much more clearly that i be or that i exist myself from the fact that i see it for it may be that what i see be not really wax it may also be that i do not possess eye with which to see anything but it can not be that when i see or for i no longer take account of the distinction when i think i see that i myself who think be nought so if i judge that the wax exist from the fact that i touch it the same thing will follow to wit that i be and if i judge that my imagination or some other cause whatever it be persuades me that the wax exist i shall still conclude the same and what i have here remark of wax may be apply to all other thing which be external to me and which be meet with outside of me and far if the notion or perception of wax have seem to me clear and more distinct not only after the sight or the touch but also after many other cause have render it quite manifest to me with how much more evidence and distinctness must it be say that i now know myself since all the reason which contribute to the knowledge of wax or any other body whatever be yet good proof of the natureof my mind and there be so many other thing in the mind itself which may contribute to the elucidation of it naturethat those which depend on body such a these just mention hardly merit be take into account but finally here i be have insensibly revert to the point i desire for since it be now manifest to me that even body be not properly speak know by the sens or by the faculty of imagination but by the understand only and since they be not know from the fact that they be see or touch but only because they be understood i see clearly that there be nothing which be easy for me to know than my mind but because it be difficult to rid oneself so promptly of an opinion to which one be accustom for so long it will be well that i should halt a little at this point so that by the length of my meditation i may more deeply imprint on my memory this new knowledge i shall now close my eye i shall stop my ear i shall call away all my sens i shall efface even from my thought all the image of corporeal thing or at least for that be hardly possible i shall esteem them a vain and false and thus hold converse only with myself and consider my own naturei shall try little by little to reach a good knowledge of and a more familiar acquaintanceship with myself i be a thing that think that be to say that doubt affirms denies that know a few thing that be ignorant of many that love that hat that will that desire that also imago and perceives for a i remark before although the thing which i perceive and imagine be perhaps nothing at all apart from me and in themselves i be nevertheless assure that these mode of thought that i call perception and imagination inasmuch only a they be mode of thought certainly reside and be meet with in me and in the little that i have just say i think i have sum up all that i really know or at least all that hitherto i be aware that i know in order to try to extend my knowledge far i shall now look around more carefully and see whether i can not still discover in myself some other thing which i have not hitherto perceive i be certain that i be a thing which think but do i not then likewise know what be requisite to render me certain of a truth certainly in this first knowledge there be nothing that assure me of it truth except the clear and distinct perception of that which i state which would not indeed suffice to assure me that what i say be true if it could ever happen that a thing which i conceive so clearly and distinctly could be false and accordingly it seem to me that already i can establish a a general rule that all thing which i perceive very clearly and very distinctly be true at the same time i have before receive and admit many thing to be very certain and manifest which yet i afterwards recognise a be dubious what then be these thing they be the earth sky star and all other object which i apprehend by mean of the sens but what do i clearly and distinctly perceive in them nothing more than that the idea or thought of these thing be present to my mind and not even now do i deny that these idea be meet with in me but there be yet another thing which i affirm and which owe to the habit which i have form of believe it i think i perceive very clearly although in truth i do not perceive it at all to wit that there be object outside of me from which these idea proceed and to which they be entirely similar and it be in this that i err or if perchance my judgment be correct this be not due to any knowledge arising from my perception but when i take anything very simple and easy in the sphere of arithmetic or geometry into consideration eg that two and three together make five and other thing of the sort be not these present to my mind so clearly a to enable me to affirm that they be true certainly if i judge that since such matter could be doubt this would not have be so for any other reason than that it come into my mind that perhaps a god might have endow me with such a naturethat i may have be deceive even concern thing which seem to me most manifest but every time that this preconceived opinion of the sovereign power of a god present itself to my thought i be constrain to confess that it be easy to him if he wish it to cause me to err even in matter in which i believe myself to have the best evidence and on the other hand always when i direct my attention to thing which i believe myself to perceive very clearly i be so persuaded of their truth that i let myself break out into word such a these let who will deceive me he can never cause me to be nothing while i think that i be or some day cause it to be true to say that i have never be it be true now to say that i be or that two and three make more or less than five or any such thing in which i see a manifest contradiction and certainly since i have no reason to believe that there be a god who be a deceiver and a i have not yet satisfy myself that there be a god at all the reason for doubt which depend on this opinion alone be very slight and so to speak metaphysical but in order to be able altogether to remove it i must inquire whether there be a god as soon a the occasion present itself and if i find that there be a god i must also inquire whether he may be a deceiver for without a knowledge of these two truth i do not see that i can ever be certain of anything and in order that i may have an opportunity of inquire into this in an orderly way without interrupt the order of meditation which i have propose to myself and which be little by little to pass from the notion which i find first of all in my mind to those which i shall later on discover in it it be requisite that i should here divide my thought into certain kind and that i should consider in which of these kind there be properly speak truth or error to be find of my thought some be so to speak image of the thing and to these alone be the title idea properly apply example be my thought of a man or of a chimera of heaven of an angel or even of god but other thought posse other form a well for example in willing fear approve deny though i always perceive something a the subject of the action of my mind yet by this action i always add something els to the idea which i have of that thing and of the thought of this kind some be call volition or affection and other judgment now a to what concern idea if we consider them only in themselves and do not relate them to anything els beyond themselves they can not properly speak be false for whether i imagine a goat or a chimera it be not less true that i imagine the one that the other we must not fear likewise that falsity can enter into will and into affection for although i may desire evil thing or even thing that never exist it be not the less true that i desire them thus there remain no more than the judgment which we make in which i must take the great care not to deceive myself but the principal error and the common which we may meet with in them consist in my judging that the idea which be in me be similar or conformable to the thing which be outside me for without doubt if i consider the idea only a certain mode of my thought without try to relate them to anything beyond they could scarcely give me material for error but among these idea some appear to me to be innate some adventitious and other to be form or invent by myself for a i have the power of understand what be call a thing or a truth or a thought it appear to me that i hold this power from no other source than my own naturebut if i now hear some sound if i see the sun or feel heat i have hitherto judge that these sensation proceed from certain thing that exist outside of me and finally it appear to me that sirens hippogryphs and the like be form out of my own mind but again i may possibly persuade myself that all these idea be of the natureof those which i term adventitious or els that they be all innate or all fictitious for i have not yet clearly discover their true origin and my principal task in this place be to consider in respect to those idea which appear to me to proceed from certain object that be outside me what be the reason which cause me to think them similar to these object it seem indeed in the first place that i be taught this lesson by natureand secondly i experience in myself that these idea do not depend on my will nor therefore on myself or they often present themselves to my mind in spite of my will just now for instance whether i will or whether i do not will i feel heat and thus i persuade myself that this feeling or at least this idea of heat be produce in me by something which be different from me ie by the heat of the fire near which i sit and nothing seem to me more obvious than to judge that this object imprint it likeness rather than anything els upon me now i must discover whether these proof be sufficiently strong and convince when i say that i be so instruct by naturei merely mean a certain spontaneous inclination which impel me to believe in this connection and not a natural light which make me recognise that it be true but these two thing be very different for i can not doubt that which the natural light cause me to believe to be true a for example it have show me that i be from the fact that i doubt or other fact of the same kind and i possess no other faculty whereby to distinguish truth from falsehood which can teach me that what this light show me to be true be not really true and no other faculty that be equally trustworthy but as far a apparently natural impulse be concern i have frequently remark when i have to make active choice between virtue and vice that they often enough lead me to the part that be bad and this be why i do not see any reason for follow them in what regard truth and error and a to the other reason which be that these idea must proceed from object outside me since they do not depend on my will i do not find it any the more convincing for just a these impulse of which i have speak be find in me notwithstanding that they do not always concur with my will so perhaps there be in me some faculty fit to produce these idea without the assistance of any external thing even though it be not yet know by me just as apparently they have hitherto always be find in me during sleep without the aid of any external object and finally though they do proceed from object different from myself it be not a necessary consequence that they should resemble these on the contrary i have notice that in many case there be a great difference between the object and it idea i find for example two completely diverse idea of the sun in my mind the one derive it origin from the sens and should be place in the category of adventitious idea accord to this idea the sun seem to be extremely small but the other be derive from astronomical reasoning ie be elicit from certain notion that be innate in me or els it be form by me in some other manner in accordance with it the sun appear to be several time great than the earth these two idea can not indeed both resemble the same sun and reason make me believe that the one which seem to have originate directly from the sun itself be the one which be most dissimilar to it all this cause me to believe that until the present time it have not be by a judgment that be certain or premeditate but only by a sort of blind impulse that i believe that thing exist outside of and different from me which by the organ of my sens or by some other method whatever it might be convey these idea or image to me and imprint on me their similitude but there be yet another method of inquire whether any of the object of which i have idea within me exist outside of me if idea be only take a certain mode of thought i recognise amongst them no difference or inequality and all appear to proceed from me in the same manner but when we consider them a image one represent one thing and the other another it be clear that they be very different one from the other there be no doubt that those which represent to me substance be something more and contain so to speak more objective reality within them that be to say by representation participate in a high degree of be or perfection than those that simply represent mode or accident and that idea again by which i understand a supreme god eternal infinite immutable omniscient omnipotent and creator of all thing which be outside of himself have certainly more objective reality in itself than those idea by which finite substance be represent now it be manifest by the natural light that there must at least be as much reality in the efficient and total cause a in it effect for pray whence can the effect derive it reality if not from it cause and in what way can this cause communicate this reality to it unless it possess it in itself and from this it follow not only that something can not proceed from nothing but likewise that what be more perfect hat be to say which have more reality within itself can not proceed from the less perfect and this be not only evidently true of those effect which possess actual or formal reality but also of the idea in which we consider merely what be term objective reality to take an example the stone which have not yet exist not only can not now commence to be unless it have be produce by something which possess within itself either formally or eminently all that enters into the composition of the stone ie it must possess the same thing or other more excellent thing than those which exist in the stone and heat can only be produce in a subject in which it do not previously exist by a cause that be of an order degree or kind at least as perfect a heat and so in all other case but further the idea of heat or of a stone can not exist in me unless it have be place within me by some cause which possess within it at least as much reality a that which i conceive to exist in the heat or the stone for although this cause do not transmit anything of it actual or formal reality to my idea we must not for that reason imagine that it be necessarily a less real cause we must remember that since every idea be a work of the mind it naturebe such that it demand of itself no other formal reality than that which it borrow from my thought of which it be only a mode ie a manner or way of think but in order that an idea should contain some one certain objective reality rather than another it must without doubt derive it from some cause in which there be at least as much formal reality a this idea contain of objective reality for if we imagine that something be find in an idea which be not find in the cause it must then have be derive from nought but however imperfect may be this mode of be by which a thing be objectively or by representation in the understanding by it idea we can not certainly say that this mode of be be nothing nor consequently that the idea derive it origin from nothing nor must i imagine that since the reality that i consider in these idea be only objective it be not essential that this reality should be formally in the cause of my idea but that it be sufficient that it should be find objectively for just a this mode of objective existence pertains to idea by their proper natureso do the mode of formal existence pertain tot he cause of those idea this be at least true of the first and principal by the naturepeculiar to them and although it may be the case that one idea give birth to another idea that can not continue to be so indefinitely for in the end we must reach an idea whose cause shall be so to speak an archetype in which the whole reality or perfection which be so to speak objectively or by representation in these idea be contain formally and really thus the light of naturecause me to know clearly that the idea in me be like picture or image which can in truth easily fall short of the perfection of the object from which they have be derive but which can never contain anything great or more perfect and the long and the more carefully that i investigate these matter the more clearly and distinctly do i recognize their truth but what be i to conclude from it all in the end it be this that if the objective reality of any one of my idea be of such a naturea clearly to make me recognize that it be not in me either formally or eminently and that consequently i can not myself be the cause of it it follow of necessity that i be not alone in the world but that there be another be which exist or which be the cause of this idea on the other hand have no such an idea exist in me i should have have no sufficient argument to convince me of the existence of any be beyond myself for i have make very careful investigation everywhere and up to the present time have be able to find no other ground but of my idea beyond that which represent me to myself a to which there can here be no difficulty there be another which represent a god and there be other represent corporeal and inanimate thing other angels other animal and other again which represent to me men similar to myself a regard the idea which represent to me other men or animal or angel i can however easily conceive that they might be form by an admixture of the other idea which i have of myself of corporeal thing and of god even although there be apart from me neither men nor animal nor angel in all the world and in regard to the idea of corporeal object i do not recognise in them anything so great or so excellent that they might not have possibly proceed from myself for if i consider them more closely and examine them individually a i yesterday examine the idea of wax i find that there be very little in them which i perceive clearly and distinctly magnitude or extension in length breadth or depth i do so perceive also figure which result from a termination of this extension the situation which body of different figure preserve in relation to one another and movement or change of situation to which we may also add substance duration and number a to other thing such a light colour sound scent taste heat cold and the other tactile quality they be think by me with so much obscurity and confusion that i do not even know if they be true or false ie whether the idea which i form of these quality be actually the idea of real object or not or whether they only represent chimera which can not exist in fact for although i have before remark that it be only in judgment that falsity properly speak or formal falsity can be meet with a certain material falsity may nevertheless be find in idea ie when these idea represent what be nothing a though it be something for example the idea which i have of cold and heat be so far from clear and distinct that by their mean i can not tell whether cold be merely a privation of heat or heat a privation of cold or whether both be real quality or be not such and inasmuch a since idea resemble image there can not be any idea which do not appear to represent some thing if it be correct to say that cold be merely a privation of heat the idea which represent it to me a something real and positive will not be improperly term false and the same hold good of other similar idea to these it be certainly not necessary that i should attribute any author other than myself for if they be false ie if they represent thing which do not exist the light of natureshow me that they issue from nought that be to say that they be only in me so far a something be lack to the perfection of my naturebut if they be true nevertheless because they exhibit so little reality to me that i can not even clearly distinguish the thing represent from nonbeing i do not see any reason why they should not be produce by myself a to the clear and distinct idea which i have of corporeal thing some of them seem a though i might have derive them from the idea which i posse of myself a those which i have of substance duration number and such like for even when i think that a stone be a substance or at least a thing capable of exist of itself and that i be a substance also although i conceive that i be a thing that think and not one that be extend and that the stone on the other hand be an extended thing which do not think and that thus there be a notable difference between the two conception hey seem nevertheless to agree in this that both represent substance in the same way when i perceive that i now exist and far recollect that i have in former time exist and when i remember that i have various thought of which i can recognise the number i acquire idea of duration and number which i can afterwards transfer to any object that i please but a to all the other quality of which the idea of corporeal thing be compose to wit extension figure situation and motion it be true that they be not formally in me since i be only a thing that think but because they be merely certain mode of substance and so to speak the vestment under which corporeal substance appear to u and because i myself be also a substance it would seem that they might be contain in me eminently hence there remain only the idea of god concern which we must consider whether it be something which can not have proceed from me myself by the name god i understand a substance that be infinite eternal immutable independent allknowing allpowerful and by which i myself and everything els if anything els do exist have be create now all these characteristic be such that the more diligently i attend to them the less do they appear capable of proceed from me alone hence from what have be already say we must conclude that god necessarily exist for although the idea of substance be within me owe to the fact that i be substance nevertheless i should not have the idea of an infinite substance since i be finite if it have not proceed from some substance which be veritably infinite nor should i imagine that i do not perceive the infinite by a true idea but only by the negation of the finite just a i perceive repose and darkness by the negation of movement and of light for on the contrary i see that there be manifestly more reality in infinite substance than in finite and therefore that in some way i have in me the notion of the infinite earlier then the finite to wit the notion of god before that of myself for how would it be possible that i should know that i doubt and desire that be to say that something be lack to me and that i be not quite perfect unless i have within me some idea of a being more perfect than myself in comparison with which i should recognise the deficiency of my natureand we can not say that this idea of god be perhaps materially false and that consequently i can derive it from nought ie that possibly it exist in me because i be imperfect a i have just say be the case with idea of heat cold and other such thing for on the contrary a this idea be very clear and distinct and contains within it more objective reality than any other there can be none which be of itself more true nor any in which there can be less suspicion of falsehood the idea i say of this being who be absolutely perfect and infinite be entirely true for although perhaps we can imagine that such a being do not exist we can not nevertheless imagine that hi idea represent nothing real to me a i have say of the idea of cold this idea be also very clear and distinct since all that i conceive clearly and distinctly of the real and the true and of what convey some perfection be in it entirety contain in this idea and this do not cease to be true although i do not comprehend the infinite or though in god there be an infinitude of thing which i can not comprehend nor possibly even reach in any way by thought for it be of the natureof the infinite that my naturewhich be finite and limited should not comprehend it and it be sufficient that i should understand this and that i should judge that all thing which i clearly perceive and in which i know that there be some perfection and possibly likewise an infinitude of property of which i be ignorant be in god formally or eminently so that the idea which i have of him may become the most true most clear and most distinct of all the idea that be in my mind but possibly i be something more than i suppose myself to be and perhaps all those perfection which i attribute to god be in some way potentially in me although they do not yet disclose themselves or issue in action a a matter of fact i be already sensible that my knowledge increase and perfect itself little by little and i see nothing which can prevent it from increase more and more into infinitude nor do i see after it have thus be increase or perfect anything to prevent my be able to acquire by it mean all the other perfection of the divine naturenor finally why the power i have of acquire these perfection if it really exist in me shall not suffice to produce the idea of them at the same time i recognise that this can not be for in the first place although it be true that every day my knowledge acquire new degree of perfection and that there be in my naturemany thing potentially which be not yet there actually nevertheless these excellence do not pertain to or make the small approach to the idea which i have of god in whom there be nothing merely potential but in whom all be present really and actually for it be an infallible token of imperfection in my knowledge that it increase little by little and further although my knowledge grow more and more nevertheless i do not for that reason believe that it can ever be actually infinite since it can never reach a point so high that it will be unable to attain to any great increase but i understand god to be actually infinite so that he can add nothing to hi supreme perfection and finally i perceive that the objective be of an idea can not be produce by a be that exist potentially only which properly speaking be nothing but only by a be which be formal or actual to speak the truth i see nothing in all that i have just say which by the light of naturebe not manifest to anyone who desire to think attentively on the subject but when i slightly relax my attention my mind find it vision somewhat obscure and so to speak blind by the image of sensible object i do not easily recollect the reason why the idea that i possess of a be more perfect then i must necessarily have be place in me by a be which be really more perfect and this be why i wish here to go on to inquire whether i who have this idea can exist if no such be exists and i ask from whom do i then derive my existence perhaps from myself or from my parent or from some other source less perfect than god for we can imagine nothing more perfect than god or even as perfect a he be but be i independent of every other and be i myself the author of my be i should doubt nothing and i should desire nothing and finally no perfection would be lack to me for i should have bestow on myself every perfection of which i possess any idea and should thus be god and it must not be imagine that those thing that be lack to me be perhaps more difficult of attainment than those which i already posse for on the contrary it be quite evident that it be a matter of much great difficulty to bring to pass that i that be to say a thing or a substance that think should emerge out of nothing than it would be to attain to the knowledge of many thing of which i be ignorant and which be only the accident of this think substance but it be clear that if i have of myself possess this great perfection of which i have just speak that be to say if i have be the author of my own existence i should not at least have deny myself the thing which be the more easy to acquire to wit many branch of knowledge of which my naturebe destitute nor should i have deprive myself of any of the thing contain in the idea which i form of god because there be none of them which seem to me specially difficult to acquire and if there be any that be more difficult to acquire they would certainly appear to me to be such suppose i myself be the origin of the other thing which i possess since i should discover in them that my power be limited but though i assume that perhaps i have always exist just a i be at present neither can i escape the force of this reasoning and imagine that the conclusion to be draw from this be that i need not seek for any author of my existence for all the course of my life may be divide into an infinite number of part none of which be in any way dependent on the other and thus from the fact that i be in existence a short time ago it do not follow that i must be in existence now unless some cause at this instant so to speak produce me anew that be to say conserve me it be a a matter of fact perfectly clear and evident to all those who consider with attention the natureof time that in order to be conserve in each moment in which it endure a substance have need of the same power and action as would be necessary to produce and create it anew suppose it do not yet exist so that the light of natureshow u clearly that the distinction between creation and conservation be solely a distinction of the reason all that i thus require here be that i should interrogate myself if i wish to know whether i possess a power which be capable of bring it to pass that i who now be shall still be in the future for since i be nothing but a thinking thing or at least since thus far it be only this portion of myself which be precisely in question at present if such a power do reside in me i should certainly be conscious of it but i be conscious of nothing of the kind and by this i know clearly that i depend on some be different from myself possibly however this be on which i depend be not that which i call god and i be create either by my parent or by some other cause less perfect than god this can not be because a i have just say it be perfectly evident that there must be at least as much reality in the cause a in the effect and thus since i be a thinking thing and posse an idea of god within me whatever in the end be the cause assign to my existence it must be allow that it be likewise a thinking thing and that it possess in itself the idea of all the perfection which i attribute to god we may again inquire whether this cause derive it origin from itself or from some other thing for if from itself it follow by the reason before brought forward that this cause must itself be god for since it possess the virtue of selfexistence it must also without doubt have the power of actually possess all the perfection of which it have the idea that be all those which i conceive a exist in god but if it derive it existence from some other cause than itself we shall again ask for the same reason whether this second cause exists by itself or through another until from one step to another we finally arrive at an ultimate cause which will be god and it be perfectly manifest that in this there can be no regression into infinity since what be in question be not so much the cause which formerly create me a that which conserve me at the present time nor can we suppose that several cause may have concur in my production and that from one i have receive the idea of one of the perfection which i attribute to god and from another the idea of some other so that all these perfection indeed exist somewhere in the universe but not a complete in one unity which be god on the contrary the unity the simplicity or the inseparability of all thing which be in god be one of the principal perfection which i conceive to be in him and certainly the idea of this unity of all divine perfection can not have be place in me by any cause from which i have not likewise receive the idea of all the other perfection for this cause could not make me able to comprehend them a join together in an inseparable unity without have at the same time cause me in some measure to know what they be and in some way to recognise each one of them finally so far a my parent from whom it appear i have spring be concern although all that i have ever be able to believe of them be true that do not make it follow that it be they who conserve me nor be they even the author of my be in any sense in so far a i be a thinking be since what they do be merely to implant certain disposition in that matter in which the self ie the mind which alone i at present identify with myself be by me deem to exist and thus there can be no difficulty in their regard but we must of necessity conclude from the fact alone that i exist or that the idea of a being supremely perfect that be of god be in me that the proof of god existence be ground on the high evidence it only remain to me to examine into the manner in which i have acquire this idea from god for i have not receive it through the sens and it be never present to me unexpectedly a be usual with the idea of sensible thing when these thing present themselves or seem to present themselves to the external organ of my sens nor be it likewise a fiction of my mind for it be not in my power to take from or to add anything to it and consequently the only alternative be that it be innate in me just a the idea of myself be innate in me and one certainly ought not to find it strange that god in create me place this idea within me to be like the mark of the workman imprint on hi work and it be likewise not essential that the mark shall be something different from the work itself for from the sole fact that god create me it be most probable that in some way he have place hi image and similitude upon me and that i perceive this similitude in which the idea of god be contain by mean of the same faculty by which i perceive myself that be to say when i reflect on myself i not only know that i be something imperfect incomplete and dependent on another which incessantly aspire after something which be well and great than myself but i also know that he on whom i depend posse in himself all the great thing towards which i aspire and the idea of which i find within myself and that not indefinitely or potentially alone but really actually and infinitely and that thus he be god and the whole strength of the argument which i have here make use of to prove the existence of god consist in this that i recognize that it be not possible that my natureshould be what it be and indeed that i should have in myself the idea of a god if god do not veritably exist a god i say whose idea be in me ie who possess all those supreme perfection of which our mind may indeed have some idea but without understand them all who be liable to no error or defect and who have none of all those mark which denote imperfection from this it be manifest that he can not be a deceiver since the light of natureteach u that fraud and deception necessarily proceed from some defect but before i examine this matter with more care and pas on to the consideration of other truth which may be derive from it it seem to me right to pause for a while in order to contemplate god himself to ponder at leisure hi marvelous attribute to consider and admire and adore the beauty of this light so resplendent at least as far a the strength of my mind which be in some measure dazzle by the sight will allow me to do so for just a faith teach u that the supreme felicity of the other life consist only in this contemplation of the divine majesty so we continue to learn by experience that a similar meditation though incomparably less perfect cause u to enjoy the great satisfaction of which we be capable in this life i have be well accustom these past day to detach my mind from my sens and i have accurately observe that there be very few thing that one know with certainty respect corporeal object that there be many more which be know to u respect the human mind and yet more still regard god himself so that i shall now without any difficulty abstract my thought from the consideration of sensible or imaginable object and carry them to those which be withdraw from all contact with matter be purely intelligible and certainly the idea which i posse of the human mind inasmuch a it be a thinking thing and not extend in length width and depth nor participate in anything pertain to body be incomparably more distinct than be the idea of any corporeal thing and when i consider that i doubt that be to say that i be an incomplete and dependent be the idea of a be that be complete and independent that be of god present itself to my mind with so much distinctness and clearness and from the fact alone that this idea be find in me or that i who possess this idea exist i conclude so certainly that god exist and that my existence depend entirely on him in every moment of my life that i do not think that the human mind be capable of know anything with more evidence and certitude and it seem to me that i now have before me a road which will lead u from the contemplation of the true god in whom all the treasure of science and wisdom be contain to the knowledge of the other object of the universe for first of all i recognise it to be impossible that he should ever deceive me for in all fraud and deception some imperfection be to be find and although it may appear that the power of deception be a mark of subtilty or power yet the desire to deceive without doubt testifies to malice or feebleness and accordingly can not be find in god in the next place i experience in myself a certain capacity for judge which i have doubtless receive from god like all the other thing that i possess and a he could not desire to deceive me it be clear that he have not give me a faculty that will lead me to err if i use it aright and no doubt respect this matter could remain if it be not that the consequence would seem to follow that i can thus never be deceive for if i hold all that i possess from god and if he have not place in me the capacity for error it seem a though i could never fall into error and it be true that when i think only of god and direct my mind wholly to him i discover in myself no cause of error or falsity yet directly afterwards when recur to myself experience show me that i be nevertheless subject to an infinitude of error a to which when we come to investigate them more closely i notice that not only be there a real and positive idea of god or of a being of supreme perfection present to my mind but also so to speak a certain negative idea of nothing that be of that which be infinitely remove from any kind of perfection and that i be in a sense something intermediate between god and nought ie place in such a manner between the supreme being and nonbeing that there be in truth nothing in me that can lead to error in so far a a sovereign being have form me but that a i in some degree participate likewise in nought or in nonbeing ie in so far a i be not myself the supreme being and a i find myself subject to an infinitude of imperfection i ought not to be astonish if i should fall into error thus do i recognize that error in so far a it be such be not a real thing depend on god but simply a defect and therefore in order to fall into it that i have no need to possess a special faculty give me by god for this very purpose but that i fall into error from the fact that the power give me by god for the purpose of distinguish truth from error be not infinite nevertheless this do not quite satisfy me for error be not a pure negation ie be not the dimple defect or want of some perfection which ought not to be mine but it be a lack of some knowledge which it seem that i ought to possess and on consider the natureof god it do not appear to me possible that he should have give me a faculty which be not perfect of it kind that be which be want in some perfection due to it for if it be true that the more skillful the artizan the more perfect be the work of hi hand what can have be produce by this supreme creator of all thing that be not in all it part perfect and certainly there be no doubt that god could have create me so that i could never have be subject to error it be also certain that he ever will what be best be it then well that i should be subject to err than that i should not in consider this more attentively it occur to me in the first place that i should not be astonish if my intelligence be not capable of comprehend why god act a he do and that there be thus no reason to doubt of hi existence from the fact that i may perhaps find many other thing besides this a to which i be able to understand neither for what reason nor how god have produce them for in the first place knowing that my naturebe extremely feeble and limited and that the natureof god be on the contrary immense incomprehensible and infinite i have no further difficulty in recognise that there be an infinitude of matter in hi power the cause of which transcend my knowledge and this reason suffice to convince me that the specie of cause term final find no useful employment in physical or natural thing for it do not appear to me that i can without temerity seek to investigate the inscrutable end of god it far occur to me that we should not consider one single creature separately when we inquire a to whether the work of god be perfect but should regard all hi creation together for the same thing which might possibly seem very imperfect with some semblance of reason if regard by itself be find to be very perfect if regard a part of the whole universe and although since i resolve to doubt all thing i as yet have only know certainly my own existence and that of god nevertheless since i have recognise the infinite power of god i can not deny that he may have produce many other thing or at least that he have the power of produce them so that i may obtain a place a a part of a great universe whereupon regard myself more closely and consider what be my error for they alone testify to there be any imperfection in me i answer that they depend on a combination of two cause to wit on the faculty of knowledge that rest in me and on the power of choice or of free will that be to say of the understanding and at the same time of the will for by the understand alone i neither assert nor deny anything but apprehend the idea of thing a to which i can form a judgment but no error be properly speak find in it provide the word error be take in it proper signification and though there be possibly an infinitude of thing in the world of which i have no idea in my understanding we can not for all that say that it be deprive of these idea a we might say of something which be require by it naturebut simply it do not possess these because in truth there be no reason to prove that god should have give me a great faculty of knowledge than he have give me and however skillful a workman i represent him to be i should not for all that consider that he be bind to have place in each of hi work all the perfection which he may have be able to place in some i likewise can not complain that god have not give me a free choice or a will which be sufficient ample and perfect since a a matter of fact i be conscious of a will so extended a to be subject to no limit and what seem to me very remarkable in this regard be that of all the quality which i possess there be no one so perfect and so comprehensive that i do not very clearly recognise that it might be yet great and more perfect for to take an example if i consider the faculty of comprehension which i possess i find that it be of very small extent and extremely limited and at the same time i find the idea of another faculty much more ample and even infinite and see that i can form the idea of it i recognise from this very fact that it pertain to the natureof god if in the same way i examine the memory the imagination or some other faculty i do not find any which be not small and circumscribe while in god it be immense or infinite it be freewill alone or liberty of choice which i find to be so great in me that i can conceive no other idea to be more great it be indeed the case that it be for the most part this will that cause me to know that in some manner i bear the image and similitude of god for although the power of will be incomparably great in god than in me both by reason of the knowledge and the power which conjoin with it render it strong and more efficacious and by reason of it object inasmuch a in god it extend to a great many thing it nevertheless do not seem to me great if i consider it formally and precisely in itself for the faculty of will consist alone in our have the power of choose to do a thing or choose not to do it that be to affirm or deny to pursue or to shun it or rather it consist alone in the fact that in order to affirm or deny pursue or shun those thing place before u by the understanding we act so that we be unconscious that any outside force constrains u in do so for in order that i should be free it be not necessary that i should be indifferent a to the choice of one or the other of two contrary but contrariwise the more i lean to the one whether i recognise clearly that the reason of the good and true be to be find in it or whether god so dispose my inward think the more freely do i choose and embrace it and undoubtedly both divine grace and natural knowledge far from diminish my liberty rather increase it and strengthen it hence this indifference which i feel when i be not sway to one side rather than to the other by lack of reason be the low grade of liberty and rather evince a lack or negation in knowledge than a perfection of will for if i always recognise clearly what be true and good i should never have trouble in deliberate a to what judgment or choice i should make and then i should be entirely free without ever be indifferent from all this i recognise that the power of will which i have receive from god be not of itself the source of my error for it be very ample and very perfect of it kind any more than be the power of understand for since i understand nothing but by the power which god have give me for understand there be no doubt that all that i understand i understand a i ought and it be not possible that i err in this whence then come my error they come from the sole fact that since the will be much wider in it range and compass than the understanding i do not restrain it within the same bound but extend it also to thing which i do not understand and a the will be of itself indifferent to these it easily fall into error and sin and choose the evil for the good or the false for the true for example when i lately examine whether anything exist in the world and find that from the very fact that i consider this question it follow very clearly that i myself exist i could not prevent myself from believe that a thing i so clearly conceive be true not that i find myself compel to do so by some external cause but simply because from great clearness in my mind there follow a great inclination of my will and i believe this with so much the great freedom or spontaneity a i possess the less indifference towards it now on the contrary i not only know that i exist inasmuch a i be a thinking thing but a certain representation of corporeal naturebe also present to my mind and it come to pass that i doubt whether this thinking naturewhich be in me or rather by which i be what i be differs from this corporeal natureor whether both be not simply the same thing and i here suppose that i do not yet know any reason to persuade me to adopt the one belief rather than the other from this it follow that i be entirely indifferent a to which of the two i affirm or deny or even whether i abstain from form any judgment in the matter and this indifference do not only extend to matter a to which the understanding have no knowledge but also in general to all those which be not apprehend with perfect clearness at the moment when the will be deliberate upon them for however probable be the conjecture which render me disposed to form a judgment respect anything the simple knowledge that i have that those be conjecture alone and not certain and indubitable reason suffices to occasion me to judge the contrary of this i have have great experience of late when i set aside a false all that i have formerly hold to be absolutely true for the sole reason that i remark that it might in some measure be doubt but if i abstain from give my judgment on any thing when i do not perceive it with sufficient clearness and distinctness it be plain that i act rightly and be not deceive but if i determine to deny or affirm i no longer make use a i should of my free will and if i affirm what be not true it be evident that i deceive myself even though i judge accord to truth this come about only by chance and i do not escape the blame of misuse my freedom for the light of natureteach u that the knowledge of the understanding should always precede the determination of the will and it be in the misuse of the free will that the privation which constitute the characteristic natureof error be meet with privation i say be find in the act in so far a it proceed from me but it be not find in the faculty which i have receive from god nor even in the act in so far a it depend on him for i have certainly no cause to complain that god have not give me an intelligence which be more powerful or a natural light which be strong than that which i have receive from him since it be proper to the finite understand not to comprehend a multitude of thing and it be proper to a create understanding to be finite on the contrary i have every reason to render thanks to god who owe me nothing and who have give me all the perfection i possess and i should be far from charge him with injustice and with have deprive me of or wrongfully withhold from me these perfection which he have not bestow upon me i have further no reason to complain that he have give me a will more ample than my understanding for since the will consist only of one single element and be so to speak indivisible it appear that it naturebe such that nothing can be abstract from it without destroy it and certainly the more comprehensive it be find to be the more reason i have to render gratitude to the giver and finally i must also not complain that god concur with me in form the act of the will that be the judgment in which i go astray because these act be entirely true and good inasmuch a they depend on god and in a certain sense more perfection accrues to my naturefrom the fact that i can form them than if i could not do so a to the privation in which alone the formal reason of error or sin consist it have no need of any concurrence from god since it be not a thing or an existence and since it be not relate to god a to a cause but should be term merely a negation accord to the significance give to these word in the school for in fact it be not an imperfection in god that he have give me the liberty to give or withhold my assent from certain thing a to which he have not place a clear and distinct knowledge in my understanding but it be without doubt an imperfection in me not to make a good use of my freedom and to give my judgment readily on matter which i only understand obscurely i nevertheless perceive that god could easily have create me so that i never should err although i still remain free and endow with a limited knowledge viz by give to my understand a clear and distinct intelligence of all thing a to which i should ever have to deliberate or simply by hi engrave deeply in my memory the resolution never to form a judgment on anything without have a clear and distinct understanding of it so that i could never forget it and it be easy for me to understand that in so far a i consider myself alone and a if there be only myself in the world i should have be much more perfect than i be if god have create me so that i could never err nevertheless i can not deny that in some sense it be a great perfection in the whole universe that certain part should not be exempt from error a other be than that all part should be exactly similar and i have no right to complain if god have place me in the world have not call upon me to play a part that excel all other in distinction and perfection and far i have reason to be glad on the ground that if he have not give me the power of never go astray by the first mean point out above which depend on a clear and evident knowledge of all the thing regard which i can deliberate he have at least left within my power the other mean which be firmly to adhere to the resolution never to give judgment on matter whose truth be not clearly know to me for although i notice a certain weakness in my naturein that i can not continually concentrate my mind on one single thought i can yet by attentive and frequently repeat meditation impress it so forcibly on my memory that i shall never fail to recollect it whenever i have need of it and thus acquire the habit of never go astray and inasmuch a it be in this that the great and principal perfection of man consist it seem to me that i have not gain little by this day meditation since i have discover the source of falsity and error and certainly there can be no other source than that which i have explain for as often a i so restrain my will within the limit of my knowledge that it form no judgment except on matter which be clearly and distinctly represent to it by the understanding i can never be deceive for every clear and distinct conception be without doubt something and hence can not derive it origin from what be nought but must of necessity have god a it author god i say who be supremely perfect can not be the cause of any error and consequently we must conclude that such a conception or such a judgment be true nor have i only learn today what i should avoid in order that i may not err but also how i should act in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth for without doubt i shall arrive at this end if i devote my attention sufficiently to those thing which i perfectly understand and if i separate from these that which i only understand confusedly and with obscurity to these i shall henceforth diligently give heed many other matter respect the attribute of god and my own natureor mind remain for consideration but i shall possibly on another occasion resume the investigation of these now after first note what must be do or avoid in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth my principal task be to endeavour to emerge from the state of doubt into which i have these last day fall and to see whether nothing certain can be know regard material thing but before examine whether any such object a i conceive exist outside of me i must consider the idea of them in so far a they be in my thought and see which of them be distinct and which confuse in the first place i be able distinctly to imagine that quantity which philosophers commonly call continuous or the extension in length breadth or depth that be in this quantity or rather in the object to which it be attribute far i can number in it many different part and attribute to each of it part many sort of size figure situation and local movement and finally i can assign to each of these movement all degree of duration and not only do i know these thing with distinctness when i consider them in general but likewise however little i apply my attention to the matter i discover an infinitude of particular respect number figure movement and other such thing whose truth be so manifest and so well accord with my naturethat when i begin to discover them it seem to me that i learn nothing new or recollect what i formerly know that be to say that i for the first time perceive thing which be already present to my mind although i have not a yet apply my mind to them and what i here find to be most important be that i discover in myself an infinitude of idea of certain thing which can not be esteem a pure negation although they may possibly have no existence outside of my thought and which be not frame by me although it be within my power either to think or not to think them but which posse naturewhich be true and immutable for example when i imagine a triangle although there may nowhere in the world be such a figure outside my thought or ever have be there be nevertheless in this figure a certain determinate natureform or essence which be immutable and eternal which i have not invent and which in no wise depend on my mind a appear from the fact that diverse property of that triangle can be demonstrate viz that it three angle be equal to two right angle that the great side be subtend by the great angle and the like which now whether i wish it or do not wish it i recognise very clearly a pertain to it although i never think of the matter at all when i imagine a triangle for the first time and which therefore can not be say to have be invent by me nor do the objection hold good that possibly this idea of a triangle have reach my mind through the medium of my sens since i have sometimes see body triangular in shape because i can form in my mind an infinitude of other figure regard which we can not have the least conception of their ever have be object of sense and i can nevertheless demonstrate various property pertain to their natureas well a to that of the triangle and these must certainly all be true since i conceive them clearly hence they be something and not pure negation for it be perfectly clear that all that be true be something and i have already fully demonstrate that all that i know clearly be true and even although i have not demonstrate this the natureof my mind be such that i could not prevent myself from hold them to be true so long a i conceive them clearly and i recollect that even when i be still strongly attach to the object of sense i count a the most certain those truth which i conceive clearly a regard figure number and the other matter which pertain to arithmetic and geometry and in general to pure and abstract mathematics but now if just because i can draw the idea of something from my thought it follow that all which i know clearly and distinctly a pertain to this object do really belong to it may i not derive from this an argument demonstrate the existence of god it be certain that i no less find the idea of god that be to say the idea of a supremely perfect being in me than that of any figure or number whatever it be and i do not know any less clearly and distinctly that an actual and eternal existence pertains to this naturethan i know that all that which i be able to demonstrate of some figure or number truly pertain to the natureof this figure or number and therefore although all that i conclude in the preceding meditation be find to be false the existence of god would pass with me a at least as certain a i have ever hold the truth of mathematics which concern only number and figure to be this indeed be not at first manifest since it would seem to present some appearance of be a sophism for be accustom in all other thing to make a distinction between existence and essence i easily persuade myself that the existence can be separate from the essence of god and that we can thus conceive god a not actually exist but nevertheless when i think of it with more attention i clearly see that existence can no more be separate from the essence of god than can it have it three angle equal to two right angle be separate from the essence of a rectilinear triangle or the idea of a mountain from the idea of a valley and so there be not any less repugnance to our conceive a god that be a being supremely perfect to whom existence be lack that be to say to whom a certain perfection be lack than to conceive of a mountain which have no valley but although i can not really conceive of a god without existence any more than a mountain without a valley still from the fact that i conceive of a mountain with a valley it do not follow that there be such a mountain in the world similarly although i conceive of god a possess existence it would seem that it do not follow that there be a god which exist for my thought do not impose any necessity upon thing and just a i may imagine a winged horse although no horse with wing exists so i could perhaps attribute existence to god although no god exist but a sophism be conceal in this objection for from the fact that i can not conceive a mountain without a valley it do not follow that there be any mountain or any valley in existence but only that the mountain and the valley whether they exist or do not exist can not in any way be separate one from the other while from the fact that i can not conceive god without existence it follow that existence be inseparable from him and hence that he really exist not that my thought can bring this to pass or impose any necessity on thing but on the contrary because the necessity which lie in the thing itself ie the necessity of the existence of god determine me to think in this way for it be not within my power to think of god without existence that be of a supremely perfect being devoid of a supreme perfection though it be in my power to imagine a horse either with wing or without wing and we must not here object that it be in truth necessary for me to assert that god exist after have presuppose that he possess every sort of perfection since existence be one of these but that a a matter of fact my original supposition be not necessary just a it be not necessary to consider that all quadrilateral figure can be inscribe in the circle for suppose i think this i should be constrain to admit that the rhombus might be inscribe in the circle since it be a quadrilateral figure which however be manifestly false we must not i say make any such allegation because although it be not necessary that i should at any time entertain the notion of god nevertheless whenever it happen that i think of a first and a sovereign being and so to speak derive the idea of him from the storehouse of my mind it be necessary that i should attribute to him every sort of perfection although i do not get so far a to enumerate them all or to apply my mind to each one in particular and this necessity suffice to make me conclude after have recognise that existence be a perfection that this first and sovereign being really exist just a though it be not necessary for me ever to imagine any triangle yet whenever i wish to consider a rectilinear figure compose only of three angle it be absolutely essential that i should attribute to it all those property which serve to bring about the conclusion that it three angle be not great than two right angle even although i may not then be consider this point in particular but when i consider which figure be capable of be inscribe in the circle it be in no wise necessary that i should think that all quadrilateral figure be of this number on the contrary i can not even pretend that this be the case so long a i do not desire to accept anything which i can not conceive clearly and distinctly and in consequence there be a great difference between the false supposition such a this and the true idea bear within me the first and principal of which be that of god for really i discern in many way that this idea be not something factitious and depend solely on my thought but that it be the image of a true and immutable naturefirst of all because i can not conceive anything but god himself to whose essence existence necessarily pertain in the second place because it be not possible for me to conceive two or more god in this same position and grant that there be one such god who now exist i see clearly that it be necessary that he should have exist from all eternity and that he must exist eternally and finally because i know an infinitude of other property in god none of which i can either diminish or change for the rest whatever proof or argument i avail myself of we must always return to the point that it be only those thing which we conceive clearly and distinctly that have the power of persuade me entirely and although amongst the matter which i conceive of in this way some indeed be manifestly obvious to all while other only manifest themselves to those who consider them closely and examine them attentively still after they have once be discover the latter be not esteem a any less certain than the former for example in the case of every rightangled triangle although it do not so manifestly appear that the square of the base be equal to the square of the two other side a that this base be opposite to the great angle still when this have once be apprehend we be just a certain of it truth a of the truth of the other and a regard god if my mind be not preoccupy with prejudice and if my thought do not find itself on all hand divert by the continual pressure of sensible thing there would be nothing which i could know more immediately and more easily than him for be there anything more manifest than that there be a god that be to say a supreme being to whose essence alone existence pertains and although for a firm grasp of this truth i have need of a strenuous application of mind at present i not only feel myself to be a assure of it a of all that i hold a most certain but i also remark that the certainty of all other thing depend on it so absolutely that without this knowledge it be impossible ever to know anything perfectly for although i be of such a naturethat as long a i understand anything very clearly and distinctly i be naturally impel to believe it to be true yet because i be also of such a naturethat i can not have my mind constantly fix on the same object in order to perceive it clearly and a i often recollect have form a past judgment without at the same time properly recollect the reason that lead me to make it it may happen meanwhile that other reason present themselves to me which would easily cause me to change my opinion if i be ignorant of the fact of the existence of god and thus i should have no true and certain knowledge but only vague and vacillating opinion thus for example when i consider the natureof a rectilinear triangle i who have some little knowledge of the principle of geometry recognize quite clearly that the three angle be equal to two right angle and it be not possible for me not to believe this so long a i apply my mind to it demonstration but so soon a i abstain from attend to the proof although i still recollect have clearly comprehend it it may easily occur that i come to doubt it truth if i be ignorant of there be a god for i can persuade myself of have be so constitute by naturethat i can easily deceive myself even in those matter which i believe myself to apprehend with the great evidence and certainty especially when i recollect that i have frequently judge matter to be true and certain which other reason have afterwards impel me to judge to be altogether false but after i have recognise that there be a god because at the same time i have also recognise that all thing depend upon him and that he be not a deceiver and from that have infer that what i perceive clearly and distinctly can not fail to be true although i no longer pay attention to the reason for which i have judge this to be true provide that i recollect have clearly and distinctly perceive it no contrary reason can be bring forward which could ever cause me to doubt of it truth and thus i have a true and certain knowledge of it and this same knowledge extends likewise to all other thing which i recollect have formerly demonstrate such a the truth of geometry and the like for what can be allege against them to cause me to place them in doubt will it be say that my naturebe such a to cause me to be frequently deceive but i already know that i can not be deceive in the judgment whose ground i know clearly will it be say that i formerly hold many thing to be true and certain which i have afterwards recognise to be false but i have not have any clear and distinct knowledge of these thing and not a yet know the rule whereby i assure myself of the truth i have be impel to give my assent from reason which i have since recognise to be less strong than i have at the time imagine them to be what further objection can then be raise that possibly i be dream an objection i myself make a little while ago or that all the thought which i now have be no more true than the phantasy of my dream but even though i sleep the case would be the same for all that be clearly present to my mind be absolutely true and so i very clearly recognise that the certainty and truth of all knowledge depend alone on the knowledge of the true god in so much that before i know him i could not have a perfect knowledge of any other thing and now that i know him i have the mean of acquire a perfect knowledge of an infinitude of thing not only of those which relate to god himself and other intellectual matter but also of those which pertain to corporeal naturein so far a it be the object of pure mathematics which have no concern with whether it exist or not nothing far now remain but to inquire whether material thing exist and certainly i at least know that these may exist in so far a they be consider a the object of pure mathematics since in this aspect i perceive them clearly and distinctly for there be no doubt that god possess the power to produce everything that i be capable of perceive with distinctness and i have never deem that anything be impossible for him unless i find a contradiction in attempt to conceive it clearly far the faculty of imagination which i possess and of which experience tell me i make use when i apply myself to the consideration of material thing be capable of persuade me of their existence for when i attentively consider what imagination be i find that it be nothing but a certain application of the faculty of knowledge to the body which be immediately present to it and which therefore exists and to render this quite clear i remark in the first place the difference that exist between the imagination and pure intellection or conception for example when i imagine a triangle i do not conceive it only a a figure comprehend by three line but i also apprehend these three line a present by the power and inward vision of my mind and this be what i call imagine but if i desire to think of a chiliagon i certainly conceive truly that it be a figure compose of a thousand side just as easily a i conceive of a triangle that it be a figure of three side only but i can not in any way imagine the thousand side of a chiliagon a i do the three side of a triangle nor do i so to speak regard them a present with the eye of my mind and although in accordance with the habit i have form of always employ the aid of my imagination when i think of corporeal thing it may happen that in imagine a chiliagon i confusedly represent to myself some figure yet it be very evident that this figure be not a chiliagon since it in no way differs from that which i represent to myself when i think of a myriagon or any other manysided figure nor do it serve my purpose in discover the property which go to form the distinction between a chiliagon and other polygon but if the question turn upon a pentagon it be quite true that i can conceive it figure as well a that of a chiliagon without the help of my imagination but i can also imagine it by apply the attention of my mind to each of it five side and at the same time to the space which they enclose and thus i clearly recognise that i have need of a particular effort of mind in order to effect the act of imagination such a i do not require in order to understand and this particular effort of mind clearly manifest the difference which exist between imagination and pure intellection i remark besides that this power of imagination which be in one inasmuch a it differ from the power of understanding be in no wise a necessary element in my natureor in my essence that be to say in the essence of my mind for although i do not possess it i should doubtless ever remain the same a i now be from which it appear that we might conclude that it depend on something which differs from me and i easily conceive that if some body exist with which my mind be conjoin and unite in such a way that it can apply itself to consider it when it please it may be that by this mean it can imagine corporeal object so that this mode of think differs from pure intellection only inasmuch a mind in it intellectual activity in some manner turn on itself and consider some of the idea which it possess in itself while in imagine it turn towards the body and there beholds in it something conformable to the idea which it have either conceive of itself or perceive by the sens i easily understand i say that the imagination could be thus constitute if it be true that body exists and because i can discover no other convenient mode of explain it i conjecture with probability that body do exist but this be only with probability and although i examine all thing with care i nevertheless do not find that from this distinct idea of corporeal naturewhich i have in my imagination i can derive any argument from which there will necessarily be deduce the existence of body but i be in the habit of imagine many other thing besides this corporeal naturewhich be the object of pure mathematics to wit the colour sound scent pain and other such thing although less distinctly and inasmuch a i perceive these thing much well through the sens by the medium of which and by the memory they seem to have reach my imagination i believe that in order to examine them more conveniently it be right that i should at the same time investigate the natureof sense perception and that i should see if from the idea which i apprehend by this mode of thought which i call feel i can not derive some certain proof of the existence of corporeal object and first of all i shall recall to my memory those matter which i hitherto hold to be true a have perceive them through the sens and the foundation on which my belief have rest in the next place i shall examine the reason which have since oblige me to place them in doubt in the last place i shall consider which of them i must now believe first of all then i perceive that i have a head hand foot and all other member of which this body which i consider a a part or possibly even a the whole of myself be compose further i be sensible that this body be place amidst many other from which it be capable of be affect in many different way beneficial and hurtful and i remark that a certain feeling of pleasure accompany those that be beneficial and pain those which be harmful and in addition to this pleasure and pain i also experience hunger thirst and other similar appetite a also certain corporeal inclination towards joy sadness anger and other similar passion and outside myself in addition to extension figure and motion of body i remark in them hardness heat and all other tactic quality and further light and colour and scent and sound the variety of which give me the mean of distinguish the sky the earth the sea and generally all the other body one from the other and certainly consider the idea of all these quality which present themselves to my mind and which alone i perceive properly or immediately it be not without reason that i believe myself to perceive object quite different from my thought to wit body from which those idea proceed for i find by experience that these idea present themselves to me without my consent be requisite so that i could not perceive any object however desirous i might be unless it be present to the organ of sense and it be not in my power not to perceive it when it be present and because the idea which i receive through the sens be much more lively more clear and even in their own way more distinct than any of those which i could of myself frame in meditation or than those i find impressed on my memory it appear a though they could not have proceed from my mind so that they must necessarily have be produce in me by some other thing and have no knowledge of those object except the knowledge which the idea themselves give me nothing be more likely to occur to my mind than that the object be similar to the idea which be cause and because i likewise remember that i have formerly make use of my sens rather than my reason and recognise that the idea which i form of myself be not so distinct a those which i perceive through the sens and that they be most frequently even compose of portion of these last i persuade myself easily that i have no idea in my mind which have not formerly come to me through the sens nor be it without some reason that i believe that this body which be a certain special right i call my own belong to me more properly and more strictly than any other for in fact i could never be separate from it a from other body i experience in it and on account of it all my appetite and affection and finally i be touch by the feeling of pain and the titillation of pleasure in it part and not in the part of other body which be separate from it but when i inquire why from some i know not what painful sensation there follow sadness of mind and from the pleasurable sensation there arise joy or why this mysterious pinching of the stomach which i call hunger cause me to desire to eat and dryness of throat cause a desire to drink and so on i could give no reason except that natureteach me so for there be certainly no affinity that i at least can understand between the craving of the stomach and the desire to eat any more than between the perception of whatever cause pain and the thought of sadness which arise from this perception and in the same way it appear to me that i have learn from natureall the other judgment which i form regard the object of my sens since i remark that these judgment be form in me before i have the leisure to weigh and consider any reason which might oblige me to make them but afterwards many experience little by little destroyed all the faith which i have rest in my sens for i from time to time observe that those tower which from afar appear to me to be round more closely observe seem square and that colossal statue raise on the summit of these tower appear a quite tiny statue when view from the bottom and so in an infinitude of other case i find error in judgment found on the external sens and not only in those found on the external sens but even in those found on the internal a well for be there anything more intimate or more internal than pain and yet i have learn from some person whose arm or leg have be cut off that they sometimes seem to feel pain in the part which have be amputate which make me think that i could not be quite certain that it be a certain member which pain me even although i felt pain in it and to those ground of doubt i have lately add two other which be very general the first be that i never have believe myself to feel anything in wake moment which i can not also sometimes believe myself to feel when i sleep and a i do not think that these thing which i seem to feel in sleep proceed from object outside of me i do not see any reason why i should have this belief regard object which i seem to perceive while awake the other be that be still ignorant or rather suppose myself to be ignorant of the author of my be i saw nothing to prevent me from have be so constitute by naturethat i might be deceive even in matter which seem to me to be most certain and a to the ground on which i be formerly persuade of the truth of sensible object i have not much trouble in reply to them for since natureseem to cause me to lean towards many thing from which reason repel me i do not believe that i should trust much to the teaching of natureand although the idea which i receive by the sens do not depend on my will i do not think that one should for that reason conclude that they proceed from thing different from myself since possibly some faculty might be discover in me though hitherto unknown to me which produce them but now that i begin to know myself good and to discover more clearly the author of my be i do not in truth think that i should rashly admit all the matter which the sens seem to teach u but on the other hand i do not think that i should doubt them all universally and first of all because i know that all thing which i apprehend clearly and distinctly can be create by god a i apprehend them it suffice that i be able to apprehend one thing apart from another clearly and distinctly in order to be certain that the one be different from the other since they may be make to exist in separation at least by the omnipotence of god and it do not signify by what power this separation be make in order to compel me to judge them to be different and therefore just because i know certainly that i exist and that meanwhile i do not remark that any other thing necessarily pertain to my natureor essence excepting that i be a thinking thing i rightly conclude that my essence consist solely in the fact that i be a thinking thin or a substance whose whole essence or naturebe to think and although possibly or rather certainly a i shall say in a moment i possess a body with which i be very intimately conjoin yet because on the one side i have a clear and distinct idea of myself inasmuch a i be only a thinking and unextended thing and a on the other i possess a distinct idea of body inasmuch a it be only an extended and unthinking thing it be certain that this i that be to say my soul by which i be what i be be entirely and absolutely distinct from my body and can exist without it i far find in myself faculty imploying mode of think peculiar to themselves to wit the faculty of imagination and feeling without which i can easily conceive myself clearly and distinctly a a complete be while on the other hand they can not be so conceived apart from me that be without an intelligent substance in which they reside for in the notion we have of these faculty or to use the language of the school in their formal concept some kind of intellection be comprise from which i infer that they be distinct from me a it mode be from a thing i observe also in me some other faculty such a that of change of position the assumption of different figure and such like which can not be conceive any more than can the precede apart from some substance to which they be attach and consequently can not exist without it but it be very clear that these faculty if it be true that they exist must be attach to some corporeal or extend substance and not to an intelligent substance since in the clear and distinct conception of these there be some sort of extension find to be present but no intellection at all there be certainly far in me a certain passive faculty of perception that be of receive and recognise the idea of sensible thing but this would be useless to me and i could in no way avail myself of it if there be not either in me or in some other thing another active faculty capable of form and produce these idea but this active faculty can not exist in me inasmuch a i be a thing that think see that it do not presuppose thought and also that those idea be often produce in me without my contributing in any way to the same and often even against my will it be thus necessarily the case that the faculty reside in some substance different from me in which all the reality which be objectively in the idea that be produce by this faculty be formally or eminently contain a i remark before and this substance be either a body that be a corporeal naturein which there be contain formally and really all that which be objectively and by representation in those idea or it be god himself or some other creature more noble than body in which that same be contain eminently but since god be no deceiver it be very manifest that he do not communicate to me these idea immediately and by himself nor yet by the intervention of some creature in which their reality be not formally but only eminently contain for since he have give me no faculty to recognise that this be the case but on the other hand a very great inclination to believe that they be send to me or that they be convey to me by corporeal object i do not see how he could be defend from the accusation of deceit if these idea be produce by cause other than corporeal object hence we must allow that corporeal thing exist however they be perhaps not exactly what we perceive by the sens since this comprehension by the sens be in many instance very obscure and confused but we must at least admit that all thing which i conceive in them clearly and distinctly that be to say all thing which speak generally be comprehend in the object of pure mathematics be truly to be recognise a external object a to other thing however which be either particular only a for example that the sun be of such and such a figure etc or which be less clearly and distinctly conceive such a light sound pain and the like it be certain that although they be very dubious and uncertain yet on the sole ground that god be not a deceiver and that consequently he have not permit any falsity to exist in my opinion which he have not likewise give me the faculty of correct i may assuredly hope to conclude that i have within me the mean of arrive at the truth even here and first of all there be no doubt that in all thing which natureteach me there be some truth contain for by natureconsider in general i now understand no other thing than either god himself or els the order and disposition which god have establish in created thing and by my naturein particular i understand no other thing than the complexus of all the thing which god have give me but there be nothing which this natureteach me more expressly nor more sensibly than that i have a body which be adversely affected when i feel pain which have need of food or drink when i experience the feeling of hunger and thirst and so on nor can i doubt there be some truth in all this naturealso teach me by these sensation of pain hunger thirst etc that i be not only lodge in my body a a pilot in a vessel but that i be not only lodge in my body a a pilot in a vessel but that i be very closely united to it and so to speak so intermingled with it that i seem to compose with it one whole for if that be not the case when my body be hurt i who be merely a think thing should not feel pain for i should perceive this wound by the understand only just a the sailor perceives by sight when something be damage in hi vessel and when my body have need of drink or food i should clearly understand the fact without be warn of it by confused feeling of hunger and thirst for all these sensation of hunger thirst pain etc be in truth none other than certain confused mode of thought which be produce by the union and apparent intermingling of mind and body moreover natureteach me that many other body exist around mine of which some be to be avoid and other seek after and certainly from the fact that i be sensible of different sort of colour sound scent taste heat hardness etc i very easily conclude that there be in the body from which all these diverse senseperceptions proceed certain variation which answer to them although possibly these be not really at all similar to them and also from the fact that amongst these different senseperceptions some be very agreeable to me and other disagreeable it be quite certain that my body or rather myself in my entirety inasmuch a i be form of body and soul may receive different impression agreeable and disagreeable from the other body which surround it but there be many other thing which natureseem to have teach me but which at the same time i have never really receive from her but which have be bring about in my mind by a certain habit which i have of form inconsiderate judgment on thing and thus it may easily happen that these judgment contain some error take for example the opinion which i hold that all space in which there be nothing that affect or make an impression on my sens be void that in a body which be warm there be something entirely similar to the idea of heat which be in me that in a white or green body there be the same whiteness or greenness that i perceive that in a bitter or sweet body there be the same taste and so on in other instance that the star the tower and all other distant body be of the same figure and size a they appear from far off to our eye etc but in order that in this there should be nothing which i do not conceive distinctly i should define exactly what i really understand when i say that i be taught somewhat by naturefor here i take naturein a more limited signification than when i term it the sum of all the thing give me by god since in this sum many thing be comprehend which only pertain to mind and to these i do not refer in speaking of naturesuch a the notion which i have of the fact that what have once be do can not ever be undone and an infinitude of such thing which i know by the light of naturewithout the help of the body and see that it comprehend many other matter besides which only pertain to body and be no longer here contain under the name of naturesuch a the quality of weight which it possess and the like with which i also do not deal for in talk of naturei only treat of those thing give by god to me a a be compose of mind and body but the naturehere describe truly teach me to flee from thing which cause the sensation of pain and seek after the thing which communicate to me the sentiment of pleasure and so forth but i do not see that beyond this it teach me that from those diverse senseperceptions we should ever form any conclusion regard thing outside of u without have carefully and maturely mentally examine them beforehand for it seem to me that it be mind alone and not mind and body in conjunction that be requisite to a knowledge of the truth in regard to such thing thus although a star make no large an impression on my eye than the flame of a little candle there be yet in me no real or positive propensity impel me to believe that it be not great than that flame but i have judge it to be so from my early year without any rational foundation and although in approach fire i feel heat and in approach it a little too near i even feel pain there be at the same time no reason in this which could persuade me that there be in the fire something resemble this heat any more than there be in it something resemble the pain all that i have any reason to believe from this be that there be something in it whatever it may be which excite in me these sensation of heat or of pain so also although there be space in which i find nothing which excite my sens i must not from that conclude that these space contain no body for i see in this a in other similar thing that i have be in the habit of pervert the order of naturebecause these perception of sense have bee place within me by naturemerely for the purpose of signify to my mind what thing be beneficial or hurtful to the composite whole of which it form a part and be up to that point sufficiently clear and distinct i yet avail myself of them a though they be absolute rule by which i might immediately determine the essence of the body which be outside me a to which in fact they can teach me nothing but what be most obscure and confused but i have already sufficiently consider how notwithstanding the supreme goodness of god falsity enters into the judgment i make only here a new difficulty be present one respect those thing the pursuit or avoidance of which be teach me by natureand also respect the internal sensation which i possess and in which i seem to have sometimes detect error and thus to be directly deceive by my own natureto take an example the agreeable taste of some food in which poison have be intermingle may induce me to partake of the poison and thus deceive me it be true at the same time that in this case naturemay be excuse for it only induce me to desire food in which i find a pleasant taste and not to desire the poison which be unknown to it and thus i can infer nothing from this fact except that my naturebe not omniscient at which there be certainly no reason to be astonish since man be finite in naturecan only have knowledge the perfect of which be limited but we not unfrequently deceive ourselves even in those thing to which we be directly impel by naturea happens with those who when they be sick desire to drink or eat thing hurtful to them it will perhaps be say here that the cause of their deceptiveness be that their naturebe corrupt but that do not remove the difficulty because a sick man be none the less truly god creature than he who be in health and it be therefore a repugnant to god goodness for the one to have a deceitful naturea it be for the other and a a clock compose of wheel and counterweight no less exactly observe the law of naturewhen it be badly make and do not show the time properly than when it entirely satisfy the wish of it maker and a if i consider the body of a man a be a sort of machine so build up and compose of nerve muscle vein blood and skin that though there be no mind in it at all it would not cease to have the same motion a at present exception be make of those movement which be due to the direction of the will and in consequence depend upon the mind a apposed to those which operate by the disposition of it organ i easily recognise that it would be a natural to this body suppose it to be for example dropsical to suffer the parched of the throat which usually signify to the mind the feeling of thirst and to be dispose by this parched feeling to move the nerve and other part in the way requisite for drinking and thus to augment it malady and do harm to itself a it be natural to it when it have no indisposition to be impel to drink for it good by a similar cause and although consider the use to which the clock have be destine by it maker i may say that it deflect from the order of it naturewhen it do not indicate the hour correctly and a in the same way consider the machine of the human body a have be form by god in order to have in itself all the movement usually manifest there i have reason for thinking that it do not follow the order of naturewhen if the throat be dry drinking do harm to the conservation of health nevertheless i recognise at the same time that this last mode of explain naturebe very different from the other for this be but a purely verbal characterisation depend entirely on my thought which compare a sick man and a badly construct clock with the idea which i have of a healthy man and a well make clock and it be hence extrinsic to the thing to which it be apply but accord to the other interpretation of the term naturei understand something which be truly find in thing and which be therefore not without some truth but certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it be only so to speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say that it naturebe corrupt inasmuch a apart from the need to drink the throat be parch yet in regard to the composite whole that be to say to the mind or soul unite to this body it be not a purely verbal predicate but a real error of naturefor it to have thirst when drinking would be hurtful to it and thus it still remain to inquire how the goodness of god do not prevent the natureof man so regarded from be fallacious in order to begin this examination then i here say in the first place that there be a great difference between mind and body inasmuch a body be by naturealways divisible and the mind be entirely indivisible for a a matter of fact when i consider the mind that be to say myself inasmuch a i be only a thinking thing i can not distinguish in myself any part but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire and although the whole mind seem to be unite to the whole body yet if a foot or an arm or some other part be separate from my body i be aware that nothing have be take away from my mind and the faculty of willing feel conceive etc can not be properly speak say to be it part for it be one and the same mind which employ itself in willing and in feeling and understanding but it be quite otherwise with corporeal or extended object for there be not one of these imaginable by me which my mind can not easily divide into part and which consequently i do not recognise a be divisible this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man be entirely different from the body if i have not already learn it from other source i further notice that the mind do not receive the impression from all part of the body immediately but only from the brain or perhaps even from one of it small part to wit from that in which the common sense be say to reside which whenever it be dispose in the same particular way convey the same thing to the mind although meanwhile the other portion of the body may be differently dispose a be testify by innumerable experiment which it be unnecessary here to recount i notice also that the natureof body be such that none of it part can be move by another part a little way off which can not also be move in the same way by each one of the part which be between the two although this more remote part do not act at all a for example in the cord abcd which be in tension if we pull the last part d the first part a will not be move in any way differently from what would be the case if one of the intervening part b or c be pull and the last part d be to remain unmoved and in the same way when i feel pain in my foot my knowledge of physic teach me that this sensation be communicate by mean of nerve disperse through the foot which be extend like cord from there to the brain when they be contract in the foot at the same time contract the inmost portion of the brain which be their extremity and place of origin and then excite a certain movement which naturehave establish in order to cause the mind to be affect by a sensation of pain represent a exist in the foot but because these nerve must pass through the tibia the thigh the loins the back and the neck in order to reach from the leg to the brain it may happen that although their extremity which be in the foot be not affect but only certain one of their intervening part which pass by the loin or the neck this action will excite the same movement in the brain that might have be excite there by a hurt receive in the foot in consequence of which the mind will necessarily feel in the foot the same pain a if it have receive a hurt and the same hold good of all the other perception of our sens i notice finally that since each of the movement which be in the portion of the brain by which the mind be immediately affected brings about one particular sensation only we can not under the circumstance imagine anything more likely than that this movement amongst all the sensation which it be capable of impress on it cause mind to be affect by that one which be best fit and most generally useful for the conservation of the human body when it be in health but experience make u aware that all the feeling with which natureinspire u be such a i have just speak of and there be therefore nothing in them which do not give testimony to the power and goodness of the god who have produce them thus for example when the nerve which be in the foot be violently or more than usually move their movement passing through the medulla of the spine to the inmost part of the brain give a sign to the mind which make it feel somewhat to wit pain a though in the foot by which the mind be excite to do it utmost to remove the cause of the evil a dangerous and hurtful to the foot it be true that god could have constitute the natureof man in such a way that this same movement in the brain would have convey something quite different to the mind for example it might have produce consciousness of itself either in so far a it be in the brain or a it be in the foot or a it be in some other place between the foot and the brain or it might finally have produce consciousness of anything els whatsoever but none of all this would have contribute so well to the conservation of the body similarly when we desire to drink a certain dryness of the throat be produce which move it nerve and by their mean the internal portion of the brain and this movement cause in the mind the sensation of thirst because in this case there be nothing more useful to u than to become aware that we have need to drink for the conservation o our health and the same hold good in other instance from this it be quite clear that notwithstanding the supreme goodness of god the natureof man inasmuch a it be compose of mind and body can not be otherwise than sometimes a source of deception for if there be any cause which excite not in the foot but in some part of the nerve which be extend between the foot and the brain or even in the brain itself the same movement which usually be produce when the foot be detrimentally affected pain will be experience a though it be in the foot and the sense will thus naturally be deceive for since the same movement in the brain be capable of cause but one sensation in the mind and this sensation be much more frequently excite by a cause which hurt the foot than by another exist in some other quarter it be reasonable that it should convey to the mind pain in the foot rather than in any other part of the body and although the parched of the throat do not always proceed a it usually do from the fact that drinking be necessary for the health of the body but sometimes come from quite a different cause a be the case with dropsical patient it be yet much good that it should mislead on this occasion than if on the other hand it be always to deceive u when the body be in good health and so on in similar case and certainly this consideration be of great service to me not only in enable me to recognise all the error to which my naturebe subject but also in enable me to avoid them or to correct them more easily for know that all my sens more frequently indicate to me truth than falsehood respect the thing which concern that which be beneficial to the body and be able almost always to avail myself of many of them in order to examine one particular thing and besides that be able to make use of my memory in order to connect the present with the past and of my understand which already have discover all the cause of my error i ought no longer to fear that falsity may be find in matter every day present to me by my sens and i ought to set aside all the doubt of these past day a hyperbolical and ridiculous particularly that very common uncertainty respect sleep which i could not distinguish from the wake state for at present i find a very notable difference between the two inasmuch a our memory can never connect our dream one with the other or with the whole course of our life a it unite event which happen to u while we be awake and a a matter of fact if someone while i be awake quite suddenly appear to me and disappear as fast a do the image which i see in sleep so that i could not know from whence the form come nor whither it go it would not be without reason that i should deem it a spectre or a phantom form by my brain and similar to those which i form in sleep rather than a real man but when i perceive thing a to which i know distinctly both the place from which they proceed and that in which they be and the time at which they appear to me and when without any interruption i can connect the perception which i have of them with the whole course of my life i be perfectly assure that these perception occur while i be wake and not during sleep and i ought in no wise to doubt the truth of such matter if after have call up all my sens my memory and my understanding to examine them nothing be bring to evidence by any one of them which be repugnant to what be set forth by the other for because god be in no wise a deceiver it follow that i be not deceive in this but because the exigency of action often oblige u to make up our mind before have leisure to examine matter carefully we must confess that the life of man be very frequently subject to error in respect to individual object and we must in the end acknowledge the infirmity of our nature
