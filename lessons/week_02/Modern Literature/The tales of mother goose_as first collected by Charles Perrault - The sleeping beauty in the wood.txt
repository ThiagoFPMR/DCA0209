round about the park such a vast number of tree great and small bush and bramble twin one within another that neither man nor beast could pass through so that nothing could be see but the very top of the tower of the palace and that too only from afar off every one knew that this also be the work of the fairy in order that while the princess sleep she should have nothing to fear from curious people after a hundred year the son of the king then reign who be of another family from that of the sleep princess be ahunting on that side of the country and he ask what those tower be which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood every one answer accord a they have hear some say that it be an old haunt castle other that all the witch of the country hold their midnight revel there but the common opinion be that it be an ogres dwelling and that he carry to it all the little childhe could catch so a to eat them up at hi leisure without any one be able to follow him for he alone have the power to make hi way through the wood the prince do not know what to believe and presently a very aged countryman spake to him thus may it please your royal highness more than fifty year since i hear from my father that there be then in this castle the most beautiful princess that be ever see that she must sleep there a hundred year and that she should be wake by a king son for whom she be reserve the young prince on hear this be all on fire he think without weigh the matter that he could put an end to this rare adventure and push on by love and the desire of glory resolve at once to look into it as soon a he begin to get near to the wood all the great tree the bush and bramble give way of themselves to let him pass through he walk up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue and you can imagine he be a good deal surprise when he saw none of hi people follow him because the tree close again as soon a he have pass through them however he do not cease from continue hi way a young prince in search of glory be ever valiant he come into a spacious outer court and what he saw be enough to freeze him with horror a frightful silence reign over all the image of death be everywhere and there be nothing to be see but what seem to be the outstretched body of dead men and animal he however very well know by the ruby face and pimpled nose of the porter that they be only asleep and their goblet wherein still remain some drop of wine show plainly that they have fall asleep while drink their wine he then cross a court pave with marble go up the stair and come into the guard chamber where guard be stand in their rank with their musket upon their shoulder and snore with all their might he go through several room full of gentleman and ladies some standing and other sit but all be asleep he come into a gilded chamber where he saw upon a bed the curtain of which be all open the most beautiful sight ever behold a princess who appear to be about fifteen or sixteen
