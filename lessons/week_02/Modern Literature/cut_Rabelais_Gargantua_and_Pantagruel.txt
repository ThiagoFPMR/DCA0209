alcibiades in that dialogue of plato which be entitle the banquet whilst he be set forth the praise of hi schoolmaster socrates without all question the prince of philosopher amongst other discourse to that purpose say that he resemble the silene silene of old be little box like those we now may see in the shop of apothecary paint on the outside with wanton toyish figure a harpy satyrs bridle geese horn hare saddle duck fly goat thiller hart and other suchlike counterfeit picture at discretion to excite people unto laughter a silenus himself who be the fosterfather of good bacchus be wont to do but within those capricious casket be carefully preserve and keep many rich jewel and fine drug such a balm ambergris amomon musk civet with several kind of precious stone and other thing of great price just such another thing be socrates for to have eye hi outside and esteem of him by hi exterior appearance you would not have give the peel of an onion for him so deform he be in body and ridiculous in hi gesture he have a sharp pointed nose with the look of a bull and countenance of a fool he be in hi carriage simple boorish in hi apparel in fortune poor unhappy in hi wife unfit for all office in the commonwealth always laugh tipple and merrily carouse to everyone with continual gibe and jeer the good by those mean to conceal hi divine knowledge now open this box you would have find within it a heavenly and inestimable drug a more than human understand an admirable virtue matchless learn invincible courage unimitable sobriety certain contentment of mind perfect assurance and an incredible misregard of all that for which men commonly do so much watch run sail fight travel toil and turmoil themselves whereunto in your opinion doth this little flourish of a preamble tend for so much a you my good disciple and some other jolly fool of ease and leisure read the pleasant title of some book of our invention a gargantua pantagruel whippot fessepinte the dignity of codpiece of pea and bacon with a commentary c be too ready to judge that there be nothing in them but jest mockery lascivious discourse and recreative lie because the outside which be the title be usually without any farther inquiry entertain with scoffing and derision but truly it be very unbeseeming to make so slight account of the work of men see yourselves avouch that it be not the habit make the monk many be monasterially accoutre who inwardly be nothing less than monachal and that there be of those that wear spanish cape who have but little of the valour of spaniard in them therefore be it that you must open the book and seriously consider of the matter treat in it then shall you find that it containeth thing of far high value than the box do promise that be to say that the subject thereof be not so foolish a by the title at the first sight it would appear to be and put the case that in the literal sense you meet with purpose merry and solacious enough and consequently very correspondent to their inscription yet must not you stop there as at the melody of the charming syrens but endeavour to interpret that in a sublimer sense which possibly you intend to have speak in the jollity of your heart did you ever pick the lock of a cupboard to steal a bottle of wine out of it tell me truly and if you do call to mind the countenance which then you have or do you ever see a dog with a marrowbone in hi mouththe beast of all other say plato lib de republica the most philosophical if you have see him you might have remark with what devotion and circumspect he ward and watcheth it with what care he keep it how fervently he hold it how prudently he gobbets it with what affection he break it and with what diligence he suck it to what end all this what moveth him to take all these pain what be the hope of hi labour what doth he expect to reap thereby nothing but a little marrow true it be that this little be more savoury and delicious than the great quantity of other sort of meat because the marrow a galen testifieth facult nat de usu partium be a nourishment most perfectly elaboured by nature in imitation of this dog it become you to be wise to smell feel and have in estimation these fair goodly book stuff with high conception which though seemingly easy in the pursuit be in the cope and encounter somewhat difficult and then like him you must by a sedulous lecture and frequent meditation break the bone and suck out the marrowthat be my allegorical sense or the thing i to myself propose to be signify by these pythagorical symbol with assured hope that in so do you will at last attain to be both welladvised and valiant by the reading of them for in the perusal of this treatise you shall find another kind of taste and a doctrine of a more profound and abstruse consideration which will disclose unto you the most glorious sacrament and dreadful mystery as well in what concerneth your religion a matter of the public state and life economical do you believe upon your conscience that homer whilst he be acouching hi iliad and odysses have any thought upon those allegory which plutarch heraclides ponticus eustathius cornutus squeeze out of him and which politian filch again from them if you trust it with neither hand nor foot do you come near to my opinion which judgeth them to have be a little dreamed of by homer a the gospel sacrament be by ovid in hi metamorphosis though a certain gulligut friar frere lubin croquelardon and true baconpicker would have undertake to prove it if perhaps he have meet with as very fools a himself and a the proverb say a lid worthy of such a kettle if you give no credit thereto why do not you the same in these jovial new chronicle of mine albeit when i do dictate them i think upon no more than you who possibly be drink the whilst a i be for in the composing of this lordly book i never lose nor bestow any more nor any other time than what be appoint to serve me for take of my bodily refection that be whilst i be eat and drinking and indeed that be the fit and most proper hour wherein to write these high matter and deep science a homer know very well the paragon of all philologue and ennius the father of the latin poet a horace call him although a certain sneaking jobernol allege that hi verse smell more of the wine than oil so saith a turlupin or a new startup grub of my book but a turd for him the fragrant odour of the wine o how much more dainty pleasant laugh riant priant friant celestial and delicious it be than that smell of oil and i will glory as much when it be say of me that i have spend more on wine than oil a do demosthenes when it be tell him that hi expense on oil be great than on wine i truly hold it for an honour and praise to be call and repute a frolic gualter and a robin goodfellow for under this name be i welcome in all choice company of pantagruelists it be upbraid to demosthenes by an envious surly knave that hi oration do smell like the sarpler or wrapper of

hi dream of love set down more in france you have a taste of them in the device or impresa of my lord admiral which be carry before that time by octavian augustus but my little skiff alongst these unpleasant gulf and shoal will sail no further therefore must i return to the port from whence i come yet do i hope one day to write more at large of these thing and to show both by philosophical argument and authority receive and approve of by and from all antiquity what and how many colour there be in nature and what may be signify by every one of them if god save the mould of my cap which be my best winepot a my grandam say of that which be signify by the colour white and blue the white therefore signifieth joy solace and gladness and that not at random but upon just and very good ground which you may perceive to be true if laying aside all prejudicate affection you will but give ear to what presently i shall expound unto you aristotle saith that suppose two thing contrary in their kind a good and evil virtue and vice heat and cold white and black pleasure and pain joy and griefand so of othersif you couple them in such manner that the contrary of one kind may agree in reason with the contrary of the other it must follow by consequence that the other contrary must answer to the remanent opposite to that wherewith it be confer a for example virtue and vice be contrary in one kind so be good and evil if one of the contrary of the first kind be consonant to one of those of the second a virtue and goodness for it be clear that virtue be good so shall the other two contrary which be evil and vice have the same connection for vice be evil this logical rule be understood take these two contrary joy and sadness then these other two white and black for they be physically contrary if so be then that black do signify grief by good reason then should white import joy nor be this signification institute by human imposition but by the universal consent of the world receive which philosopher call jus gentium the law of nation or an uncontrollable right of force in all country whatsoever for you know well enough that all people and all language and nation except the ancient syracusans and certain argive who have cross and thwart soul when they mean outwardly to give evidence of their sorrow go in black and all mourning be do with black which general consent be not without some argument and reason in nature the which every man may by himself very suddenly comprehend without the instruction of anyand this we call the law of nature by virtue of the same natural instinct we know that by white all the world hath understood joy gladness mirth pleasure and delight in former time the thracian and cretan do mark their good propitious and fortunate day with white stone and their sad dismal and unfortunate one with black is not the night mournful sad and melancholic it be black and dark by the privation of light doth not the light comfort all the world and it be more white than anything els which to prove i could direct you to the book of laurentius valla against bartolus but an evangelical testimony i hope will content you matth it be say that at the transfiguration of our lord vestimenta ejus facta sunt alba sicut lux hi apparel be make white like the light by which lightsome whiteness he give hi three apostle to understand the idea and figure of the eternal joy for by the light be all men comfort accord to the word of the old woman who although she have never a tooth in her head be wont to say bona lux and tobit chap after he have lose hi sight when raphael salute him answer what joy can i have that do not see the light of heaven in that colour do the angel testify the joy of the whole world at the resurrection of our saviour john and at hi ascension act with the like colour of vesture do st john the evangelist apoc see the faithful clothe in the heavenly and bless jerusalem read the ancient both greek and latin history and you shall find that the town of alba the first pattern of rome be found and so name by reason of a white sow that be see there you shall likewise find in those story that when any man after he have vanquish hi enemy be by decree of the senate to enter into rome triumphantly he usually ride in a chariot drawn by white horse which in the ovation triumph be also the custom for by no sign or colour would they so significantly express the joy of their come a by the white you shall there also find how pericles the general of the athenian would need have that part of hi army unto whose lot befell the white bean to spend the whole day in mirth pleasure and ease whilst the rest be afighting a thousand other example and place could i allege to this purpose but that it be not here where i should do it by understand hereof you may resolve one problem which alexander aphrodiseus hath account unanswerable why the lion who with hi only cry and roar affright all beast dread and feareth only a white cock for a proclus saith libro de sacrificio et magia it be because the presence of the virtue of the sun which be the organ and promptuary of all terrestrial and sidereal light doth more symbolize and agree with a white cock as well in regard of that colour a of hi property and specifical quality than with a lion he saith furthermore that devil have be often see in the shape of lion which at the sight of a white cock have presently vanish this be the cause why galli or gallic so be the frenchman call because they be naturally white a milk which the greek call gala do willingly wear in their cap white feather for by nature they be of a candid disposition merry kind gracious and wellbeloved and for their cognizance and arm have the white flower of any the flower de luce or lily if you demand how by white nature would have u understand joy and gladness i answer that the analogy and uniformity be thus for a the white doth outwardly disperse and scatter the ray of the sight whereby the optic spirit be manifestly dissolve accord to the opinion of aristotle in hi problem and perspective treatise a you may likewise perceive by experience when you pass over mountain cover with snow how you will complain that you can not see well a xenophon write to have happen to hi men and a galen very largely declareth lib de usu partium just so the heart with excessive joy be inwardly dilate and suffereth a manifest resolution of the vital spirit which may go so far on that it may thereby be deprive of it nourishment and by consequence of life itself by this perichary or extremity of gladness a galen saith lib method lib de loci affectis and lib de symptomatum causis and a it hath come to pass in former time witness marcus tullius lib quaest tuscul verrius aristotle titus livius in hi relation of the battle of cannae plinius lib cap and a gellius lib c and many other writersto diagoras the rhodian chilon sophocles dionysius the tyrant of

you take of it excessively it will by a superfluous resolution and dilation deprive it altogether of life here peruse alex aphrodiseus lib probl cap and that for a cause but what it seem i be enter far into this point than i intend at the first here therefore will i strike sail refer the rest to that book of mine which handleth this matter to the full meanwhile in a word i will tell you that blue doth certainly signify heaven and heavenly thing by the same very token and symbol that white signifieth joy and pleasure of the youthful age of gargantua on the road to the castle gargantua from

feather after the switzers fashion afterwards in dung behind a bush i find a marchcat and with it i wipe my breech but her claw be so sharp that they scratch and exulcerated all my perinee of this i recover the next morning thereafter by wipe myself with my mother glove of a most excellent perfume and scent of the arabian benin after that i wipe me with sage with fennel with anet with marjoram with rose with gourdleaves with beet with colewort with leaf of the vinetree with mallow woolblade which be a tailscarlet with lettuce and with spinach leave all this do very great good to my leg then with mercury with parsley with nettle with comfrey but that give me the bloody flux of lombardy which i heal by wipe me with my braguette then i wipe my tail in the sheet in the coverlet in the curtain with a cushion with arras hanging with a green carpet with a tablecloth with a napkin with a handkerchief with a combingcloth in all which i find more pleasure than do the mangy dog when you rub them yea but say grangousier which torchecul do you find to be the best i be come to it say gargantua and byandby shall you hear the tu autem and know the whole mystery and knot of the matter i

some brave signor brought her to me i wait for inshitting i would have cleave her watergap and joind it close to my flipflap whilst she have with her finger guard my foul nockandrow all bemerded inshitting now say that i can do nothing by the merdi they be not of my make but i hear them of this good old grandam that you see here and ever since have retain them in the budget of my memory let u

none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose that be well down if you hold her head betwixt your leg and believe me therein upon mine honour for you will thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure both in regard of the softness of the say down and of the temporate heat of the goose which be easily communicate to the bumgut and the rest of the inwards in so far a to come even to the region of the heart and brain and think not that the felicity of the hero and demigod in the elysian field consisteth either in their asphodel ambrosia or nectar a our old woman here use to say but in this accord to my judgment that they wipe their tail with the neck of a goose hold her head betwixt their leg and such be the opinion of master john of scotland alias scotus how gargantua be teach latin by a sophist the good man grangousier have hear this discourse be ravish with admiration consider the high reach and marvellous understanding of hi son gargantua and say to hi governess philip king of macedon know the great wit of hi son alexander by hi skilful managing of a horse for hi horse bucephalus be so fierce and unruly that none durst adventure to ride him after that he have give to hi rider such devilish fall break the neck of this man the other man leg brain one and put another out of hi jawbone this by alexander be consider one day in the hippodrome which be a place appoint for the breaking and managing of great horse he perceive that the fury of the horse proceed merely from the fear he have of hi own shadow whereupon get on hi back he run him against the sun so that the shadow fell behind and by that mean tame the horse and bring him to hi hand whereby hi father know the divine judgment that be in him cause him most carefully to be instruct by aristotle who at that time be highly renowned above all the philosopher of greece after the same manner i tell you that by this only discourse which now i have here have before you with my son gargantua i know that hi understand doth participate of some divinity and that if he be well taught and have that education which be fit he will attain to a supreme degree of wisdom therefore will i commit him to some learn man to have him indoctrinate accord to hi capacity and will spare no cost presently they appoint him a great sophisterdoctor call master tubal holofernes who teach him hi abc so well that he could say it by heart backwards and about this he be five year and three month then read he to him donat le facet theodolet and alanus in parabolis about this he be thirteen year six month and two week but you must remark that in the mean time he do learn to write in gothic character and that he write all hi booksfor the art of printing be not then in useand do ordinarily carry a great pen and inkhorn weigh about seven thousand quintal that be pound weight the penner whereof be a big and as long a the great pillar of enay and the horn be hang to it in great iron chain it be of the wideness of a tun of merchant ware after that he read unto him the book de modis significandi with the commentary of hurtbise of fasquin of tropdieux of gualhaut of john calf of billonio of berlinguandus and a rabble of other and herein he spend more than eighteen year and eleven month and be so well verse in it that to try mastery in school dispute with hi condisciples he would recite it by heart backwards and do sometimes prove on hi fingerends to hi mother quod de modis significandi non erat scientia then do he read to him the compost for know the age of the moon the season of the year and tide of the sea on which he spend sixteen year and two month and that justly at the time that hi say preceptor die of the french pox which be in the year one thousand four hundred and twenty afterwards he get an old coughing fellow to teach him name master jobelin bride or muzzle dolt who read unto him hugutio hebrards grecism the doctrinal the part the quid est the supplementum marmotretus de moribus in mensa servandis seneca de quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus passavantus cum commento and dormi secure for the holiday and some other of such like mealy stuff by read whereof he become as wise a any we ever since bake in an oven how gargantua be put under other schoolmaster at the last hi father perceive that indeed he study hard and that although he spend all hi time in it he do nevertheless profit nothing but which be bad grow thereby foolish simple dot and blockish whereof make a heavy regret to don philip of marays viceroy or depute king of papeligosse he find that it be good for him to learn nothing at all than to be teach suchlike book under such schoolmaster because their knowledge be nothing but brutish and their wisdom but blunt foppish toy serve only to bastardize good and noble spirit and to corrupt all the flower of youth that it be so take say he any young boy of this time who hath only studied two yearsif he have not a well judgment a good discourse and that express in good term than your son with a completer carriage and civility to all manner of person account me for ever hereafter a very clounch and baconslicer of brene this pleased grangousier very well and he command that it should be do at night at supper the say de marays bring in a young page of hi of villegouges call eudemon so neat so trim so handsome in hi apparel so spruce with hi hair in so good order and so sweet and comely in hi behaviour that he have the resemblance of a little angel more than of a human creature then he say to grangousier do you see this young boy he be not a yet full twelve year old let u try if it please you what difference there be betwixt the knowledge of the dot mateologians of old time and the young lad that be now the trial please grangousier and he command the page to begin then eudemon ask leave of the viceking hi master so to do with hi cap in hi hand a clear and open countenance beautiful and ruddy lips hi eye steady and hi look fix upon gargantua with a youthful modesty stand up straight on hi foot begin very gracefully to commend him first for hi virtue and good manner secondly for hi knowledge thirdly for hi nobility fourthly for hi bodily accomplishment and in the fifth place most sweetly exhort him to reverence hi father with all due observancy who be so careful to have him well bring up in the end he pray him that he would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the least of hi servant for other favour at that time desire he none of heaven but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable service all this be by him deliver with such proper gesture such distinct pronunciation so pleasant a delivery in such exquisite fine term and so good latin that he seem rather a gracchus a cicero an aemilius of the time past than a youth of this age but all the countenance that gargantua keep be that he fell to cry like a cow and cast down hi face hide it with hi cap nor could they possibly draw one word from him no more than a fart from a dead as whereat hi father be so grievously vexed that he would have kill master jobelin but the say de marays withhold him from it by fair persuasion so that at length he pacify hi wrath then grangousier command he should be pay hi wage that they should whittle him up soundly like a sophist with good drink and then give him leave to go to all the devil in hell at least say he today shall it not cost hi host much if by chance he should die as drunk a a switzer master jobelin be go out of the house grangousier consult with the viceroy what schoolmaster they should choose for him and it be betwixt them resolve that ponocrates the tutor of eudemon should have the charge and that they should go altogether to paris to know what be the study of the young men of france at that time how gargantua be send to paris and of the huge great mare that he ride on how she destroy the oxflies of the beauce he go to see the city in the same season fayoles the fourth king of numidia send out of the country of africa to grangousier the most hideously great mare that ever be see and of the strange form for you know well enough how it be say that africa always be productive of some new thing she be as big a six elephant and have her foot cloven into finger like julius caesar horse with slouchhanging ear like the goat in languedoc and a little horn on her buttock she be of a burnt sorrel hue with a little mixture of dapplegrey spot but above all she have a horrible tail for it be little more or less than every whit as great a the steeplepillar of st mark beside lange and square a that be with tuff and ennicroches or hairplaits work within one another no otherwise than a the beard be upon the ear of corn if you wonder at this wonder rather at the tail of the scythian ram which weigh above thirty pound each and of the surian sheep who need if tenaud say true a little cart at their heel to bear up their tail it be so long and heavy you female lecher in the plain country have no such tail and she be bring by sea in three carricks and a brigantine unto the harbour of olone in thalmondois when grangousier saw her here be say he what be fit to carry my son to paris so now in the name of god all will be well he will in time come be a great scholar if it be not my master for the beast we should live like clerk the next morningafter they have drunk you must understandthey take their journey gargantua hi pedagogue ponocrates and hi train and with them eudemon the young page and because the weather be fair and temperate hi father cause to be make for him a pair of dun bootsbabin call them buskins thus do they merrily pass their time in travel on their high way always make good cheer and be very pleasant till they come a little above orleans in which place there be a forest of fiveandthirty league long and seventeen in breadth or thereabouts this forest be most horribly fertile and copious in dorflies hornet and wasp so that it be a very purgatory for the poor mare ass and horse but gargantua mare do avenge herself handsomely of all the outrage therein commit upon beast of her kind and that by a trick whereof they have no suspicion for as soon a ever they be enter into the say forest and that the wasp have give the assault she draw out and unsheathe her tail and therewith skirmishing do so sweep them that she overthrow all the wood alongst and athwart here and there this way and that way longwise and sidewise over and under and fell everywhere the wood with as much ease a a mower doth the grass in such sort that never since hath there be there neither wood nor dorflies for all the country be thereby reduce to a plain champaign field which gargantua take great pleasure to behold and say to hi company no more but this je trouve beau ce i find this pretty whereupon that country hath be ever since that time call beauce but all the breakfast the mare get that day be but a little yawning and gaping in memory whereof the gentleman of beauce do as yet to this day break their fast with gap which they find to be very good and do spit the good for it at last they come to paris where gargantua refresh himself two or three day make very merry with hi folk and inquire what men of learn there be then in the city and what wine they drink there how gargantua pay hi welcome to the parisian and how he take away the great bell of our lady church gargantua visit the shop some few day after that they have refresh themselves he go to see the city and be behold of everybody there with great admiration for the people of paris be so sottish so badot so foolish and fond by nature that a juggler a carrier of indulgence a sumpterhorse or mule with cymbal or tinkle bell a blind fiddler in the middle of a cross lane shall draw a great confluence of people together than an evangelical preacher and they press so hard upon him that he be constrain to rest himself upon the tower of our lady church at which place see so many about him he say with a loud voice i believe that these buzzard will have me to pay them here my welcome hither and my proficiat it be but good reason i will now give them their wine but it shall be only in sport then smile he untie hi fair braguette and draw out hi mentul into the open air he so bitterly alltobepissed them that he drown two hundred and sixty thousand four hundred and eighteen besides the woman and little child some nevertheless of the company escape this pissflood by mere speed of foot who when they be at the high end of the university sweat cough spitting and out of breath they begin to swear and curse some in good hot earnest and other in jest carimari carimara golynoly golynolo by my sweet sanctess we be wash in sport a sport truly to laugh atin french par ri for which that city hath be ever since call paris whose name formerly be leucotia a strabo testifieth lib quarto from the greek word leukotes whitenessbecause of the white thigh of the lady of that place and forasmuch a at this imposition of a new name all the people that be there swore everyone by the sancts of hi parish the parisian which be patch up of all nation and all piece of country be by nature both good juror and good jurist and somewhat overweening whereupon joanninus de barrauco libro de copiositate reverentiarum think that they be call parisian from the greek word parresia which signify boldness and liberty in speech this do he consider the great bell which be in the say tower and make them sound very harmoniously which whilst he be do it come into hi mind that they would serve very well for tingle tantans and ring campanels to hang about hi mare neck when she should be send back to hi father a he intend to do load with brie cheese and fresh herring and indeed he forthwith carry them to hi lodging in the meanwhile there come a master beggar of the friar of st anthony to demand in hi cant way the usual benevolence of some hoggish stuff who that he might be hear afar off and to make the bacon he be in quest of shake in the very chimneys make account to filch them away privily nevertheless he leave them behind very honestly not for that they be too hot but that they be somewhat too heavy for hi carriage this be not he of bourg for he be too good a friend of mine all the city be rise up in sedition they be a you know upon any slight occasion so ready to uproar and insurrection that foreign nation wonder at the patience of the king of france who do not by good justice restrain them from such tumultuous course see the manifold inconvenience which thence arise from day to day

the transporting of the bell after they have well ergot pro and con they conclude in baralipton that they should send the old and most sufficient of the faculty unto gargantua to signify unto him the

ponocrates and eudemon burst out in a laughing so heartily that they have almost split with it and give up the ghost in render their soul to god even just a crassus do see a lubberly as eat thistle and a philemon who for see an as eat those fig which be provide for hi own dinner die with force of laugh together with them master janotus fell alaughing too as fast a he could in which mood of laugh they continue so long that their eye do water by the vehement concussion of the substance of the brain by which these lachrymal humidity be press out glide through the optic nerve and so to the full represent democritus heraclitizing and heraclitus democritizing when they have do laugh gargantua consult with the prime of hi retinue what should be do there ponocrates be of opinion that they should make this fair orator drink again and see he have show them more pastime and make them laugh more than a natural soul could have do that they should give him ten basket full of sausage mention in hi pleasant speech with a pair of hose three hundred great billet of logwood fiveandtwenty hogshead of wine a good large downbed and a deep capacious dish which he say be necessary for hi old age all this be do a they do appoint only gargantua doubt that they could not quickly find out breech fit for hi wearing because he know not what fashion would best become the say orator whether the martingale fashion of breech wherein be a spunghole with a drawbridge for the more easy caguing or the fashion of the mariner for the great solace and comfort of hi kidney or that of the switzers which keep warm the bedondaine or bellytabret or round breech with straight cannions have in the seat a piece like a cod tail for fear of overheat hi reinsall which consider he cause to be give him seven ell of white cloth for the lining the wood be carry by the porter the master of art carry the sausage and the dish and master janotus himself would carry the cloth one of the say master call

thou dost not conclude in modo et figura for lo to this end serve the supposition and parva logicalia pannus pro quo supponit confuse say bandouille et distributive i do not ask thee say janotus blockhead quomodo supponit but pro quo it be blockhead pro tibiis mei and therefore i will carry it egomet sicut suppositum portat appositum so do he carry it away very close and covertly a patelin the buffoon do hi cloth the best be that when this cougher in a full act or assembly hold at the mathurins have with great confidence require hi breech and sausage and that they be flatly deny him because he have them of gargantua accord to the information thereupon make he show them that this be gratis and out of hi liberality by which they be not in any sort quit of their promise notwithstanding this it be answer him that he should be content with reason without expectation of any other bribe there reason say janotus we use none of it here unlucky traitor you be not worth the hang the earth beareth not more arrant villain than you be i know it well enough halt not before the lame i have practise wickedness with you by god rattle i will inform the king of the enormous abuse that be forge here and carry underhand by you and let me be a leper if he do not burn you alive like sodomite traitor heretic and seducer enemy to god and virtue upon these word they frame article against him he on the other side warn them to appear in sum the process be retain by the court and be there as yet hereupon the magisters make a vow never to decrott themselves in rub off the dirt of either their shoe or clothes master janotus with hi adherent vow never to blow or snuff their nose until judgment be give by a definitive sentence by these vow do they continue unto this time both dirty and snotty for the court hath not garble sift and fully look into all the piece a yet the judgment or decree shall be give out and pronounce at the next greek kalends that be never a you know that they do more than nature and contrary to their own article the article of paris maintain that to god alone belong infinity and nature produceth nothing that be immortal for she putteth an end and period to all thing by her engendered accord to the say omnia orta cadunt c but these thick mistswallowers make the suit in law depend before them both infinite and immortal in do whereof they have give occasion to and verify the saying of chilo the lacedaemonian consecrate to the oracle at delphos that misery be the inseparable companion of lawdebates and that pleader be miserable for sooner shall they attain to the end of their life than to the final decision of their pretended right the study of gargantua accord to the discipline of hi schoolmaster the sophist the first day be thus spend and the bell put up again in their own place the citizen of paris in acknowledgment of this courtesy offer to maintain and fee hi mare as long a he please which gargantua take in good part and they send her to graze in the forest of bier i think she be not there now this do he with all hi heart submit hi study to the discretion of ponocrates who for the beginning appoint that he should do a he be accustom to the end he might understand by what mean in so long time hi old master have make him so sottish and ignorant he dispose therefore of hi time in such fashion that ordinarily he do awake betwixt eight and nine oclock whether it be day or not for so have hi ancient governor ordain allege that which david saith vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere then do he tumble and toss wag hi leg and wallow in the bed some time the good to stir up and rouse hi vital spirit and apparel himself accord to the season but willingly he would wear a great long gown of thick frieze furred with foxskins afterwards he comb hi head with an almain comb which be the four finger and the thumb for hi preceptor say that to comb himself otherwise to wash and make himself neat be to lose time in this world then he dung pissed spew belch crack yawn spit coughed yexed sneeze and snot himself like an archdeacon and to suppress the dew and bad air go to breakfast have some good fried tripe fair rasher on the coal excellent gammon of bacon store of fine mince meat and a great deal of sippet brewis make up of the fat of the beefpot lay upon bread cheese and chop parsley strew together ponocrates show him that he ought not to eat so soon after rise out of hi bed unless he have perform some exercise beforehand gargantua answer what have not i sufficiently well exercise myself i have wallow and roll myself six or seven turn in my bed before i rise is not that enough pope alexander do so by the advice of a jew hi physician and live till hi die day in despite of hi enemy my first master have use me to it say that to breakfast make a good memory and therefore they drink first i be very well after it and dine but the good and master tubal who be the first licenciate at paris tell me that it be not enough to run apace but to set forth betimes so doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon perpetual drinking in a ribble rabble like duck but on drink early in the morning unde versus to rise betimes be no good hour to drink betimes be well sure after that he have thoroughly break hi fast he go to church and they carry to him in a great basket a huge impantoufled or thickcovered breviary weigh what in grease clasp parchment and cover little more or less than eleven hundred and six pound there he hear sixandtwenty or thirty mass this while to the same place come hi orisonmutterer impaletocked or lap up about the chin like a tufted whoop and hi breath pretty well antidoted with store of the vinetreesyrup with him he mumble all hi kiriels and dunsical breborions which he so curiously thumbed and finger that there fell not so much a one grain to the ground a he go from the church they bring him upon a dray drawn with ox a confused heap of paternoster and aves of st claude every one of them be of the bigness of a hatblock and thus walk through the cloister gallery or garden he say more in turn them over than sixteen hermit would have do then do he study some paltry halfhour with hi eye fix upon hi book but a the comic saith hi mind be in the kitchen piss then a full urinal he sit down at table and because he be naturally phlegmatic he begin hi meal with some dozen of gammon dry neat tongue hard roe of mullet call botargos andouilles or sausage and such other forerunner of wine in the meanwhile four of hi folk do cast into hi mouth one after another continually mustard by whole shovelful immediately after that he drink a horrible draught of white wine for the ease of hi kidney when that be do he eat accord to the season meat agreeable to hi appetite and then leave off eat when hi belly begin to strout and be like to crack for ful a for hi drinking he have in that neither end nor rule for he be wont to say that the limit and bound of drinking be when the cork of the shoe of him that drinketh swelleth up half a foot high the game of gargantua then blockishly mumble with a set on countenance a piece of scurvy grace he wash hi hand in fresh wine pick hi teeth with the foot of a hog and talk jovially with hi attendant then the carpet be spread they bring plenty of card many dice with great store and abundance of chequer and

time all the passage competent for this that be to be find in pliny athenaeus dioscorides julius pollux galen porphyry oppian polybius heliodore aristotle aelian and other whilst they talk of these thing many time to be the more certain they cause the very book to be bring to the table and so well and perfectly do he in hi memory retain the thing above say that in that time there be not a

whom he give a hundred carieres make him go the high saults bound in the air free the ditch with a skip leap over a stile or pale turn short in a ring both to the right and leave hand there he break not hi lance for it be the great foolery in the world to say i have break ten lance at tilt or in fight a carpenter can do even a much but it be a glorious and praiseworthy action with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemy therefore with a sharp stiff strong and wellsteeled lance would he usually force up a door pierce a harness beat down a tree carry away the ring lift up a cuirassier saddle with the mailcoat and gauntlet all this he do in complete arm from head to foot a for the prancing flourish and smack popisms for the good cherishing of the horse commonly use in rid none do them good than he the cavallerize of ferrara be but a an ape compare to him he be singularly skilful in leap nimbly from one horse to another without put foot to ground and these horse be call desultories he could likewise from either side with a lance in hi hand leap on horseback without stirrup and rule the horse at hi pleasure without a bridle for such thing be useful in military engagement another day he exercise the battleaxe which he so dexterously wield both in the nimble strong and smooth management of that weapon and that in all the feat practicable by it that he pass knight of arm in the field and at all essay then toss he the pike play with the twohanded sword with the backsword with the spanish tuck the dagger poniard arm unarmed with a buckler with a cloak with

with fist and foot he wrestle run jumpednot at three step and a leap call the hop nor at clochepied call the hare leap nor yet at the almains for say gymnast these jump be for the war altogether unprofitable and of no usebut at one leap he would skip over a ditch spring over a hedge mount six pace upon a wall ramp and grapple after this fashion up against a window of the full height of a lance he do swim in deep water on hi belly on hi back sideways with all hi body with hi foot only with one hand in the air wherein he hold a book cross thus the breadth of the river of seine without wet it and drag along hi cloak with hi teeth a do julius caesar then with the help of one hand he enter forcibly into a boat from whence he cast himself again headlong into the water sound the depth hollow the rock and plunge into the pit and gulf then turn he the boat about govern it lead it swiftly or slowly with the stream and against the stream stop it in hi course guide it with one hand and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great oar hoist the sail hie up along the mast by the shroud run upon the edge of the deck set the compass in order tackle the bowline and steer the helm come out of the water he run furiously up against a hill and with the same alacrity and swiftness run down again he climb up at tree like a cat and leap from the one to the other like a squirrel he do pull down the great bough and branch like another milo then with two sharp wellsteeled dagger and two tried bodkin would he run up by the wall to the very top of a house like a rat then suddenly come

partisan and the halbert he break the strong bow in draw bend against hi breast the great crossbow of steel take hi aim by the eye with the handgun and shot well traverse and plant the cannon shot at

by one end whereof hang near the ground he work himself with hi hand to the very top then upon the same track come down so sturdily and firm that you could not on a plain meadow have run with more assurance they set up a great pole fix upon two tree there would he hang by hi hand and with them alone hi foot touch at nothing would go back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftness that hardly could one overtake him with run and then to exercise hi breast and lung he would shout like all the devil in hell i hear him once call eudemon from st victor gate to montmartre stentor have never such a voice at the siege of troy then for the strengthening of hi nerve or sinew they make him two great sow of lead each of them weigh eight thousand and seven hundred quintal which they call alteres those he take up from the ground in each hand one then lift them up over hi head and hold them so without stir three quarter of an hour and more which be an inimitable force he fight at barrier with the stoutest and most vigorous champion and when it come to the cope he stand so sturdily on hi foot that he abandon himself unto the strong in case they could remove him from hi place a milo be wont to do of old in whose imitation likewise he hold a pomegranate in hi hand to give it unto him that could take it from him the time be thus bestow and himself rub cleanse wiped and refresh with other clothes he return fair and softly and pass through certain meadow or other grassy place behold the tree and plant compare them with what be write of them in the book of the ancient such a theophrast dioscorides marinus pliny nicander macer and galen and carry home to the house great handful of them whereof a young page call rizotomos have charge together with little mattock pickaxes grubbinghooks cabby pruningknives and other instrument requisite for herborizing being come to their lodging whilst supper be make ready they repeat certain passage of that which hath be read and sit down to table here remark that hi dinner be sober and thrifty for he do then eat only to prevent the gnawings of hi stomach but hi supper be copious and large for he take then as much a be fit to maintain and nourish him which indeed be the true diet prescribe by the art of good and sound physic although a rabble of loggerheaded physician nuzzeled in the brabbling shop of sophist counsel the contrary during that repast be continue the lesson read at dinner as long a they think good the rest be spend in good discourse learn and profitable after that they have give thanks he set himself to sing vocally and play upon harmonious instrument or otherwise pass hi time at some pretty sport make with card or dice or in practise the feat of legerdemain with cup and ball there they stay some night in frolic thus and make themselves merry till it be time to go to bed and on other night they would go make visit unto learn men or to such a have be traveller in strange and remote country when it be full night before they retire themselves they go unto the most open place of the house to see the face of the sky and there behold the comet if any be a likewise the figure situation aspect opposition and conjunction of both the fixed star and planet then with hi master do he briefly recapitulate after the manner of the pythagorean that which he have read see learn do and understand in the whole course of that day then pray they unto god the creator in fall down before him and strengthen their faith towards him and glorify him for hi boundless bounty and give thanks unto him for the time that be past they recommend themselves to hi divine clemency for the future which be do they go to bed and betook themselves to their repose and rest how gargantua spend hi time in rainy weather if it happen that the weather be anything cloudy foul and rainy all the forenoon be employ a before specify accord to custom with this difference only that they have a good clear fire light to correct the distemper of the air but after dinner instead of their wonted exercitations they do abide within and by way of apotherapy that be a make the body healthful by exercise do recreate themselves in bottle up of hay in cleave and saw of wood and in thresh sheaf of corn at the barn then they study the art of painting or carving or brought into use the antique play of table a leonicus hath write of it and a our good friend lascaris playeth at it in play they examine the passage of ancient author wherein the say play be mention or any metaphor drawn from it they go likewise to see the drawing of metal or the casting of great ordnance how the lapidary do work a also the goldsmith and cutter of precious stone nor do they omit to visit the alchemist moneycoiners upholsterer weaver velvetworkers watchmaker lookingglass framer printer organist and other such kind of artificer and everywhere give them somewhat to drink do learn and consider the industry and invention of the trade they go also to hear the public lecture the solemn commencements the repetition the acclamation the pleading of the gentle lawyer and sermon of evangelical preacher he go through the hall and place appoint for fencing and there play against the master themselves at all weapon and show them by experience that he know as much in it a yea more than they and instead of herborizing they visit the shop of druggist herbalist and apothecary and diligently consider the fruit root leave gum seed the grease and ointment of some foreign part a also how they do adulterate them he go to see the juggler tumbler mountebank and quacksalvers and consider their cunning their shift their somersault and smooth tongue especially of those of chauny in picardy who be naturally great prater and brave giver of fib in matter of green ape at their return they do eat more soberly at supper than at other time and meat more desiccative and extenuate to the end that the intemperate moisture of the air communicate to the body by a necessary confinitive might by this mean be correct and that they might not receive any prejudice for want of their ordinary bodily exercise thus be gargantua govern and keep on in this course of education from day to day profit a you may understand such a young man of hi age may of a pregnant judgment with good discipline well continue which although at the begin it seem difficult become a little after so sweet so easy and so delightful that it seem rather the recreation of a king than the study of a scholar nevertheless ponocrates to divert him from this vehement intension of the spirit think fit once in a month upon some fair and clear day to go out of the city betimes in the morning either towards gentilly or boulogne or to montrouge or charanton bridge or to vanves or st clou and there spend all the day long in make the great cheer that could be devise sport make merry drink healths play sing dance tumble in some fair meadow unnestling of sparrow take of quail and fishing for frog and crab but although that day be pass without book or lecture yet be it not spend without profit for in the say meadow they usually repeat certain pleasant verse of virgil agriculture of hesiod and of politians husbandry would set abroach some witty latin epigram then immediately turn them into roundelay and song for dance in the french language in their feasting they would sometimes separate the water from the wine that be therewith mixed a cato teacheth de re rustica and pliny with an ivy cup would wash the wine in a basinful of water then take it out again with a funnel as pure a ever they make the water go from one glass to another and contrive a thousand little automatory engine that be to say moving of themselves how there be great strife and debate raise betwixt the cakebakers of lerne and those of gargantua country whereupon be wag great war at that time which be the season of vintage in the beginning of harvest when the country shepherd be set to keep the vine and hinder the starling from eat up the grape a some cakebakers of lerne happen to pass along in the broad highway drive into the city ten or twelve horse load with cake the say shepherd courteously entreat them to give them some for their money a the price then rule in the market for here it be to be remark that it be a celestial food to eat for breakfast hot fresh cake with grape especially the frail cluster the great red grapes the muscadine the verjuice grape and the laskard for those that be costive in their belly because it will make them gush out and squirt the length of a hunter staff like the very tap of a barrel and oftentimes think to let a squib they do alltobesquatter and conskite themselves whereupon they be commonly call the vintage thinkers the bunsellers or cakemakers be in nothing inclinable to their request but which be bad do injure them most outrageously call them prattle gabblers lickorous glutton freckle bittors mangy rascal shiteabed scoundrel

other suchlike defamatory epithet say far that it be not for them to eat of these dainty cake but might very well content themselves with the coarse unranged bread or to eat of the great brown household loaf to which provoke word one amongst them call forgier an honest fellow of hi person and a notable springal make answer very calmly thus how long be it since you have get horn that you be become so proud indeed formerly you be wont to give u some freely and will you not now let u have any for our money this be not the part of good neighbour neither do we serve you thus when you come hither to buy our good corn whereof you make your cake and bun besides that we would have give you to the bargain some of our grape but by hi zounds you may chance to repent it and possibly have need of u at another time when we shall use you after the like manner and therefore remember it then marquet a prime man in the confraternity of the cakebakers say unto him yea sir thou art pretty well crestrisen this morning thou didst eat yesternight too much millet and bolymong come hither sirrah come hither i will give thee some cake whereupon forgier dread no harm in all simplicity go towards him and draw a sixpence out of hi leather satchel think that marquet would have sell him some of hi cake but instead of cake he give him with hi whip such a rude lash overthwart the leg that the mark of the whipcord knot be apparent in them then would have flee away but forgier cry out as loud a he could o murder murder help help help and in the meantime throw a great cudgel after him which he carry under hi arm wherewith he hit him in the coronal joint of hi head upon the crotaphic artery of the right side thereof so forcibly that marquet fell down from hi mare more like a dead than live man meanwhile the farmer and country swain that be watch their walnut near to that place come run with their great pole and long stave and lay such load on these cakebakers a if they have be to thresh upon green rye the other shepherd and shepherdess hear the lamentable shout of forgier come with their sling and slackies follow them and throw great stone at them as thick a if it have be hail at last they overtake them and take from them about four or five dozen of their cake nevertheless they pay for them the ordinary price and give them over and above one hundred egg and three basket full of mulberry then do the cakebakers help to get up to hi mare marquet who be most shrewdly wound and forthwith return to lerne change the resolution they have to go to pareille threaten very sharp and boisterously the cowherd shepherd and farmer of seville and sinays this do the shepherd and shepherdess make merry with these cake and fine grape and sport themselves together at the sound of the pretty small pipe scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cakebakers who have that day meet with a mischief for want of cross themselves with a good hand in the morning nor do they forget to apply to forgiers leg some fair great red medicinal grape and so handsomely dress it and bind it up that he be quickly cure how the inhabitant of lerne by the commandment of picrochole their king assault the shepherd of gargantua unexpectedly and on a sudden the cakebakers be return to lerne go presently before they do either eat or drink to the capitol and there before their king call picrochole the third of that name make their complaint show their pannier break their cap all crumple their coat tear their cake take away but above all marquet most enormously wound say that all that mischief be do by the shepherd and herdsman of grangousier near the broad highway beyond seville picrochole incontinent grow angry and furious and without ask any further what how why or wherefore command the ban and arriere ban to be sound throughout all hi country that all hi vassal of what condition soever should upon pain of the halter come in the best arm they could unto the great place before the castle at the hour of noon and the good to strengthen hi design he cause the drum to be beat about the town himself whilst hi dinner be make ready go to see hi artillery mount upon the carriage to display hi colour and set up the great royal standard and load wain with store of ammunition both for the field and the belly arm and victual at dinner he despatch hi commission and by hi express edict my lord shagrag be appoint to command the vanguard wherein be number sixteen thousand and fourteen arquebusiers or firelock together with thirty thousand and eleven volunteer adventurer the great touquedillon master of the horse have the charge of the ordnance wherein be reckon nine hundred and fourteen brazen piece in cannon double cannon basilisks serpentines culverin bombard or murderer falcon base or passevolins spirols and other sort of great gun the rearguard be commit to the duke of scrapegood in the main battle be the king and the prince of hi kingdom thus be hastily furnish before they would set forward they send three hundred light horseman under the conduct of captain swillwind to discover the country clear the avenue and see whether there be any ambush lay for them but after they have make diligent search they find all the land round about in peace and quiet without any meeting or convention at all which picrochole understanding command that everyone should march speedily under hi colour then immediately in all disorder without keep either rank or file they take the field one amongst another waste spoil destroying and make havoc of all wherever they go not spar poor nor rich privilege or unprivileged place church nor laity drive away oxen and cow bull calve heifer wether ewes lambs goat kid hen capon chicken geese gander gosling hog swine pig and such like beat down the walnut pluck the grape tear the hedge shake the fruittrees and commit such incomparable abuse that the like abomination be never hear of nevertheless they meet with none to resist them for everyone submit to their mercy beseech them that they might be deal with courteously in regard that they have always carry themselves a become good and loving neighbour and that they have never be guilty of any wrong or outrage do upon them to be thus suddenly surprised troubled and disquieted and that if they would not desist god would punish them very shortly to which expostulation and remonstrance no other answer be make but that they would teach them to eat cake how a monk of seville save the close of the abbey from be ransack by the enemy the monk knew not so much they do and so far they go pillage and steal that at last they come to seville where they rob both men and woman and take all they could catch nothing be either too hot or too heavy for them although the plague be there in the most part of all the house they nevertheless enter everywhere then plunder and carry away all that be within and yet for all this not one of them take any hurt which be a most wonderful case for the curate vicars preacher physician chirurgeons and apothecary who go to visit to dress to cure to heal to preach unto and admonish those that be sick be all dead of the infection and these devilish robber and murderer catch never any harm at all whence come this to pass my master i beseech you think upon it the town be thus pillage they go unto the abbey with a horrible noise and tumult but they find it shut and make fast against them whereupon the body of the army march forward towards a pas or ford call the gue de vede except seven company of foot and two hundred lancer who stay there break down the wall of the close to waste spoil and make havoc of all the vine and vintage within that place the monk poor devil know not in that extremity to which of all their sancts they should vow themselves nevertheless at all adventure they ring the bell ad capitulum capitulantes there it be decree that they should make a fair procession stuffed with good lecture prayer and litany contra hostium insidias and jolly response pro pace there be then in the abbey a claustral monk call friar john of the funnel and gobbet in french de entoumeures young gallant frisk lusty nimble quick active bold adventurous resolute tall lean widemouthed longnosed a fair despatch of morning prayer unbridler of mass and runner over of vigil and to conclude summarily in a word a right monk if ever there be any since the monk world monk a monkery for the rest a clerk even to the teeth in matter of breviary this monk hear the noise that the enemy make within the enclosure of the vineyard go out to see what they be do and perceive that they be cut and gather the grape whereon be ground the foundation of all their next year wine return unto the choir of the church where the other monk be all amaze and astonish like so many bellmelters whom when he hear sing im nim pe ne ne ne ne nene tum ne num num ini i mi co o no o o neno ne no no no rum nenum num it be well shit well sung say he by the virtue of god why do not you sing pannier farewell vintage be do the devil snatch me if they be not already within the middle of our close and cut so well both vine and grape that by cod body there will not be find for these four year to come so much a a gleaning in it by the belly of sanct james what shall we poor devil drink the while lord god da mihi potum then say the prior of the convent what should this drunken fellow do here let him be carry to prison for trouble the divine service nay say the monk the wine service let u behave ourselves so that it be not troubled for you yourself my lord prior love to drink of the best and so doth every honest man never yet do a man of worth dislike good wine it be a monastical apophthegm but these response that you chant here by g be not in season wherefore be it that our devotion be institute to be short in the time of harvest and vintage and long in the advent and all the winter the late friar massepelosse of good memory a true zealous man or els i give myself to the devil of our religion tell me and i remember it well how the reason be that in this season we might press and make the wine and in winter whiff it up hark you my master you that love the wine cop body follow me for sanct anthony burn me as freely a a faggot if they get leave to taste one drop of the liquor that will not now come and fight for relief of the vine hog belly the good of the church ha no no what the devil sanct thomas of england be well content to die for them if i die in the same cause should not i be a sanct likewise yes yet shall not i die there for all this for it be i that must do it to other and send them apacking a he spake this he throw off hi great monk habit and laid hold upon the staff of the cross which be make of the heart of a sorbappletree it be of the length of a lance round of a full grip and a little powdered with lily call flower de luce the workmanship whereof be almost all defaced and worn out thus go he out in a fair longskirted jacket put hi frock scarfwise athwart hi breast and in this equipage with hi staff shaft or truncheon of the cross laid on so lustily brisk and fiercely upon hi enemy who without any order or ensign or trumpet or drum be busy in gather the grape of the vineyard for the cornet guidons and ensignbearers have lay down their standard banner and colour by the wall side the drummer have knock out the head of their drum on one end to fill them with grape the trumpeter be load with great bundle of bunch and huge knot of cluster in sum everyone of them be out of array and all in disorder he hurry therefore upon them so rudely without cry gare or beware that he overthrow them like hog tumble them over like swine strike athwart and alongst and by one mean or other lay so about him after the old fashion of fence that to some he beat out their brain to other he crush their arm batter their leg and bethwacked their side till their rib crack with it to other again he unjointed the spondyles or knuckle of the neck disfigure their chap gash their face make their cheek hang flap on their chin and so swinged and balammed them that they fell down before him like hay before a mower to some other he spoil the frame of their kidney mar their back break their thighbone pashed in their nose poach out their eye cleave their mandible tear their jaw dung in their teeth into their throat shook asunder their omoplates or shoulderblades sphacelate their shin mortify their shank inflame their ankle heave off of the hinge their ishies their sciatica or hipgout dislocate the joint of their knee squatter into piece the bought or pestle of their thigh and so thumped maul and belabour them everywhere that never be corn so thick and threefold thresh upon by ploughman flail a be the pitifully disjointed member of their mangled body under the merciless baton of the cross if any offer to hide himself amongst the thickest of the vine he lay him squat a a flounder bruise the ridge of hi back and dash hi rein like a dog if any think by flight to escape he make hi head to fly in piece by the lamboidal commissure which be a seam in the hinder part of the skull if anyone do scramble up into a tree thinking there to be safe he rent up hi perinee and impale him in at the fundament if any of hi old acquaintance happen to cry out ha friar john my friend friar john quarter quarter i yield myself to you to you i render myself so thou shalt say he and must whether thou wouldst or no and withal render and yield up thy soul to all the devil in hell then suddenly give them dronos that be so many knock thump raps dint thwack and bang a suffice to warn pluto of their coming and despatch them ago if any be so rash and full of temerity a to resist him to hi face then be it he do show the strength of hi muscle for without more ado he do transpierce him by run him in at the breast through the mediastine and the heart other again he so quash and bebumped that with a sound bounce under the hollow of their short rib he overturn their stomach so that they die immediately to some with a smart souse on the epigaster he would make their midriff swag then redouble the blow give them such a homepush on the navel that he make their pudding to gush out to other through their ballock he pierce their bumgut and leave not bowel tripe nor entrail in their body that have not felt the impetuosity fierceness and fury of hi violence believe that it be the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw some cry unto sanct barb other to st george o the holy lady nytouch say one the good sanctess o our lady of succour say another help help other cry our lady of cunaut of loretto of good tidings on the other side of the water st mary over some vow a pilgrimage to st james and other to the holy handkerchief at chamberry which three month after that burnt so well in the fire that they could not get one thread of it save other send up their vow to st cadouin other to st john dangely and to st eutropius of xaintes other again invoke st mesmes of chinon st martin of candes st clouaud of sinays the holy relic of laurezay with a thousand other jolly little sancts and santrels some die without speak other speak without die some die in speak other speak in die other shout as loud a they could confession confession confiteor miserere in manus so great be the cry of the wounded that the prior of the abbey with all hi monk come forth who when they saw these poor wretch so slain amongst the vine and wound to death confess some of them but whilst the priest be busy in confess them the little monkies run all to the place where friar john be and ask him wherein he would be please to require their assistance to which he answer that they should cut the throat of those he have throw down upon the ground they presently leave their outer habit and cowl upon the rail begin to throttle and make an end of those whom he have already crush can you tell with what instrument they do it with fair gully which be little hulchbacked demiknives the iron tool whereof be two inch long and the wooden handle one inch thick and three inch in length wherewith the little boy in our country cut ripe walnut in two while they be yet in the shell and pick out the kernel and they find them very fit for the expediting of that weasandslitting exploit in the meantime friar john with hi formidable baton of the cross get to the breach which the enemy have make and there stand to snatch up those that endeavour to escape some of the monkitos carry the standard banner ensigns guidons and colour into their cell and chamber to make garter of them but when those that have be shriven would have go out at the gap of the say breach the sturdy monk quash and fell them down with blow say these men have have confession and be penitent soul they have get their absolution and gain the pardon they go into paradise as straight a a sickle or a the way be to fay like crookedlane at eastcheap

admit to speak with the king of somewhat that concern him these word be tell unto the king he would by no mean consent that they should open the gate but get upon the top of the bulwark say unto the

when they receive hurt and damage where they may justly expect for favour and good will and not without cause though without reason have many after they have fall into such a calamitous accident esteem this indignity less supportable than the loss of their own life in such sort that if they have not be able by force of arm nor any other mean by reach of wit or subtlety to stop them in their course and restrain their fury they have fall into desperation and utterly deprive themselves of this light it be therefore no wonder if king grangousier my master be full of high displeasure and much disquiet in mind upon thy outrageous and hostile come but truly it would be a marvel if he be not sensible of and move with the incomparable abuse and injury perpetrate by thee and thine upon those of hi country towards whom there hath be no example of inhumanity omit which in itself be to him so grievous for the cordial affection wherewith he hath always cherish hi subject that more it can not be to any mortal man yet in this above human apprehension be it to him the more grievous that these wrong and sad offence have be commit by thee and thine who time out of mind from all antiquity thou and thy predecessor have be in a continual league and amity with him and all hi ancestor which even until this time you have as sacred together inviolably preserve kept and entertain so well that not he and hi only but the very barbarous nation of the poictevins breton manceaux and those that dwell beyond the isle of the canary and that of isabella have think it a easy to pull down the firmament and to set up the depth above the cloud a to make a breach in your alliance and have be so afraid of it in their enterprise that they have never dare to provoke incense or endamage the one for fear of the other nay which be more this sacred league hath so fill the world that there be few nation at this day inhabit throughout all the continent and isle of the ocean who have not ambitiously aspire to be receive into it upon your own covenant and condition hold your joint confederacy in as high esteem a their own territory and dominion in such sort that from the memory of man there hath not be either prince or league so wild and proud that durst have offer to invade i say not your country but not so much a those of your confederate and if by rash and heady counsel they have attempt any new design against them as soon a they hear the name and title of your alliance they have suddenly desist from their enterprise what rage and madness therefore doth now incite thee all old alliance infringe all

reason where be humanity where be the fear of god dost thou think that these atrocious abuse be hide from the eternal spirit and the supreme god who be the just reward of all our undertaking if thou so think thou deceivest thyself for all thing shall come to pass a in hi incomprehensible judgment he hath appoint be it thy fatal destiny or influence of the star that would put an end to thy so long enjoyed ease and rest for that all thing have their end and period so a that when they be come to the superlative point of their great height they be in a trice tumble down again a not be able to

now come to an end must it need be by wrong my kinghim by whom thou wert establish if thy house must come to ruin should it therefore in it fall crush the heel of him that set it up the matter be so unreasonable and so dissonant from common sense that hardly can it be conceive by human understanding and altogether incredible unto stranger till by the certain and undoubted effect thereof it be make apparent that nothing be either sacred or holy to those who have emancipate themselves from god and reason do merely follow the perverse affection of their own deprave nature if any wrong have be

incredible news of the enormous abuse thus commit over all the land so affrighted gargantua that he know not what to say nor do but ponocrates counsel him to go unto the lord of vauguyon who at all time have be their friend and confederate and that by him they should be good advise in their business which they do incontinently and find him very willing and fully resolve to assist them and therefore be of opinion that they should send some one of hi company to scout along and discover the country to learn in what condition and posture the enemy be that they might take counsel and proceed accord to the present occasion gymnast offer himself to go whereupon it be conclude that for hi safety and the good expedition he should have with him someone that know the way avenues turning winding and river thereabout then away go he and prelingot the equerry or gentleman of vauguyons horse who scout and espy as narrowly a they could upon all quarter without any fear in the meantime gargantua take a little refreshment ate somewhat himself the like do those who be with him and cause to give to hi mare a picotine of oat that be three score and fourteen quarter and three bushel

a poor devil it be reason that thou shouldst be permit to go whithersoever thou wilt for all poor devil pass everywhere without toll or tax but it be not the custom of poor devil to be so well mount therefore sir devil come down and let me have your horse and if he do not carry me well you master devil must do it for i love a life that such a devil a you should carry me away how gymnast very souply and cunningly kill captain tripet and other of picrocholes men when they hear these word some amongst them begin to be afraid and bless themselves with both hand think indeed that he have be a devil disguise insomuch that one of them name good john captain of the trained band of the country bumpkins take hi psalter out of hi codpiece and cry out aloud hagios ho theos if thou be of god speak if thou be of the other spirit avoid hence and get thee go yet he go not away which word be hear by all the soldier that be there diver of them be a little inwardly terrify depart from the place all this do gymnast very well remark and consider and therefore making a if he would have alight from off hi horse a he be poise himself on the mounting side he most nimbly with hi short sword by hi thigh shift hi foot in the stirrup perform the stirrupleather feat whereby after the inclining of hi body downwards he forthwith launch himself aloft in the air and place both hi foot together on the saddle standing upright with hi back turn towards the horse head now say he my case go backward then suddenly in the same very posture wherein he be he fetch a gambol upon one foot and turn to the left hand fail not to carry hi body perfectly round just into it former stance without miss one jot ha say tripet i will not do that at this time and not without cause well say gymnast i have fail i will undo this leap then with a marvellous strength and agility turning towards the right hand he fetch another frisk gambol a before which do he set hi righthand thumb upon the hindbow of the saddle raise himself up and sprung in the air poising and uphold hi whole body upon the muscle and nerve of the say thumb and so turned and whirl himself about three time at the fourth reverse hi body and overturn it upside down and foreside back without touch anything he bring himself betwixt the horse two ear spring with all hi body into the air upon the thumb of hi left hand and in that posture turn like a windmill do most actively do that trick which be call the miller pass after this clap hi right hand flat upon the middle of the saddle he give himself such a jerking swing that he thereby seat himself upon the crupper after the manner of gentlewoman sit on horseback this do he easily pass hi right leg over the saddle and place himself like one that rid in croup but say he it be good for me to get into the saddle then put the thumb of both hand upon the crupper before him and thereupon lean himself a upon the only supporter of hi body he incontinently turn heel over head in the air and straight find himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a good settlement then with a somersault spring into the air again he fell to stand with both hi foot close together upon the saddle and there make above a hundred frisk turn and demipommads with hi arm hold out across and in so do cry out aloud i rage i rage devil i be stark mad devil i be mad hold me devil hold me hold devil hold hold whilst he be thus vault the rogue in great astonishment say to one another by cock death he be a goblin or a devil thus disguise ab host maligno libera nos domine and run away in a full flight a if they have be rout look now and then behind them like a dog that carrieth away a goosewing in hi mouth then gymnast spy hi advantage alight from hi horse draw hi sword and laid on great blow upon the thickset and high crest among them and overthrow them in great heap hurt wound and bruise be resist by nobody they think he have be a starved devil as well in regard of hi wonderful feat in vault which they have see a for the talk tripet have with him call him poor devil only tripet would have traitorously cleave hi head with hi horseman sword or lanceknight falchion but he be well arm and felt nothing of the blow but the weight of the stroke whereupon turn suddenly about he give tripet a homethrust and upon the back of that whilst he be about to ward hi head from a slash he run him in at the breast with a hit which at once cut hi stomach the fifth gut call the colon and the half of hi liver wherewith he fell to the ground and in fall gushed forth above four pottle of pottage and hi soul mingle with the pottage this do gymnast withdraw himself very wisely consider that a case of great adventure and hazard should not be pursue unto it utmost period and that it become all cavalier modestly to use their good fortune without trouble or stretch it too far wherefore get to horse he give him the spur take the right way unto vauguyon and prelinguand with him how gargantua demolish the castle at the ford of vede and how they pass the ford how gargantua pass the ford a soon a he come he relate the estate and condition wherein they have find the enemy and the stratagem which he alone have use against all their multitude affirm that they be but rascally rogues plunderer thief and robber ignorant of all military discipline and that they might boldly set forward unto the field it be an easy matter to fell and strike them down like beast then gargantua mount hi great mare accompany a we have say before and find in hi way a high and great tree which commonly be call by the name of st martin tree

night be afraid of the enemy have hide themselves in the garden upon the chichling pea among the cabbage and lettuce gargantua find himself somewhat dry ask whether they could get any lettuce to make him a salad and hearing that there be the great and fair in the country for they be as great a plumtrees or a walnuttrees he would go thither himself and bring thence in hi hand what he think good and withal carry away the six pilgrim who be in so great fear that they do not dare to speak nor cough washing them therefore first at the fountain the pilgrim say one to another softly what shall we do we be almost drown here amongst these lettuce shall we speak but if we speak he will kill u for spy and a they be thus deliberate what to do gargantua put them with the lettuce into a platter of the house as large a the huge tun of the white friar of the cistercian order which do with oil vinegar and salt he eat them up to refresh himself a little before supper and have already swallow up five of the pilgrim the sixth be in the platter totally hid under a lettuce except hi bourdon or staff that appear and nothing els which grangousier see say to gargantua i think that be the horn of a shellsnail do not eat it why not say gargantua they be good all this month which he no sooner say but draw up the staff and therewith take up the pilgrim he eat him very well then drink a terrible draught of excellent white wine the pilgrim thus devour make shift to save themselves as well a they could by withdraw their body out of the reach of the grinder of hi teeth but could not escape from think they have be put in the low dungeon of a prison and when gargantua whiff the great draught they think to have be drown in hi mouth and the flood of wine have almost carry them away into the gulf of hi stomach nevertheless skip with their bourdon a st michael palmer use to do they shelter themselves from the danger of that inundation under the bank of hi teeth but one of them by chance groping or sound the country with hi staff to try whether they be in safety or no struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth and hit the mandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw which put gargantua to very great pain so that he begin to cry for the rage that he felt to ease himself therefore of hi smart ache he call for hi toothpick and rubbing towards a young walnuttree where they lay skulk unnestled

somewhat stay their stomach by a snatch or two of the first bit eat heartily grangousier begin to relate the source and cause of the war raise between him and picrochole and come to tell how friar john of the funnel have triumph at the defence of the close of the abbey and extol him for hi valour above camillus scipio pompey caesar and themistocles then gargantua desire that he might be

grangousiers mule when he be come a thousand hugging a thousand embracements a thousand good day be give ha friar john my friend friar john my brave cousin friar john from the devil let me clip thee

of a nun doth not he die like a good fellow that die with a stiff catso our prior love exceedingly the white of a capon in that say gymnast he doth not resemble the fox for of the capon hen and pullet which they carry away they never eat the white why say the monk because say gymnast they have no cook to dress them and if they be not competently make ready they remain red and not white the redness of meat be a token that they have not get enough of the fire whether by boil roast or otherwise except the shrimps lobster crab and crayfish which be cardinalized with boiling by god feastgazers say the monk the porter of our abbey then hath not hi head well boil for hi eye be as red a a mazer make of an aldertree the thigh of this leveret be good for those that have the gout to the purpose of the truelwhat be the reason that the thigh of a gentlewoman be always fresh and cool this problem say gargantua be neither in aristotle in alexander aphrodiseus nor in plutarch there be three cause say the monk by which that place be naturally refresh primo because the water run all along by it secundo because it be a shady place obscure and dark upon which the sun never shine and thirdly because it be continually flabbelled blow upon and air by the north wind of the hole arstick the fan of the smock and flipflap of the codpiece and lusty my lad some bouse liquor page so crack crack crack o how good be god that give u of this excellent juice i call him to witness if i have be in the time of jesus christ i would have keep him from be take by the jew in the garden of olivet and the devil fail me if i should have fail to cut off the ham of these gentleman apostle who run away so basely after they have well sup and leave their good master in the lurch i hate that man bad than poison that offer to run away when he should fight and lay stoutly about him oh that i be but king of france for fourscore or a hundred year by g i should whip like curtaildogs these runaway of pavia a plague take them why do they not choose rather to die there than to leave their good prince in that pinch and necessity be it not well and more honourable to perish in fight valiantly than to live in disgrace by a cowardly run away we be like to eat no great store of gosling this year therefore friend reach me some of that roast pig there diavolo be there no more must no more sweet wine germinavit radix jesse je renie ma vie je meurs de soif i renounce my life i rage for thirst this wine be none of the bad what wine drink you at paris i give myself to the devil if i do not once keep open house at paris for all comer six month together do you know friar claude of the high kilderkin oh the good fellow that he be but i do not know what fly hath stung him of late he be become so hard a student for my part i study not at all in our abbey we never study for fear of the mumps which disease in horse be call the mourning in the chine our late abbot be wont to say that it be a monstrous thing to see a learn monk by g master my friend magi magnos clericos non sunt magi magnos sapient you never saw so many hare a there be this year i could not anywhere come by a goshawk nor tassel of falcon my lord belloniere promise me a lanner but he write to me not long ago that he be become pursy the partridge will so multiply henceforth that they will go near to eat up our ear i take no delight in the stalkinghorse for i catch such cold that i be like to founder myself at that sport if i do not run toil travel and trot about i be not well at ease true it be that in leap over the hedge and bush my frock leave always some of it wool behind it i have recover a dainty greyhound i give him to the devil if he suffer a hare to escape him a groom be lead him to my lord huntlittle and i rob him of him did i ill no friar john say gymnast no by all the devil that be no so say the monk do i attest these same devil so long a they last or rather virtue of g what could that gouty limpard have do with so fine a dog by the body of g he be well pleased when one present him with a good yoke of oxen how now say ponocrates you swear friar john it be only say the monk but to grace and adorn my speech they be colour of a ciceronian rhetoric why monk be the outcast of the world and wherefore some have big nose than other by the faith of a christian say eudemon i do wonderfully dote and enter in a great ecstasy when i consider the honesty and good fellowship of this monk for he make u here all merry how be it then that they exclude the monk from all good company call them feasttroublers marrers of mirth and disturber of all civil conversation a the bee drive away the drone from their hive ignavum fucos pecus say maro a praesepibus arcent hereunto answer gargantua there be nothing so true a that the frock and cowl draw unto itself the opprobries injury and malediction of the world just a the wind call cecias attract the cloud the peremptory reason be because they eat the ordure and excrement of the world that be to say the sin of the people and like dungchewers and excrementitious eater they be cast into the privy and secessive place that be the convent and abbey separate from political conversation a the jakes and retreat of a house be but if you conceive how an ape in a family be always mock and provokingly incense you shall easily apprehend how monk be shun of all men both young and old the ape keep not the house a a dog doth he draw not in the plough a the ox he yield neither milk nor wool a the sheep he carrieth no burden a a horse doth that which he doth be only to conskite spoil and defile all which be the cause wherefore he hath of all men mock frumperies and bastinado after the same manner a monki mean those lithe idle lazy monksdoth not labour and work as do the peasant and artificer doth not ward and defend the country a doth the man of war cureth not the sick and diseased a the physician doth doth neither preach nor teach a do the evangelical doctor and schoolmaster doth not import commodity and thing necessary for the commonwealth a the merchant doth therefore be it that by and of all men they be hoot at hat and abhor yea but say grangousier they pray to god for u nothing less answered gargantua true it be that with a tingle tangle jangling of bell they trouble and disquiet all their neighbour about them right say the monk a mass a matin a vesper well rung be half say they mumble out great store of legend and psalm by them not at all understood they say many paternoster interlard with avemaries without think upon or apprehend the meaning of what it be they say which truly i call mock of god and not prayer but so help them god a they pray for u and not for be afraid to lose their victual their manchots and good fat pottage all true christian of all estate and condition in all place and at all time send up their prayer to god and the mediator prayeth and intercedeth for them and god be gracious to them now such a one be our good friar john therefore every man desireth to have him in hi company he be no bigot or hypocrite he be not torn and divide betwixt reality and appearance no wretch of a rugged and peevish disposition but honest jovial resolute and a good fellow he travel he labour he defend the oppressed comfort the afflicted help the needy and keep the close of the abbey nay say the monk i do a great deal more than that for whilst we be in despatch our matins and anniversary in the choir i make withal some crossbowstrings polish glass bottle and bolt i twist line and weave purse net wherein to catch coney i be never idle but now hither come some drink some drink here bring the fruit these chestnut be of the wood of estrox and with good new wine be able to make you a fine cracker and composer of bumsonnets you be not a yet it seem well moisten in this house with the sweet wine and must by g i drink to all men freely and at all ford like a proctor or promoter horse friar john say gymnast take away the snot that hang at your nose ha ha say the monk be not i in danger of drown see i be in water even to the nose no no quare quia though some water come out from thence there never go in any for it be well antidoted with potproof armour and syrup of the vineleaf oh my friend he that hath winterboots make of such leather may boldly fish for oyster for they will never take water what be the cause say gargantua that friar john hath such a fair nose because say grangousier that god would have it so who frameth u in such form and for such end a be most agreeable with hi divine will even a a potter fashioneth hi vessel because say ponocrates he come with the first to the fair of nose and therefore make choice of the fair and the great pish say the monk that be not the reason of it but accord to the true monastical philosophy it be because my nurse have soft teat by virtue whereof whilst she give me suck my nose do sink in as in so much butter the hard breast of nurse make child shortnosed but hey gay ad formam nasi cognoscitur ad te levavi i never eat any confection page whilst i be at the bibbery item bring me rather some toast how the monk make gargantua sleep and of hi hour and breviary supper be end they consult of the business in hand and conclude that about midnight they should fall unawares upon the enemy to know what manner of watch and ward they keep and that in the meanwhile they should take a little rest the good to refresh themselves but gargantua could not sleep by any mean on which side soever he turn himself whereupon the monk say to him i never sleep soundly but when i be at sermon or prayer let u therefore begin you and i the seven penitential psalm to try whether you shall not quickly fall asleep the conceit pleased gargantua very well and begin the first of these psalm as soon a they come to the word beati quorum they fell asleep both the one and the other but the monk for hi be formerly accustom to the hour of claustral matins fail not to awake a little before midnight and be up himself awaked all the rest in sing aloud and with a full clear voice the song awake o reinian ho awake awake o reinian ho get up you no more sleep must take get up for we must go when they be all rouse and up he say my master it be a usual saying that we begin matins with coughing and supper with drinking let u now in do clean contrarily begin our matins with drinking and at night before supper we shall cough as hard a we can what say gargantua to drink so soon after sleep this be not to live accord to the diet and prescript rule of the physician for you ought first to scour and cleanse your stomach of all it superfluity and excrement oh well physicked say the monk a hundred devil leap into my body if there be not more old drunkard than old physician i have make this paction and covenant with my appetite that it always lieth down and go to bed with myself for to that i every day give very good order then the next morning it also riseth with me and get up when i be awake mind you your charge gentlemen or tend your cure as much a you will i will get me to my drawer in term of falconry my tire what drawer or tire do you mean say gargantua my breviary say the monk for just a the falconer before they fee their hawk do make them draw at a hen leg to purge their brain of phlegm and sharpen them to a good appetite so by take this merry little breviary in the morning i scour all my lung and be presently ready to drink after what manner say gargantua do you say these fair hour and prayer of yours after the manner of whipfield fessecamp and corruptly fecan say the monk by three psalm and three lesson or nothing at all he that will i never tie myself to hour prayer and sacrament for they be make for the man and not the man for them therefore be it that i make my prayer in fashion of stirrupleathers i shorten or lengthen them when i think good brevis oratio penetrat caelos et longa potatio evacuat scyphos where be that write by my faith say ponocrates i can not tell my pillicock but thou art more worth than gold therein say the monk i be like you but venite apotemus then make they ready store of carbonado or rasher on the coal and good fat soup or brewis with sippets and the monk drink what he please some keep him company and the rest do forbear for their stomach be not a yet open afterwards every man begin to arm and befit himself for the field and they arm the monk against hi will for he desire no other armour for back and breast but hi frock nor any other weapon in hi hand but the staff of the cross yet at their pleasure be he completely arm capapie and mount upon one of the best horse in the kingdom with a good slashing shable by hi side together with gargantua ponocrates gymnast eudemon and fiveandtwenty more of the most resolute and adventurous of grangousiers house all arm at proof with their lance in their hand mount like st george and everyone of them have an arquebusier behind him how the monk encourage hi fellowchampions and how he hang upon a tree valiant champion on their adventure thus go out those valiant champion on their adventure in full resolution to know what enterprise they should undertake and what to take heed of and look well to in the day of the great and horrible battle and the monk encourage them say my child do not fear nor doubt i will conduct you safely god and sanct benedict be with u if i have strength answerable to my courage by death i would plume them for you like duck i fear nothing but the great ordnance yet i know of a charm by way of prayer which the subsexton of our abbey teach me that will preserve a man from the violence of gun and all manner of fireweapons and engine but it will do me no good because i do not believe it nevertheless i hope my staff of the cross shall this day play devilish prank amongst them by g whoever of our party shall offer to play the duck and shrink when blow be adealing i give myself to the devil if i do not make a monk of him in my stead and hamper him within my frock which be a sovereign cure against cowardice did you never hear of my lord meurles hi greyhound which be not worth a straw in the field he put a frock about hi neck by the body of g there be neither hare nor fox that could escape him and which be more he line all the bitch in the country though before that he be feeblereined and ex frigidis et maleficiatis the monk utter these word in choler a he pass under a walnuttree in hi way towards the causey he broach the vizor of hi helmet on the stump of a great branch of the say tree nevertheless he set hi spur so fiercely to the horse who be full of mettle and quick on the spur that he bound forward and the monk go about to ungrapple hi vizor let go hi hold of the bridle and so hang by hi hand upon the bough whilst hi horse steal away from under him by this mean be the monk leave hang on the walnuttree and cry for help murder murder swearing also that he be betray eudemon perceive him first and call gargantua say sir come and see absalom hang gargantua be come consider the countenance of the monk and in what posture he hang wherefore he say to eudemon you be mistake in compare him to absalom for absalom hung by hi hair but this shaveling monk hangeth by the ear help me say the monk in the devil name be this a time for you to prate you seem to me to be like the decretalist preacher who say that whosoever shall see hi neighbour in the danger of death ought upon pain of trisulk excommunication rather choose to admonish him to make hi confession to a priest and put hi conscience in the state of peace than otherwise to help and relieve him and therefore when i shall see them fall into a river and ready to be drown i shall make them a fair long sermon de contemptu mundi et fuga seculi and when they be stark dead shall then go to their aid and succour in fishing after them be quiet say gymnast and stir not my minion i be now come to unhang thee and to set thee at freedom for thou art a pretty little gentle monachus monachus in claustro non valet ovum duo sed quando est extra bene valet triginta i have see above five hundred hang but i never saw any have a good countenance in hi dangling and pendilatory swag truly if i have so good a one i would willingly hang thus all my lifetime what say the monk have you almost do preaching help me in the name of god see you will not in the name of the other spirit or by the habit which i wear you shall repent it tempore et loco praelibatis then gymnast alight from hi horse and climb up the walnuttree lift up the monk with one hand by the gusset of hi armour under the armpit and with the other undid hi vizor from the stump of the broken branch which do he let him fall to the ground and himself after as soon a the monk be down he put off all hi armour and throw away one piece after another about the field and take to him again hi staff of the cross remount up to hi horse which eudemon have catch in hi run away then go they on merrily rid along on the highway how the scout and foreparty of picrochole be meet with by gargantua and how the monk slew captain drawforth tirevant and then be take prisoner by hi enemy i hear the enemy let u rally picrochole at the relation of those who have escape out of the broil and defeat wherein tripet be untriped grow very angry that the devil should have so run upon hi men and hold all that night a counsel of war at which rashcalf and touchfaucet hastiveau touquedillon conclude hi powerto be such that he be able to defeat all the devil of hell if they should come to jostle with hi force this picrochole do not fully believe though he doubt not much of it therefore send he under the command and conduct of the count drawforth for discovering of the country the number of sixteen hundred horseman all well mount upon light horse for skirmish and thoroughly besprinkle with holy water and everyone for their fieldmark or cognizance have the sign of a star in hi scarf to serve at all adventure in case they should happen to encounter with devil that by the virtue a well of that gregorian water a of the star which they wear they might make them disappear and evanish in this equipage they make an excursion upon the country till they come near to the vauguyon which be the valley of guyon and to the spital but could never find anybody to speak unto whereupon they return a little back and take occasion to pass above the aforesaid hospital to try what intelligence they could come by in those part in which resolution rid on and by chance in a pastoral lodge or shepherd cottage near to coudray hit upon the five pilgrim they carry them waybound and manacle a if they have be spy for all the exclamation adjuration and request that they could make being come down from thence towards seville they be hear by gargantua who say then unto those that be with him comrade and fellowsoldiers we have here meet with an encounter and they be ten time in number more than we shall we charge them or no what a devil say the monk shall we do els do you esteem men by their number rather than by their valour and prowess with this he cry out charge devil charge which when the enemy hear they think certainly that they have be very devils and therefore even then begin all of them to run away as hard a they could drive drawforth only except who immediately settle hi lance on it rest and therewith hit the monk with all hi force on the very middle of hi breast but come against hi horrific frock the point of the iron be with the blow either break off or blunt it be in matter of execution a if you have strike against an anvil with a little waxcandle then do the monk with hi staff of the cross give him such a sturdy thump and whirret betwixt hi neck and shoulder upon the acromion bone that he make him lose both sense and motion and fall down stone dead at hi horse foot and see the sign of the star which he wear scarfwise he say unto gargantua these men be but priest which be but the beginning of a monk by st john i be a perfect monk i will kill them to you like fly then run he after them at a swift and full gallop till he overtake the rear and fell them down like treeleaves strike athwart and alongst and every way gymnast presently ask gargantua if they should pursue them to whom gargantua answer by no mean for accord to right military discipline you must never drive your enemy unto despair for that such a strait doth multiply hi force and increase hi courage which be before broken and cast down neither be there any good help or outrage of relief for men that be amaze out of heart toil and spend than to hope for no favour at all how many victory have be take out of the hand of the victor by the vanquish when they would not rest satisfy with reason but attempt to put all to the sword and totally to destroy their enemy without leave so much a one to carry home news of the defeat of hi fellow open therefore unto your enemy all the gate and way and make to them a bridge of silver rather than fail that you may be rid of them yea but say gymnast they have the monk have they the monk say gargantua upon mine honour then it will prove to their cost but to prevent all danger let u not yet retreat but halt here quietly a in an ambush for i think i do already understand the policy and judgment of our enemy they be truly more directed by chance and mere fortune than by good advice and counsel in the meanwhile whilst these make a stop under the walnuttrees the monk pursue on the chase charge all he overtook and give quarter to none until he meet with a trooper who carry behind him one of the poor pilgrim and there would have rifle him the pilgrim in hope of relief at the sight of the monk cry out ha my lord prior my good friend my lord prior save me i beseech you save me which word be hear by those that ride in the van they instantly face about and see there be nobody but the monk that make this great havoc and slaughter among them they load him with blow as thick a they use to do an as with wood but of all this he felt nothing especially when they strike upon hi frock hi skin be so hard then they commit him to two of the marshal men to keep and look about saw nobody come against them whereupon they think that gargantua and hi party be flee then be it that they ride as hard a they could towards the walnuttrees to meet with them and leave the monk there all alone with hi two foresaid men to guard him gargantua hear the noise and neighing of the horse and say to hi men comrade i hear the track and beating of the enemys horsefeet and withal perceive that some of them come in a troop and full body against u let u rally and close here then set forward in order and by this mean we shall be able to receive their charge to their loss and our honour how the monk rid himself of hi keeper and how picrocholes forlorn hope be defeat the monk see them break off thus without order conjecture that they be to set upon gargantua and those that be with him and be wonderfully grieve that he could not succour them then consider he the countenance of the two keeper in whose custody he be who would have willingly run after the troop to get some booty and plunder and be always look towards the valley unto which they be go farther he syllogize say these men be but badly skilled in matter of war for they have not require my parole neither have they take my sword from me suddenly hereafter he draw hi brackmard or horseman sword wherewith he give the keeper which hold him on the right side such a sound slash that he cut clean through the jugulary vein and the sphagitid or transparent artery of the neck with the forepart of the throat call the gargareon even unto the two aden which be throat kernel and redouble the blow he open the spinal marrow betwixt the second and third vertebra there fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground then the monk rein hi horse to the left run upon the other who see hi fellow dead and the monk to have the advantage of him cry with a loud voice ha my lord prior quarter i yield my lord prior quarter quarter my good friend my lord prior and the monk cry likewise my lord posterior my friend my lord posterior you shall have it upon your posteriorums ha say the keeper my lord prior my minion my gentle lord prior i pray god make you an abbot by the habit say the monk which i wear i will here make you a cardinal what do you use to pay ransom to religious men you shall therefore have byandby a red hat of my give and the fellow cry ha my lord prior my lord prior my lord abbot that shall be my lord cardinal my lord all ha ha hes no my lord prior my good little lord the prior i yield render and deliver myself up to you and i deliver thee say the monk to all the devil in hell then at one stroke he cut off hi head cut hi scalp upon the templebones and lift up in the upper part of the skull the two triangulary bone call sincipital or the two bone bregmatis together with the sagittal commissure or dartlike seam which distinguisheth the right side of the head from the left a also a great part of the coronal or forehead bone by which terrible blow likewise he cut the two meninges or film which enwrap the brain and make a deep wound in the brain two posterior ventricle and the cranium or skull abode hang upon hi shoulder by the skin of the pericranium behind in form of a doctor bonnet black without and red within thus fell he down also to the ground stark dead and presently the monk give hi horse the spur and keep the way that the enemy hold who have meet with gargantua and hi companion in the broad highway and be so diminish of their number for the enormous slaughter that gargantua have make with hi great tree amongst them a also gymnast ponocrates eudemon and the rest that they begin to retreat disorderly and in great haste a men altogether affright and trouble in both sense and understanding and a if they have see the very proper specie and form of death before their eye or rather a when you see an as with a brizze or gadbee under hi tail or fly that sting him run hither and thither without keep any path or way throw down hi load to the ground break hi bridle and rein and take no breath nor rest and no man can tell what ail him for they see not anything touch him so flee these people destitute of wit without know any cause of fly only pursue by a panic terror which in their mind they have conceive the monk perceive that their whole intent be to betake themselves to their heel alight from hi horse and get upon a big large rock which be in the way and with hi great brackmard sword lay such load upon those runaway and with main strength fetch a compass with hi arm without feign or spar slew and overthrow so many that hi sword break in two piece then think he within himself that he have slay and kill sufficiently and that the rest should escape to carry news therefore he take up a battleaxe of those that lay there dead and get upon the rock again pass hi time to see the enemy thus fly and to tumble himself amongst the dead body only that he suffer none to carry pike sword lance nor gun with him and those who carry the pilgrim bound he make to alight and give their horse unto the say pilgrim keep them there with him under the hedge and also touchfaucet who be then hi prisoner how the monk carry along with him the pilgrim and of the good word that grangousier give them this skirmish be end gargantua retreat with hi men except the monk and about the dawning of the day they come unto grangousier who in hi bed be pray unto god for their safety and victory and see them all safe and sound he embrace them lovingly and ask what be become of the monk gargantua answer him that without doubt the enemy have the monk then have they mischief and ill luck say grangousier which be very true therefore be it a common proverb to this day to give a man the monk or a in french lui bailler le moine when they would express the do unto one a mischief then command he a good breakfast to be provide for their refreshment when all be ready they call gargantua but he be so aggrieved that the monk be not to be hear of that he would neither eat nor drink in the meanwhile the monk come and from the gate of the out court cry out aloud fresh wine fresh wine gymnast my friend gymnast go out and saw that it be friar john who bring along with him five pilgrim and touchfaucet prisoner whereupon gargantua likewise go forth to meet him and all of them make him the best welcome that possibly they could and bring him before grangousier who ask him of all hi adventure the monk tell him all both how he be take how he rid himself of hi keeper of the slaughter he have make by the way and how he have rescue the pilgrim and bring along with him captain touchfaucet then do they altogether fall to banquet most merrily in the meantime grangousier ask the pilgrim what countrymen they be whence they come and whither they go sweertogo in the name of the rest answer my sovereign lord i be of saint genou in berry this man be of palvau this other be of onzay this of argy this of st nazarand and this man of villebrenin we come from saint sebastian near nantes and be now return a we best may by easy journey yea but say grangousier what go you to do at saint sebastian we go say sweertogo to offer up unto that sanct our vow against the plague ah poor men say grangousier do you think that the plague come from saint sebastian yes truly answer sweertogo our preacher tell u so indeed but be it so say grangousier do the false prophet teach you such abuse do they thus blaspheme the sancts and holy men of god a to make them like unto the devil who do nothing but hurt unto mankindas homer writeth that the plague be send into the camp of the greek by apollo and a the poet feign a great rabble of vejoves and mischievous god so do a certain cafard or dissemble religionary preach at sinay that saint anthony send the fire into men legs that saint eutropius make men hydropic saint clidas fool and that saint genou make them goutish but i punish him so exemplarily though he call me heretic for it that since that time no such hypocritical rogue durst set hi foot within my territory and truly i wonder that your king should suffer them in their sermon to publish such scandalous doctrine in hi dominion for they deserve to be chastise with great severity than those who by magical art or any other device have bring the pestilence into a country the pest killeth but the body but such abominable imposter empoison our very souls a he spake these word in come the monk very resolute and ask them whence be you you poor wretch of saint genou say they and how say the monk do the abbot gulligut the good drinkerand the monk what cheer make they by g body theyll have a fling at your wife and breast them to some purpose whilst you be upon your roam rant and gad pilgrimage hin hen say sweertogo i be not afraid of mine for he that shall see her by day will never break hi neck to come to her in the nighttime yea marry say the monk now you have hit it let her be as ugly a ever be proserpina she will once by the lord g be overturn and get her skincoat shaken if there dwell any monk near to her for a good carpenter will make use of any kind of timber let me be pepper with the pox if you find not all your wife with child at your return for the very shadow of the steeple of an abbey be fruitful it be say gargantua like the water of nilus in egypt if you believe strabo and pliny lib cap what virtue will there be then say the monk in their bullet of concupiscence their habit and their body then say grangousier go your way poor men in the name of god the creator to whom i pray to guide you perpetually and henceforward be not so ready to undertake these idle and unprofitable journey look to your family labour every man in hi vocation instruct your child and live a the good apostle st paul directeth you in do whereof god hi angel and sancts will guard and protect you and no evil or plague at any time shall befall you then gargantua lead them into the hall to take their refection but the pilgrim do nothing but sigh and say to gargantua o how happy be that land which hath such a man for their lord we have be more edified and instruct by the talk which he have with u than by all the sermon that ever be preach in our town this be say gargantua that which plato saith lib de republ that those commonwealth be happy whose ruler philosophate and whose philosopher rule then cause he their wallet to be fill with victual and their bottle with wine and give unto each of them a horse to ease them upon the way together with some penny to live by how grangousier do very kindly entertain touchfaucet hi prisoner touchfaucet be present unto grangousier and by him examine upon the enterprise and attempt of picrochole what it be he could pretend to or aim at by the rustling stir and tumultuary coil of this hi sudden invasion whereunto he answer that hi end and purpose be to conquer all the country if he could for the injury do to hi cakebakers it be too great an undertaking say grangousier and a the proverb be he that grip too much hold fast but little the time be not now a formerly to conquer the kingdom of our neighbour prince and to build up our own greatness upon the loss of our near christian brother this imitation of the ancient herculeses alexander hannibal scipio caesar and other such hero be quite contrary to the profession of the gospel of christ by which we be command to preserve keep rule and govern every man hi own country and land and not in a hostile manner to invade other and that which heretofore the barbars and saracen call prowess and valour we do now call rob thievery and wickedness it would have be more commendable in him to have contain himself within the bound of hi own territory royally govern them than to insult and domineer in mine pillaging and plunder everywhere like a most unmerciful enemy for by rule hi own with discretion he might have increase hi greatness but by rob me he can not escape destruction go your way in the name of god prosecute good enterprise show your king what be amiss and never counsel him with regard unto your own particular profit for the public loss will swallow up the private benefit a for your ransom i do freely remit it to you and will that your arm and horse be restore to you so should good neighbour do and ancient friend see this our difference be not properly war a plato lib de repub would not have it call war but sedition when the greek take up arm against one another and that therefore when such combustion should arise amongst them hi advice be to behave themselves in the managing of them with all discretion and modesty although you call it war it be but superficial it entereth not into the closet and inmost cabinet of our heart for neither of u hath be wrong in hi honour nor be there any question betwixt u in the main but only how to redress by the bye some petty fault commit by our meni mean both yours and ours which although you know you ought to let pas for these quarrelsome person deserve rather to be contemn than mention especially see i offer them satisfaction accord to the wrong god shall be the just judge of our variance whom i beseech by death rather to take me out of this life and to permit my good to perish and be destroy before mine eye than that by me or mine he should in any sort be wrong these word utter he call the monk and before them all thus speak unto him friar john my good friend it be you that take prisoner the captain touchfaucet here present sir say the monk see himself be here and that he be of the year of discretion i have rather you should know it by hi confession than by any word of mine then say touchfaucet my sovereign lord it be he indeed that take me and i do therefore most freely yield myself hi prisoner have you put him to any ransom say grangousier to the monk no say the monk of that i take no care how much would you have for have take him nothing nothing say the monk i be not sway by that nor do i regard it then grangousier command that in presence of touchfaucet should be deliver to the monk for take him the sum of three score and two thousand saluts in english money fifteen thousand and five hundred pound which be do whilst they make a collation or little banquet to the say touchfaucet of whom grangousier ask if he would stay with him or if he love rather to return to hi king touchfaucet answer that he be content to take whatever course he would advise him to then say grangousier return unto your king and god be with you then he give him an excellent sword of a vienne blade with a golden scabbard wrought with vinebranchlike flourish of fair goldsmith work and a collar or neckchain of gold weigh seven hundred and two thousand mark at eight ounce each garnish with precious stone of the fine sort esteem at a hundred and sixty thousand ducat and ten thousand crown more a an honourable don by way of present after this talk touchfaucet get to hi horse and gargantua for hi safety allow him the guard of thirty menatarms and six score archer to attend him under the conduct of gymnast to bring him even unto the gate of the rock clermond if there be need as soon a he be go the monk restore unto grangousier the three score and two thousand saluts which he have receive say sir it be not a yet the time for you to give such gift stay till this war be at an end for none can tell what accident may occur and war begin without good provision of money beforehand for go through with it be but a a breathing of strength and blast that will quickly pass away coin be the sinew of war well then say grangousier at the end i will content you by some honest recompense a also all those who shall do me good service how grangousier send for hi legion and how touchfaucet slew rashcalf and be afterwards execute by the command of picrochole about this same time those of bess of the old market of st james bourg of the draggage of parille of the river of the rock st pol of the vaubreton of pautille of the brehemont of clainbridge of cravant of grammont of the town at the badgerholes of huymes of segre of huss of st lovant of panzoust of the coldraux of verron of coulaines of chose of varenes of bourgueil of the bouchard island of the croullay of narsay of cande of montsoreau and other bordering place send ambassador unto grangousier to tell him that they be advise of the great wrong which picrochole have do him and in regard of their ancient confederacy offer him what assistance they could afford both in men money victual and ammunition and other necessary for war the money which by the joint agreement of them all be send unto him amount to six score and fourteen million two crown and a half of pure gold the force wherewith they do assist him do consist in fifteen thousand cuirassier twoandthirty thousand light horseman four score and nine thousand dragoon and a hundredandforty thousand volunteer adventurer these have with them eleven thousand and two hundred cannon double cannon long piece of artillery call basilisk and small sized one know by the name of spirols besides the mortarpieces and grenadoes of pioneer they have sevenandforty thousand all victual and pay for six month and four day of advance which offer gargantua do not altogether refuse nor wholly accept of but give them hearty thanks say that he would compose and order the war by such a device that there should not be find great need to put so many honest men to trouble in the managing of it and therefore be content at that time to give order only for bring along the legion which he maintain in hi ordinary garrison town of the deviniere of chavigny of gravot and of the quinquenais amounting to the number of two thousand cuirassier three score and six thousand footsoldiers sixandtwenty thousand dragoon attend by two hundred piece of great ordnance twoandtwenty thousand pioneer and six thousand light horseman all draw up in troop so well befit and accommodate with their commissary sutler farrier harnessmakers and other such like necessary member in a military camp so fully instruct in the art of warfare so perfectly know and follow their colour so ready to hear and obey their captain so nimble to run so strong at their charging so prudent in their adventure and every day so well discipline that they seem rather to be a concert of organpipes or mutual concord of the wheel of a clock than an infantry and cavalry or army of soldier touchfaucet immediately after hi return present himself before picrochole and relate unto him at large all that he have do and see and at last endeavoured to persuade him with strong and forcible argument to capitulate and make an agreement with grangousier whom he find to be the honest man in the world say far that it be neither right nor reason thus to trouble hi neighbour of whom they have never receive anything but good and in regard of the main point that they should never be able to go through stitch with that war but to their great damage and mischief for the force of picrochole be not so considerable but that grangousier could easily overthrow them he have not well do speaking when rashcalf say out aloud unhappy be that prince which be by such men serve who be so easily corrupt a i know touchfaucet be for i see hi courage so change that he have willingly join with our enemy to fight against u and betray u if they would have receive him but a virtue be of all both friend and foe praise and esteem so be wickedness soon know and suspect and although it happen the enemy to make use thereof for their profit yet have they always the wicked and the traitor in abomination touchfaucet be at these word very impatient draw out hi sword and therewith run rashcalf through the body a little under the nipple of hi left side whereof he die presently and pull back hi sword out of hi body say boldly so let him perish that shall a faithful servant blame picrochole incontinently grow furious and see touchfaucets new sword and hi scabbard so richly diaper with flourish of most excellent workmanship say did they give thee this weapon so feloniously therewith to kill before my face my so good friend rashcalf then immediately command he hi guard to hew him in piece which be instantly do and that so cruelly that the chamber be all dye with blood afterwards he appoint the corpse of rashcalf to be honourably bury and that of touchfaucet to be cast over the wall into the ditch the news of these excessive violence be quickly spread through all the army whereupon many begin to murmur against picrochole in so far that pinchpenny say to him my sovereign lord i know not what the issue of this enterprise will be i see your men much deject and not well resolve in their mind by consider that we be here very ill provide of victual and that our number be already much diminish by three or four sally furthermore great supply and recruit come daily in to your enemy but we so moulder away that if we be once besiege i do not see how we can escape a total destruction tush pish say picrochole you be like the melun eel you cry before they come to you let them come let them come if they dare how gargantua set upon picrochole within the rock clermond and utterly defeat the army of the say picrochole gargantua have the charge of the whole army and hi father grangousier stay in hi castle who encourage them with good word promise great reward unto those that should do any notable service have thus set forward as soon a they have gain the pas at the ford of vede with boat and bridge speedily make they pass over in a trice then consider the situation of the town which be on a high and advantageous place gargantua think fit to call hi council and pas that night in deliberation upon what be to be do but gymnast say unto him my sovereign lord such be the nature and complexion of the french that they be worth nothing but at the first push then be they more fierce than devil but if they linger a little and be weary with delay theyll prove more faint and remiss than woman my opinion be therefore that now presently after your men have take breath and some small refection you give order for a resolute assault and that we storm them instantly hi advice be find very good and for effectuate thereof he bring forth hi army into the plain field and place the reserve on the skirt or rising of a little hill the monk take along with him six company of foot and two hundred horseman well arm and with great diligence cross the marsh and valiantly get upon the top of the green hillock even unto the highway which lead to loudun whilst the assault be thus begin picrocholes men could not tell well what be best to issue out and receive the assailant or keep within the town and not to stir himself in the mean time without deliberation sallied forth in a rage with the cavalry of hi guard who be forthwith receive and royally entertain with great cannonshot that fell upon them like hail from the high ground on which the artillery be plant whereupon the gargantuists betook themselves unto the valley to give the ordnance leave to play and range with the large scope those of the town defend themselves as well a they could but their shot pass over u without do u any hurt at all some of picrocholes men that have escape our artillery set most fiercely upon our soldier but prevail little for they be all let in betwixt the file and there knock down to the ground which their fellowsoldiers see they would have retreat but the monk have seize upon the pas by the which they be to return they run away and flee in all the disorder and confusion that could be imagine some would have pursue after them and follow the chase but the monk withhold them apprehend that in their pursuit the pursuer might lose their rank and so give occasion to the besiege to sally out of the town upon them then stay there some space and none come against him he send the duke phrontist to advise gargantua to advance towards the hill upon the left hand to hinder picrocholes retreat at that gate which gargantua do with all expedition and send thither four brigade under the conduct of sebast which have no sooner reach the top of the hill but they meet picrochole in the teeth and those that be with him scatter then charge they upon them stoutly yet be they much endamaged by those that be upon the wall who gall them with all manner of shot both from the great ordnance small gun and bow which gargantua perceiving he go with a strong party to their relief and with hi artillery begin to thunder so terribly upon that canton of the wall and so long that all the strength within the town to maintain and fill up the breach be draw thither the monk see that quarter which he keep besiege void of men and competent guard and in a manner altogether naked and abandon do most magnanimously on a sudden lead up hi men towards the fort and never leave it till he have get up upon it know that such a come to the reserve in a conflict bring with them always more fear and terror than those that deal about them with they hand in the fight nevertheless he give no alarm till all hi soldier have get within the wall except the two hundred horseman whom he leave without to secure hi entry then do he give a most horrible shout so do all these who be with him and immediately thereafter without resistance put to the edge of the sword the guard that be at that gate they open it to the horseman with whom most furiously they altogether ran towards the east gate where all the hurlyburly be and come close upon them in the rear overthrew all their force the besiege seeing that the gargantuists have win the town upon them and that they be like to be secure in no corner of it submit themselves unto the mercy of the monk and ask for quarter which the monk very nobly grant to them yet make them lay down their arm then shut them up within church give order to seize upon all the stave of the cross and place men at the door to keep them from come forth then open that east gate he issue out to succour and assist gargantua but picrochole think it have be some relief come to him from the town adventure more forwardly than before and be upon the give of a most desperate homecharge when gargantua cry out ha friar john my friend friar john you be come in a good hour which unexpected accident so affrighted picrochole and hi men that give all for lose they betook themselves to their heel and flee on all hand gargantua chase them till they come near to vaugaudry killing and slay all the way and then sound the retreat how picrochole in hi flight fell into great misfortune and what gargantua do after the battle picrochole thus in despair flee towards the bouchard island and in the way to riviere hi horse stumble and fell down whereat he on a sudden be so incensed that he with hi sword without more ado kill him in hi choler then not find any that would remount him he be about to have take an as at the mill that be thereby but the miller men do so baste hi bone and so soundly bethwack him that they make him both black and blue with stroke then strip him of all hi clothes give him a scurvy old canvas jacket wherewith to cover hi nakedness thus go along this poor choleric wretch who pass the water at porthuaulx and relate hi misadventurous disaster be foretell by an old lourpidon hag that hi kingdom should be restore to him at the come of the cocklicranes which she call coquecigrues what be become of him since we can not certainly tell yet be i tell that he be now a porter at lyon a testy and pettish in humour a ever he be before and would be always with great lamentation inquire at all stranger of the come of the cocklicranes expect assuredly accord to the old woman prophecy that at their come he shall be reestablish in hi kingdom the first thing gargantua do after hi return into the town be to call the musterroll of hi men which when he have do he find that there be very few either kill or wound only some few foot of captain tolmeres company and ponocrates who be shoot with a musketball through the doublet then he cause them all at and in their several post and division to take a little refreshment which be very plenteously provide for them in the best drink and victual that could be have for money and give order to the treasurer and commissary of the army to pay for and defray that repast and that there should be no outrage at all nor abuse commit in the town see it be hi own and furthermore command that immediately after the soldier have do with eating and drinking for that time sufficiently and to their own heart desire a gathering should be beat for bring them altogether to be draw up on the piazza before the castle there to receive six month pay completely all which be do after this by hi direction be bring before him in the say place all those that remain of picrocholes party unto whom in the presence of the prince noble and officer of hi court and army he speak a followeth gargantua speech to the vanquish our forefather and ancestor of all time have be of this nature and disposition that upon the winning of a battle they have choose rather for a sign and memorial of their triumph and victory to erect trophy and monument in the heart of the vanquish by clemency than by architecture in the land which they have conquer for they do hold in great estimation the lively remembrance of men purchase by liberality than the dumb inscription of arch pillar and pyramid subject to the injury of storm and tempest and to the envy of everyone you may very well remember of the courtesy which by them be use towards the breton in the battle of st aubin of cormier and at the demolishing of partenay you have hear and hear admire their gentle comportment towards those at the barrier the barbarian of spaniola who have plunder waste and ransack the maritime border of olone and thalmondois all this hemisphere of the world be fill with the praise and congratulation which yourselves and your father make when alpharbal king of canarre not satisfy with hi own fortune do most furiously invade the land of onyx and with cruel piracy molest all the armor island and confine region of britany yet be he in a set naval fight justly take and vanquish by my father whom god preserve and protect but what whereas other king and emperor yea those who entitle themselves catholic would have deal roughly with him keep him a close prisoner and put him to an extreme high ransom he entreat him very courteously lodge him kindly with himself in hi own palace and out of hi incredible mildness and gentle disposition send him back with a safe conduct laden with gift laden with favour lade with all office of friendship what fell out upon it being return into hi country he call a parliament where all the prince and state of hi kingdom be assemble he show them the humanity which he have find in u and therefore wish them to take such course by way of compensation therein a that the whole world might be edify by the example a well of their honest graciousness to u a of our gracious honesty towards them the result hereof be that it be vote and decree by an unanimous consent that they should offer up entirely their land dominion and kingdom to be dispose of by u accord to our pleasure alpharbal in hi own person presently return with nine thousand and thirtyeight great ship of burden bring with him the treasure not only of hi house and royal lineage but almost of all the country besides for he embark himself to set sail with a westnortheast wind everyone in heap do cast into the ship gold silver ring jewel spice drug and aromatical perfume parrot pelican monkey civetcats blackspotted weasel porcupine c he be account no good mother son that do not cast in all the rare and precious thing he have being safely arrive he come to my say father and would have kiss hi foot that action be find too submissively low and therefore be not permit but in exchange he be most cordially embrace he offer hi present they be not receive because they be too excessive he yield himself voluntarily a servant and vassal and be content hi whole posterity should be liable to the same bondage this be not accept of because it seem not equitable he surrender by virtue of the decree of hi great parliamentary council hi whole country and kingdom to him offer the deed and conveyance sign seal and ratify by all those that be concern in it this be altogether refused and the parchment cast into the fire in end this free goodwill and simple meaning of the canarians work such tenderness in my father heart that he could not abstain from shed tear and weep most profusely then by choice word very congruous adapt strove in what he could to diminish the estimation of the good office which he have do them say that any courtesy he have confer upon them be not worth a rush and what favour soever he have show them he be bind to do it but so much the more do alpharbal augment the repute thereof what be the issue whereas for hi ransom in the great extremity of rigour and most tyrannical dealing could not have be exact above twenty time a hundred thousand crown and hi eldest son detain a hostage till that sum have be pay they make themselves perpetual tributary and oblige to give u every year two million of gold at fourandtwenty carat fine the first year we receive the whole sum of two million the second year of their own accord they pay freely to u threeandtwenty hundred thousand crown the third year sixandtwenty hundred thousand the fourth year three million and do so increase it always out of their own goodwill that we shall be constrain to forbid them to bring u any more this be the nature of gratitude and true thankfulness for time which gnaws and diminisheth all thing els augments and increaseth benefit because a noble action of liberality do to a man of reason doth grow continually by hi generous thinking of it and remember it be unwilling therefore any way to degenerate from the hereditary mildness and clemency of my parent i do now forgive you deliver you from all fine and imprisonment fully release you set you at liberty and every way make you a frank and free a ever you be before moreover at your go out of the gate you shall have every one of you three month pay to bring you home into your house and family and shall have a safe convoy of six hundred cuirassier and eight thousand foot under the conduct of alexander esquire of my body that the clubmen of the country may not do you any injury god be with you i be sorry from my heart that picrochole be not here for i would have give him to understand that this war be undertake against my will and without any hope to increase either my good or renown but see he be lose and that no man can tell where nor how he go away it be my will that hi kingdom remain entire to hi son who because he be too young he not be yet full five year old shall be bring up and instruct by the ancient prince and learn men of the kingdom and because a realm thus desolate may easily come to ruin if the covetousness and avarice of those who by their place be oblige to administer justice in it be not curb and restrain i ordain and will have it so that ponocrates be overseer and superintendent above all hi governor with whatever powerand authority be requisite thereto and that he be continually with the child until he find him able and capable to rule and govern by himself now i must tell you that you be to understand how a too feeble and dissolute facility in pardon evildoer giveth them occasion to commit wickedness afterwards more readily upon this pernicious confidence of receive favour i consider that moses the meek man that be in hi time upon the earth do severely punish the mutinous and seditious people of israel i consider likewise that julius caesar who be so gracious an emperor that cicero say of him that hi fortune have nothing more excellent than that he could and hi virtue nothing well than that he would always save and pardon every manhe notwithstanding all this do in certain place most rigorously punish the author of rebellion after the example of these good men it be my will and pleasure that you deliver over unto me before you depart hence first that fine fellow marquet who be the prime cause origin and groundwork of this war by hi vain presumption and overweening secondly hi fellow cakebakers who be neglect in
