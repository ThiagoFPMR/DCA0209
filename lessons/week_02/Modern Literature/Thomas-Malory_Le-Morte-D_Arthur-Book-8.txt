by no mean she never could get hi love therefore she let ordain upon a day a king meliodas ride ahunting for he be a great chaser and there by an enchantment she make him chase an hart by himself

that she be dead and understood none other but the king be destroy then certain of them would have slay the child because they would have be lord of the country of lion but then through the fair speech of the gentlewoman and by the mean that she make the most part of the baron would not assent thereto and then they let carry home the dead queen and much dole be make for her then this meanwhile merlin deliver king meliodas out of prison on the morn after hi queen be dead and so when the king be come home the most part of the baron make great joy but the sorrow that the king make for hi queen that might no tongue tell so then the king let inter her richly and after he let christen hi child a hi wife have command afore her death and then he let call him tristram the sorrowful

child of king meliodas then be she heavy and wroth that her child should not rejoice the country of lion wherefore this queen ordain for to poison young tristram so she let poison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas tristram and her child be together unto that intent that when tristram be thirsty he should drink that drink and so it fell upon a day the queen son a he be in that chamber espy the piece with poison and he weened it have be good drink and because the child be thirsty he take the piece with poison and drank freely and therewithal suddenly the child brast and be dead when the queen of meliodas wist of the death of her son wit ye well that she be heavy but yet the king understood nothing of her treason notwithstanding the queen would not leave this but eft she let ordain more poison and put it in a piece and by fortune king meliodas her husband find the piece with wine where be the poison and he that be much thirsty take the piece for to drink thereout and a he would have drunken thereof the queen espy him and then she run unto him and pull the piece from him suddenly the king marvel why she do so and remember him how her son be suddenly slay with

that he should slay her but if she tell him truth ah mercy my lord say she and i shall tell you all and then she tell him why she would have slay tristram because her child should rejoice hi land well say king meliodas and therefore shall ye have the law and so she be condemn by the assent of the baron to be burnt and then be there make a great fire and right a she be at the fire to take her execution young tristram kneel afore king meliodas and beseech him to give him a boon i will well say the king again then say young tristram give me the life of thy queen my stepmother that be unrightfully ask say king meliodas for thou ought of right to hate her for she would have slay thee with that poison an she might have have her will and for thy sake most be my cause that she should

sir tristram go to the fire and by the commandment of the king deliver her from the death but after that king meliodas would never have ado with her a at bed and board but by the good mean of young tristram he make the king and her accord but then the king would not suffer young tristram to abide no longer in hi court and then he let ordain a gentleman that be well learn and teach hi name be gouvernail and then he send young tristram with gouvernail into france to learn the language and nurture and deed of arm and there be tristram more than seven year and then when he well could speak the language and have learn all that he might learn in that country then he come home to hi father king meliodas again and so tristram learn to be an harper passing all other that there be none such call in no country and so on harping and on instrument of music he apply him in hi youth for to learn and after a he grow in might and strength he labour ever in hunt and in hawk so that never gentleman more that ever we hear read of and a the book saith he begin good measure of blowing of beast of venery and beast of chase and all manner of vermin and all these term we have yet of hawking and hunting and therefore the book of venery of hawking and hunting be call the book of sir tristram wherefore a meseemeth all gentleman that bear old arm ought of right to honour sir tristram for the goodly term that gentleman have and use and shall to the day of doom that thereby in a manner all men of worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman and from a yeoman a villain for he that gentle be will draw him unto gentle tatches and to follow the custom of noble gentleman thus sir tristram endure in cornwall until he be big and strong of the age of eighteen year and then the king meliodas have great joy of sir tristram and so have the queen hi wife for ever after in her life because sir tristram save her from the fire she do never hate him more after but love him ever after and give tristram many great gift for every estate love him where that he go then it befall that king anguish of ireland send unto king mark of cornwall for hi truage that cornwall have pay many winter and all

send daily unto king mark then they of cornwall let make cry in every place that what knight would fight for to save the truage of cornwall he should be reward so that he should fare the good term of hi life then some of the baron say to king mark and counsel him to send to the court of king arthur for to seek sir launcelot du lake that be that time name for the marvelloust knight of all the world then there be some other baron that counsel the king not to do so and say that it be labour in vain because sir marhaus be a knight of the round table therefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other but if it be any knight at hi own request would fight disguise and unknown so the king and all hi baron assent that it be no bote to seek any knight of the round table this mean while come the language and the noise unto king meliodas how that sir marhaus abide battle fast by tintagil and how king mark could find no manner knight to fight for him when young tristram heard of this he be

begin to feutre their spear and they meet so fiercely together that they smite either other down both horse and all but sir marhaus smote sir tristram a great wound in the side with hi spear and then they avoid their horse and pull out their sword and throw their shield afore them and then they lash together a men that be wild and courageous and when they have stricken so together long then they leave their stroke and foined at their breath and visor and when they saw that that might not prevail them then they hurtle together like ram to bear either other down thus they fight still more than half a day and either be wound pass sore that the blood run down freshly from them upon the ground by then sir tristram wax more fresher than sir marhaus and good wind and big and with a mighty stroke he smite sir marhaus upon the helm such a buffet that it go through hi helm and through the coif of steel and through the brainpan and the sword stick so fast in the helm and in hi brainpan that sir

before this day trust you above all earthly knight and a she saith ye have deceive her therefore wit ye well there may no man hold that will away and rather than ye should be heartily displease with me i would ye have her an she would abide with you nay say the lady so god me help i will never go with him for he that i love most i weened he have love me and therefore sir tristram she say ride a thou come for though thou haddest overcome this knight a ye be likely with thee never would i have go and i shall pray this knight so fair of hi knighthood that or ever he pass this country that he will lead me to the abbey where my lord sir segwarides lieth so god me help say bleoberis i let you wit good knight sir tristram because king mark give me the choice of a gift in this court and so this lady like me best notwithstanding she be wed and hath a lord and i have fulfil my quest she shall be send unto her husband again and in especial most for your sake sir tristram and if she would go with you i would ye have her i thank you say sir tristram but for her love i shall beware what manner a lady i shall love or trust for have her lord sir segwarides be away from the court i should have be the first that should have follow you but sithen that ye have refuse me a i be true knight i shall her know passingly well that i shall love or trust and so they take their leave one from the other and departed and so sir tristram rode unto tintagil and sir bleoberis ride unto the abbey where sir segwarides lay sore wounded and there he deliver hi lady and depart a a noble knight and when sir segwarides saw hi lady he be greatly comfort and then she tell him that sir tristram have do great battle with sir bleoberis and cause him to bring her again these word please sir segwarides right well that sir tristram would do so much and so that lady tell all the battle unto king mark betwixt sir tristram and sir bleoberis then when this be do king mark cast always in hi heart how he might destroy sir tristram and then he imagine in himself to send sir tristram into ireland for la beale isoud for sir tristram have so praised her beauty and her goodness that king mark say that he would wed her whereupon he pray sir tristram to take hi way into ireland for him on message and all this be do to the intent to slay sir tristram notwithstanding sir tristram would not refuse the message for no danger nor peril that might fall for the pleasure of hi uncle but to go he make him ready in the most goodly wise that might be devise for sir tristram take with him the most goodly knight that he might find in the court and they be array after the guise that be then use in the goodly manner so sir tristram depart and take the sea with all hi fellowship and anon a he be in the broad sea a tempest take him and hi fellowship and drive them back into the coast of england and there they arrive fast by camelot and full fain they be to take the land and when they be land sir tristram set up hi pavilion upon the land of camelot and there he let hang hi shield upon the pavilion and that same day come two knight of king arthur that one be sir ector de mari and sir morganor and they touch the shield and bid him come out of the pavilion for to joust an he would joust ye shall be answer say sir tristram an ye will tarry a little while so he make him ready and first he smite down sir ector de mari and after he smite down sir morganor all with one spear and sore bruise them and when they lay upon the earth they ask sir tristram what he be and of what country he be knight fair lord say sir tristram wit ye well that i be of cornwall ala say sir ector now be i ashamed that ever any cornish knight should overcome me and then for despite sir ector put off hi armour from him and go on foot and would not ride then it fell that sir bleoberis and sir blamore de ganis that be brother they have summon the king anguish of ireland for to come to arthur court upon pain of forfeiture of king arthur good grace and if the king of ireland come not in at the day assign and set the king should lose hi land so it happen that at the day assign king arthur neither sir launcelot might not be there for to give the judgment for king arthur be with sir launcelot at the castle joyous garde and so king arthur assign king carados and the king of scot to be there that day a judge so when the king be at camelot king anguish of ireland be come to know hi accuser then be there sir blamore de ganis and appeal the king of ireland of treason that he have slay a cousin of hi in hi court in ireland by treason the king be sore abash of hi accusation forwhy he be come at the summons of king arthur and or he come at camelot he wist not wherefore he be send after and when the king heard sir blamore say hi will he understood well there be none other remedy but for to answer him knightly for the custom be such in those day that an any man be appeal of any treason or murder he should fight body for body or els to find another knight for him and all manner of murder in those day be call treason so when king anguish understood hi accuse he be pass heavy for he know sir blamore de ganis that he be a noble knight and of noble knight come then the king of ireland be simply purvey of hi answer therefore the judge give him respite by the third day to give hi answer so the king depart unto hi lodge the meanwhile there come a lady by sir tristram pavilion make great dole what aileth you say sir tristram that ye make such dole ah fair knight say the lady i be ashamed unless that some good knight help me for a great lady of worship send by me a fair child and a rich unto sir launcelot du lake and hereby there meet with me a knight and throw me down from my palfrey and take away the child from me well my lady say sir tristram and for my lord sir launcelots sake i shall get you that child again or els i shall be beat for it and so sir tristram take hi horse and ask the lady which way the knight rode and then she tell him and he ride after him and within a while he overtake that knight and then sir tristram bid him turn and give again the child the knight turn hi horse and make him ready to fight and then sir tristram smite him with a sword such a buffet that he tumble to the earth and then he yield him unto sir tristram then come thy way say sir tristram and bring the child to the lady again so he take hi horse meekly and rode with sir tristram and then by the way sir tristram ask him hi name then he say my name be breuse saunce pite so when he have deliver that child to the lady he say sir a in this the child be well remedied then sir tristram let him go again that sore repent him after for he be a great foe unto many good knight of king arthur court then when sir tristram be in hi pavilion gouvernail hi man come and tell him how that king anguish of ireland be come thither and he be put in great distress and there gouvernail tell sir tristram how king anguish be summon and appeal of murder so god me help say sir tristram these be the best tidings that ever come to me this seven year for now shall the king of ireland have need of my help for i daresay there be no knight in this country that be not of arthur court dare do battle with sir blamore de ganis and for to win the love of the king of ireland i will take the battle upon me and therefore gouvernail bring me i charge thee to the king then gouvernail go unto king anguish of ireland and salute him fair the king welcome him and ask him what he would sir say gouvernail here be a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you he bid me say he would do you service what knight be he say the king sir say he it be sir tristram de lion that for your good grace that ye show him in your land will reward you in this country come on fellow say the king with me anon and show me unto sir tristram so the king take a little hackney and but few fellowship with him until he come unto sir tristram pavilion and when sir tristram saw the king he run unto him and would have holden hi stirrup but the king leapt from hi horse lightly and either hals other in their arm my gracious lord say sir tristram gramercy of your great goodness show unto me in your march and land and at that time i promise you to do you service an ever it lay in my power and gentle knight say the king unto sir tristram now have i great need of you never have i so great need of no knight help how so my good lord say sir tristram i shall tell you say the king i be summon and appeal from my country for the death of a knight that be kin unto the good knight sir launcelot wherefore sir blamore de ganis brother to sir bleoberis hath appeal me to fight with him outher to find a knight in my stead and well i wot say the king these that be come of king ban blood a sir launcelot and these other be pass good knight and hard men for to win in battle a any that i know now live sir say sir tristram for the good lordship ye show me in ireland and for my lady your daughter sake la beale isoud i will take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two thing that one be that ye shall swear to me that ye be in the right that ye be never consent to the knight death sir then say sir tristram when that i have do this battle if god give me grace that i speed that ye shall give me a reward what thing reasonable that i will ask of you so god me help say the king ye shall have whatsomever ye will ask it be well say say sir tristram now make your answer that your champion be ready for i shall die in your quarrel rather than to be recreant i have no doubt of you say the king that an ye should have ado with sir launcelot du lake sir say sir tristram a for sir launcelot he be call the noble knight of the world and wit ye well that the knight of hi blood be noble men and dread shame and a for bleoberis brother unto sir blamore i have do battle with him therefore upon my head it be no shame to call him a good knight it be noise say the king that blamore be the hardy knight sir a for that let him be he shall never be refuse an a he be the best knight that now beareth shield or spear so king anguish depart unto king carados and the king that be that time a judge and tell them that he have find hi champion ready then by the commandment of the king sir blamore de ganis and sir tristram be send for to hear the charge and when they be come before the judge there be many king and knight behold sir tristram and much speech they have of him because that he slew sir marhaus the good knight and because he forjousted sir palamides the good knight so when they have take their charge they withdraw them to make them ready to do battle then say sir bleoberis unto hi brother sir blamore fair dear brother remember of what kin we be come of and what a man be sir launcelot du lake neither far nor near but brother child and there be never none of our kin that ever be sham in battle and rather suffer death brother than to be sham brother say blamore have ye no doubt of me for i shall never shame none of my blood howbeit i be sure that yonder knight be call a passing good knight a of hi time one of the world yet shall i never yield me nor say the loath word well may he happen to smite me down with hi great might of chivalry but rather shall he slay me than i shall yield me a recreant god speed you well say sir bleoberis for ye shall find him the mighty knight that ever ye have ado withal for i know him for i have have ado with him god me speed say sir blamore de ganis and therewith he take hi horse at the one end of the list and sir tristram at the other end of the list and so they feutred their spear and come together a it have be thunder and there sir tristram through great might smite down sir blamore and hi horse to the earth then anon sir blamore avoid hi horse and pull out hi sword and throw hi shield afore him and bid sir tristram alight for though an horse hath fail me i trust to god the earth will not fail me and then sir tristram alight and dress him unto battle and there they lash together strongly a racing and trace foining and dash many sad stroke that the king and knight have great wonder that they might stand for ever they fight like wood men so that there be never knight see fight more fiercely than they do for sir blamore be so hasty that he would have no rest that all men wonder that they have breath to stand on their foot and all the place be bloody that they fight in and at the last sir tristram smote sir blamore such a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon hi side and sir tristram stand and behold him then when sir blamore might speak he say thus sir tristram de lion i require thee a thou art a noble knight and the best knight that ever i find that thou wilt slay me out for i would not live to be make lord of all the earth for i have liefer die with worship than live with shame and need sir tristram thou must slay me or els thou shalt never win the field for i will never say the loath word and therefore if thou dare slay me slay me i require thee when sir tristram hear him say so knightly he wist not what to do with him he remember him of both party of what blood he be come and for sir launcelots sake he would be loath to slay him and in the other party in no wise he might not choose but that he must make him to say the loath word or els to slay him then sir tristram stert aback and go to the king that be judge and there he kneel down tofore them and beseech them for their worship and for king arthur and sir launcelots sake that they would take this matter in their hand for my fair lord say sir tristram it be shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder lieth should be slay for ye hear well sham will he not be and i pray to god that he never be slay nor sham for me and a for the king for whom i fight for i shall require him a i be hi true champion and true knight in this field that he will have mercy upon this good knight so god me help say king anguish i will for your sake sir tristram be rule a ye will have me for i know you for my true knight and therefore i will heartily pray the king that be here a judge to take it in their hand and the king that be judge call sir bleoberis to them and ask him hi advice my lord say bleoberis though my brother be beat and hath the bad through might of arm i dare say though sir tristram hath beat hi body he hath not beat hi heart and i thank god he be not sham this day and rather than he should be sham i require you say bleoberis let sir tristram slay him out it shall not be so say the king for hi part adversary both the king and the champion have pity of sir blamores knighthood my lord say bleoberis i will right well a ye will then the king call the king of ireland and find him goodly and treatable and then by all their advice sir tristram and sir bleoberis take up sir blamore and the two brother be accord with king anguish and kiss and make friend for ever and then sir blamore and sir tristram kiss together and there they make their oath that they would never none of them two brother fight with sir tristram and sir tristram make the same oath and for that gentle battle all the blood of sir launcelot love sir tristram for ever then king anguish and sir tristram take their leave and sail into ireland with great noblesse and joy so when they be in ireland the king let make it know throughout all the land how and in what manner sir tristram have do for him then the queen and all that there be make the most of him that they might but the joy that la beale isoud make of sir tristram there might no tongue tell for of all men earthly she love him most then upon a day king

and charge them that what day king mark should wed that same day they should give him that drink so that king mark should drink to la beale isoud and then say the queen i undertake either shall love other the day of their life so this drink be give unto dame bragwaine and unto gouvernail and then anon sir tristram take the sea and la beale isoud and when they be in their cabin it hap so that they be thirsty and they saw a little flasket of gold stand by them and it seem by the colour and the taste that it be noble wine then sir tristram take the flasket in hi hand and say madam isoud here be the best drink that ever ye drank that dame bragwaine your maiden and gouvernail my servant have keep for themselves then they laugh and make good cheer and either drank to other freely and they think never drink that ever they drink to other be so sweet nor so good but by that their drink be in their body they love either other so well that never their love depart for weal neither for woe and thus it hap the love first betwixt sir tristram and la beale isoud the which love never depart the day of their life so then they sail till by fortune they come nigh a castle that hight pluere and thereby arrive for to repose them weening to them to have have good harbourage but anon a sir tristram be within the castle they be take prisoner for the custom of the castle be such who that rode by that castle and bring any lady he must need fight with the lord that hight breunor and if it be so that breunor win the field then should the knight stranger and hi lady be put to death what that ever they be and if it be so that the strange knight win the field of sir breunor then should he die and hi lady both this custom be use many winter for it be call the castle pluere that be to say the weeping castle thus a sir tristram and la beale isoud be in prison it hap a knight and a lady come unto them where they be to cheer them i have marvel say tristram unto the knight and the lady what be the cause the lord of this castle holdeth u in prison it be never the custom of no place of worship that ever i come in when a knight and a lady ask harbour and they to receive them and after to destroy them that be hi guest sir say the knight this be the old custom of this castle that when a knight cometh here he must need fight with our lord and he that be weak must lose hi head and when that be do if hi lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord wife she must lose her head and if she be fair prove than be our lady then shall the lady of this castle lose her head so god me help say sir tristram this be a foul custom and a shameful but one advantage have i say sir tristram i have a lady be fair enough fairer saw i never in all my lifedays and i doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head and rather than i should lose my head i will fight for it on a fair field wherefore sir knight i pray you tell your lord that i will be ready a tomorn with my lady and myself to do battle if it be so i may have my horse and mine armour sir say that knight i undertake that your desire shall be speed right well and then he say take your rest and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready and your lady for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth and therewith he depart and on the morn betimes that same knight come to sir tristram and fetch him out and hi lady and bring him horse and armour that be hi own and bid him make him ready to the field for all the estate and common of that lordship be there ready to behold that battle and judgment then come sir breunor the lord of that castle with hi lady in hi hand muffle and ask sir tristram where be hi lady for an thy lady be fair than mine with thy sword smite off my ladys head and if my lady be fair than thine with my sword i must strike off her head and if i may win thee yet shall thy lady be mine and thou shalt lose thy head sir say tristram this be a foul custom and horrible and rather than my lady should lose her head yet have i liefer lose my head nay nay say sir breunor the lady shall be first show together and the one shall have her judgment nay i will not so say sir tristram for here be none that will give righteous judgment but i doubt not say sir tristram my lady be fair than thine and that will i prove and make good with my hand and whosomever he be that will say the contrary i will prove it on hi head and therewith sir tristram show la beale isoud and turn her thrice about with hi naked sword in hi hand and when sir breunor saw that he do the same wise turn hi lady but when sir breunor behold la beale isoud him think he saw never a fairer lady and then he dread hi ladys head should be off and so all the people that be there present give judgment that la beale isoud be the fairer lady and the good make how now say sir tristram meseemeth it be pity that my lady should lose her head but because thou and she of long time have use this wicked custom and by you both have many good knight and lady be destroy for that cause it be no loss to destroy you both so god me help say sir breunor for to say the sooth thy lady be fair than mine and that me sore repenteth and so i hear the people privily say for of all woman i saw none so fair and therefore an thou wilt slay my lady i doubt not but i shall slay thee and have thy lady thou shalt win her say sir tristram as dear a ever knight win lady and because of thine own judgment a thou wouldst have do to my lady if that she have be fouler and because of the evil custom give me thy lady say sir tristram and therewithal sir tristram strode unto him and take hi lady from him and with an awk stroke he smite off her head clean well knight say sir breunor now hast thou do me a despite now take thine horse sithen i be ladyless i will win thy lady an i may then they take their horse and come together a it have be the thunder and sir tristram smote sir breunor clean from hi horse and lightly he rise up and a sir tristram come again by him he thrust hi horse throughout both the shoulder that hi horse hurl here and there and fell dead to the ground and ever sir breunor run after to have slay sir tristram but sir tristram be light and nimble and void hi horse lightly and or ever sir tristram might dress hi shield and hi sword the other give him three or four sad stroke then they rush together like two boar trace and traverse mightily and wisely a two noble knight for this sir breunor be a proved knight and have be or then the death of many good knight that it be pity that he have so long endured thus they fight hurl here and there nigh two hour and either be wound sore then at the last sir breunor rash upon sir tristram and take him in hi arm for he trust much in hi strength then be sir tristram call the strong and the high knight of the world for he be call big than sir launcelot but sir launcelot be well breathe so anon sir tristram thrust sir breunor down grovel and then he unlace hi helm and strike off hi head and then all they that long to the castle come to him and do him homage and fealty pray him that he would abide there still a little while to fordo that foul custom sir tristram grant thereto the meanwhile one of the knight of the castle rode unto sir galahad the haut prince the which be sir breunors son which be a noble knight and tell him what misadventure hi father have and hi mother then come sir galahad and the king with the hundred knight with him and this sir galahad proffer to fight with sir tristram hand for hand and so they make them ready to go unto battle on horseback with great courage then sir galahad and sir tristram meet together so hard that either bare other down horse and all to the earth and then they avoid their horse a noble knight and dress their shield and draw their sword with ire and rancour and they lash together many sad stroke and one while strike another while foining trace and traverse a noble knight thus they fight long near half a day and either be sore wound at the last sir tristram wax light and big and double hi stroke and drive sir galahad aback on the one side and on the other so that he be like to have be slay with that come the king with the hundred knight and all that fellowship go fiercely upon sir tristram when sir tristram saw them come upon him then he wist well he might not endure then a a wise knight of war he say to sir galahad the haut prince sir ye show to me no knighthood for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at once and a meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hand it be great shame to you so god me help say sir galahad there be none other way but thou must yield thee to me other els to die say sir galahad to sir tristram i will rather yield me to you than die for that be more for the might of your men than of your hand and therewithal sir tristram take hi own sword by the point and put the pommel in the hand of sir galahad therewithal come the king with the hundred knight and hard begin to assail sir tristram let be say sir galahad be ye not so hardy to touch him for i have give this knight hi life that be your shame say the king with the hundred knight hath he not slay your father and your mother a for that say sir galahad i may not wite him greatly for my father have him in prison and enforce him to do battle with him and my father have such a custom that be a shameful custom that what knight come there to ask harbour hi lady must need die but if she be fair than my mother and if my father overcame that knight he must need die this be a shameful custom and usage a knight for hi harbourasking to have such harbourage and for this custom i would never draw about him so god me help say the king this be a shameful custom truly say sir galahad so seem me and meseemed it have be great pity that this knight should have be slay for i dare say he be the noble man that beareth life but if it be sir launcelot du lake now fair knight say sir galahad i require thee tell me thy name and of whence thou art and whither thou wilt sir he say my name be sir tristram de lion and from king mark of cornwall i be send on message unto king anguish of ireland for to fetch hi daughter to be hi wife and here she be ready to go with me into cornwall and her name be la beale isoud and sir tristram say sir galahad the haut prince well be ye find in these march and so ye will promise me to go unto sir launcelot du lake and accompany with him ye shall go where ye will and your fair lady with you and i shall promise you never in all my day shall such custom be use in this castle a have be use sir say sir tristram now i let you wit so god me help i weened ye have be sir launcelot du lake when i saw you first and therefore i dread you the more and sir i promise you say sir tristram as soon a i may i will see sir launcelot and in fellowship me with him for of all the knight of the world i most desire hi fellowship and then sir tristram take hi leave when he saw hi time and take the sea and in the meanwhile word come unto sir launcelot and to sir tristram that sir carados the mighty king that be make like a giant fought with sir gawain and give him such stroke that he swoon in hi saddle and after that he take him by the collar and pull him out of hi saddle and fast bind him to the saddlebow and so ride hi way with him toward hi castle and a he ride by fortune sir launcelot meet with sir carados and anon he know sir gawain that lay bound after him ah say sir launcelot unto sir gawain how stand it with you never so hard say sir gawain unless that ye help me for so god me help without ye rescue me i know no knight that may but outher you or sir tristram wherefore sir launcelot be heavy of sir gawain word and then sir launcelot bid sir carados lay down that knight and fight with me thou art but a fool say sir carados for i will serve you in the same wise a for that say sir launcelot spare me not for i warn thee i will not spare thee and then he bind sir gawain hand and foot and so throw him to the ground and then he gat hi spear of hi squire and depart from sir launcelot to fetch hi course and so either meet with other and brake their spear to their hand and then they pull out sword and hurtle together on horseback more than an hour and at the last sir launcelot smote sir carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierce hi brainpan so then sir launcelot take sir carados by the collar and pull him under hi horse foot and then he alight and pull off hi helm and strike off hi head and then sir launcelot unbound sir gawain so this same tale be tell to sir galahad and to sir tristram here may ye hear the nobleness that followeth sir launcelot ala say sir tristram an i have not this message in hand with this fair lady truly i would never stint or i have find sir launcelot then sir tristram and la beale isoud go to the sea and come into cornwall and there all the baron meet them and anon they be richly wed with

again to king mark and then be there make great joy of her homecoming who be cherish but sir tristram then sir tristram let fetch sir lambegus hi knight from the forester house and it be long or he be whole but at the last he be well recover thus they live with joy and play a long while but ever sir andred that be nigh cousin to sir tristram lay in a watch to wait betwixt sir tristram and la beale isoud for to take them and slander them so upon a day sir tristram talk with la beale isoud in a window and that espy sir andred and tell it to the king then king mark take a sword in hi hand and come to sir tristram and call him false traitor and would have stricken him but sir tristram be nigh him and run under hi sword and take it out of hi hand and then the king cry where be my knight and my men i charge you slay this traitor but at that time there be not one would move for hi word when sir tristram saw that there be not one would be against him he shake the sword to the king and make countenance a though he would have stricken him and then king mark flee and sir tristram follow him and smite upon him five or six stroke flatling on the neck that he make him to fall upon the nose and then sir tristram yede hi way and arm him and take hi horse and hi man and so he ride into that forest and there upon a day sir tristram meet with two brother that be knight with king mark and there he strike off the head of the one and wound the other to the death and he make him to bear hi brother head in hi helm unto the king and thirty more there he wound and when that knight come before the king to say hi message he there die afore the king and the queen then king mark call hi council unto him and ask advice of hi baron what be best to do with sir tristram sir say the baron in especial sir dinas the seneschal sir we will give you counsel for to send for sir tristram for we will that ye wit many men will hold with sir tristram an he be hard bestead and sir say sir dinas ye shall understand that sir tristram be call peerless and makeless of any christian knight and of hi might and hardiness we know none so good a knight but if it be sir launcelot du lake and if he depart from your court and go to king arthur court wit ye well he will get him such friend there that he will not set by your malice and therefore sir i counsel you to take him to your grace i will well say the king that he be send for that we may be friend then the baron send for sir tristram under a safe conduct and so when sir tristram come to the king he be welcome and no rehearsal be make and there be game and play and then the king and the queen go ahunting and sir tristram the king and the queen make their pavilion and their tent in that forest beside a river and there be daily hunting and jousting for there be ever thirty knight ready to joust unto all them that come in at that time and there by fortune come sir lamorak de galis and sir driant and there sir driant joust right well but at the last he have a fall then sir lamorak proffer to joust and when he begin he fare so with the thirty knight that there be not one of them but that he give him a fall and some of them be sore hurt i marvel say king mark what knight he be that doth such deed of arm sir say sir tristram i know him well for a noble knight a few now be live and hi name be sir lamorak de galis it be great shame say the king that he should go thus away unless that some of you meet with him good sir say sir tristram meseemeth it be no worship for a noble man to have ado with him and for because at this time he hath do over much for any mean knight live therefore a meseemeth it be great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time insomuch a he and hi horse be weary both for the deed of arm that he hath do this day an they be well consider it be enough for sir launcelot du lake a for that say king mark i require you a ye love me and my lady the queen la beale isoud take your arm and joust with sir lamorak de galis sir say sir tristram ye bid me do a thing that be against knighthood and well i can deem that i shall give him a fall for it be no mastery for my horse and i be fresh both and so be not hi horse and he and wit ye well that he will take it for great unkindness for ever one good knight be loath to take another at disadvantage but because i will not displease you a ye require me so will i do and obey your commandment and so sir tristram arm him and take hi horse and put him forth and there sir lamorak meet him mightily and what with the might of hi own spear and of sir tristram spear sir lamoraks horse fell to the earth and he sit in the saddle then anon as lightly a he might he avoid the saddle and hi horse and put hi shield afore him and draw hi sword and then he bid sir tristram alight thou knight an thou durst nay say sir tristram i will no more have ado with thee for i have do to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship a for that say sir lamorak i can thee no thank since thou hast forjousted me on horseback i require thee and i beseech thee an thou be sir tristram fight with me on foot i will not so say sir tristram and wit ye well my name be sir tristram de lion and well i know ye be sir lamorak de galis and this that i have do to you be against my will but i be require thereto but to say that i will do at your request a at this time i will have no more ado with you for me shameth of that i have do a for the shame say sir lamorak on thy part or on mine bear thou it an thou wilt for though a mare son hath fail me now a queen son shall not fail thee and therefore an thou be such a knight a men call thee i require thee alight and fight with me sir lamorak say sir tristram i understand your heart be great and cause why ye have to say thee sooth for it would grieve me an any knight should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary knight for that knight nor horse be never form that alway might stand or endure and therefore say sir tristram i will not have ado with you for me forthinketh of that i have do a for that say sir lamorak i shall quit you an ever i see my time so he depart from him with sir driant and by the way they meet with a knight that be send from morgan le fay unto king arthur and this knight have a fair horn harness with gold and the horn have such a virtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn but if she be true to her husband and if she be false she should spill all the drink and if she be true to her lord she might drink peaceable and because of the queen guenever and in the despite of sir launcelot this horn be send unto king arthur and by force sir lamorak make that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn now shalt thou bear this horn say lamorak unto king mark or els choose thou to die for it for i tell thee plainly in despite and reproof of sir tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto king mark hi uncle and say thou to him that i send it him for to assay hi lady and if she be true to him he shall prove her so the knight go hi way unto king mark and bring him that rich horn and say that sir lamorak send it him and thereto he tell him the virtue of that horn then the king make queen isoud to drink thereof and an hundred lady and there be but four lady of all those that drank clean ala say king mark this be a great despite and sware a great oath that she should be burn and the other lady then the baron gather them together and say plainly they would not have those lady burn for an horn make by sorcery that come from a false a sorceress and witch a then be live for that horn do never good but caused strife and debate and always in her day she have be an enemy to all true lover so there be many knight make their avow an ever they meet with morgan le fay that they would show her short courtesy also sir tristram be pass wroth that sir lamorak send that horn unto king mark for well he know that it be do in the despite of him and therefore he think to quite sir lamorak then sir tristram use daily and nightly to go to queen isoud when he might and ever sir andred hi cousin watch him night and day for to take him with la beale isoud and so upon a night sir andred espy the hour and the time when sir tristram go to hi lady then sir andred gat unto him twelve knight and at midnight he set upon sir tristram secretly and suddenly and there sir tristram be take naked abed with la beale isoud and then be he bind hand and foot and so be he keep until day and then by the assent of king mark and of sir andred and of some of the baron sir tristram be lead unto a chapel that stand upon the sea rock there for to take hi judgment and so he be lead bounden with forty knight and when sir tristram saw that there be none other boot but need that he must die then say he fair lord remember what i have do for the country of cornwall and in what jeopardy i have be in for the weal of you all for when i fight for the truage of cornwall with sir marhaus the good knight i be promise for to be well reward when ye all refuse to take the battle therefore a ye be good gentle knight see me not thus shamefully to die for it be shame to all knighthood thus to see me die for i dare say say sir tristram that i never meet with no knight but i be as good a he or good fie upon thee say sir andred false traitor that thou art with thine avaunting for all thy boast thou shalt die this day o andred andred say sir tristram thou shouldst be my kinsman and now thou art to me full unfriendly but an there be no more but thou and i thou wouldst not put me to death no say sir andred and therewith he draw hi sword and would have slay him when sir tristram saw him make such countenance he look upon both hi hand that be fast bounden unto two knight and suddenly he pull them both to him and unwrast hi hand and then he leap unto hi cousin sir andred and wrest hi sword out of hi hand then he smite sir andred that he fell to the earth and so sir tristram fought till that he have kill ten knight so then sir tristram gat the chapel and keep it mightily then the cry be great and the people draw fast unto sir andred mo than an hundred when sir tristram saw the people draw unto him he remember he be naked and sperd fast the chapel door and brake the bar of a window and so he leap out and fell upon the crag in the sea and so at that time sir andred nor none of hi fellow might get to him at that time so when they be depart gouvernail and sir lambegus and sir sentraille de lushon that be sir tristram men seek their master when they hear he be escape then they be pass glad and on the rock they find him and with towel they pull him up and then sir tristram ask them where be la beale isoud for he weened she have be have away of andreds people sir say gouvernail she be put in a lazarcote ala say sir tristram this be a full ungoodly place for such a fair lady and if i may she shall not be long there and so he take hi
