people with a reverence that approach idolatry he now saw himself stain with the most loathed and monstrous sin the object of universal execration a prisoner of the holy office and probably doom to perish in torture the most severe he could not hope to deceive hi judge the proof of hi guilt be too strong hi be in the sepulchre at so late an hour hi confusion at the discovery the dagger which in hi first alarm he own have be conceal by him and the blood which have spirt upon hi habit from antonias wound sufficiently mark him out for the assassin he wait with agony for the day of examination he have no resource to comfort him in hi distress religion could not inspire him with fortitude if he read the book of morality which be put into hi hand he saw in them nothing but the enormity of hi offence if he attempt to pray he recollect that he deserve not heavens protection and believe hi crime so monstrous a to baffle even god infinite goodness for every other sinner he think there might be hope but for him there could be none shudder at the past anguish by the present and dread the future thus pass he the few day precede that which be mark for hi trial that day arrive at nine in the morning hi prison door be unlocked and hi gaoler entering command him to follow him he obey with tremble he be conduct into a spacious hall hung with black cloth at the table sit three grave sternlooking men also habit in black one be the grand inquisitor whom the importance of this cause have induce to examine into it himself at a small table at a little distance sit the secretary provide with all necessary implement for write ambrosio be beckon to advance and take hi station at the low end of the table a hi eye glance downwards he perceive various iron instrument lie scatter upon the floor their form be unknown to him but apprehension immediately guess them to be engine of torture he turn pale and with difficulty prevent himself from sink upon the ground profound silence prevail except when the inquisitor whisper a few word among themselves mysteriously near an hour past away and with every second of it ambrosios fear grow more poignant at length a small door opposite to that by which he have enter the hall grate heavily upon it hinge an officer appear and be immediately follow by the beautiful matilda her hair hung about her face wildly her cheek be pale and her eye sunk and hollow she throw a melancholy look upon ambrosio he reply by one of aversion and reproach she be place opposite to him a bell then sound thrice it be the signal for open the court and the inquisitor enter upon their office in these trial neither the accusation be mention or the name of the accuser the prisoner be only ask whether they will confess if they reply that have no crime they can make no confession they be put to the torture without delay this be repeat at interval either till the suspected avow themselves culpable or the perseverance of the examinants be wear out and exhausted but without a direct acknowledgment of their guilt the inquisition never pronounce the final doom of it prisoner in general much time be suffer to elapse without their be question but ambrosios trial have be hasten on account of a solemn auto da fe which would take place in a few day and in which the inquisitor mean this distinguish culprit to perform a part and give a striking testimony of their vigilance the abbot be not merely accuse of rape and murder the crime of sorcery be lay to hi charge as well a to matildas she have be seize a an accomplice in antonias assassination on search her cell various suspicious book and instrument be find which justify the accusation bring against her to criminate the monkthe constellated mirror be produce which matilda have accidentally leave in hi chamber the strange figure engrave upon it catch the attention of don ramirez while search the abbot cell in consequence he carry it away with him it be show to the grand inquisitor who have consider it for some time take off a small golden cross which hung at hi girdle and lay it upon the mirror instantly a loud noise be hear resemble a clap of thunder and the steel shiver into a thousand piece this circumstance confirm the suspicion of the monkhave dealt in magic it be even suppose that hi former influence over the mind of the people be entirely to be ascribe to witchcraft determine to make him confess not only the crime which he have commit but those also of which he be innocent the inquisitor begin their examination though dread the torture a he dread death still more which would consign him to eternal torment the abbot assert hi purity in a voice bold and resolute matilda follow hi example but speak with fear and tremble having in vain exhort him to confess the inquisitor order the monkto be put to the question the decree be immediately execute ambrosio suffer the most excruciating pang that ever be invent by human cruelty yet so dreadful be death when guilt accompany it that he have sufficient fortitude to persist in hi disavowal hi agony be redouble in consequence nor be he release till faint from excess of pain insensibility rescue him from the hand of hi tormentor matilda be next order to the torture but terrify by the sight of the friar suffer her courage totally desert her she sink upon her knee acknowledge her corresponding with infernal spirit and that she have witness the monkassassination of antonia but a to the crime of sorcery she declare herself the sole criminal and ambrosio perfectly innocent the latter assertion meet with no credit the abbot have recover hi sens in time to hear the confession of hi accomplice but he be too much enfeeble by what he have already undergone to be capable at that time of sustain new torment he be command back to hi cell but first inform that as soon a he have gain strength sufficient he must prepare himself for a second examination the inquisitor hop that he would then be less hardened and obstinate to matilda it be announce that she must expiate her crime in fire on the approaching auto da fe all her tear and entreaty could procure no mitigation of her doom and she be drag by force from the hall of trial return to hi dungeon the suffering of ambrosios body be far more supportable than those of hi mind hi dislocated limb the nails torn from hi hand and foot and hi finger mash and break by the pressure of screw be far surpass in anguish by the agitation of hi soul and vehemence of hi terror he saw that guilty or innocent hi judge be bent upon condemn him the remembrance of what hi denial have already cost him terrify him at the idea of be again apply to the question and almost engage him to confess hi crime then again the consequence of hi confession flash before him and render him once more irresolute hi death would be inevitable and that a death the most dreadful he have listen to matildas doom and doubt not that a similar be reserve for him he shudder at the approach auto da fe at the idea of perish in flame and only escape from indurable torment to pass into other more subtile and everlasting with affright do he bend hi mind eye on the space beyond the grave nor could hide from himself how justly he ought to dread heaven vengeance in this labyrinth of terror fain would he have take hi refuge in the gloom of atheism fain would he have deny the soul immortality have persuade himself that when hi eye once close they would never more open and that the same moment would annihilate hi soul and body even this resource be refuse to him to permit hi be blind to the fallacy of this belief hi knowledge be too extensive hi understand too solid and just he could not help feel the existence of a god those truth once hi comfort now present themselves before him in the clearest light but they only serve to drive him to distraction they destroy hi illgrounded hope of escape punishment and dispel by the irresistible brightness of truth and convinction philosophy deceitful vapour fade away like a dream in anguish almost too great for mortal frame to bear he expect the time when he be again to be examine he busy himself in plan ineffectual scheme for escape both present and future punishment of the first there be no possibility of the second despair make him neglect the only mean while reason force him to acknowledge a god existence conscience make him doubt the infinity of hi goodness he disbelieve that a sinner like him could find mercy he have not be deceive into error ignorance could furnish him with no excuse he have see vice in her true colour before he commit hi crime he have compute every scruple of their weight and yet he have commit them pardon he would cry in an access of phrenzy oh there can be none for me persuaded of this instead of humble himself in penitence of deplore hi guilt and employ hi few remaining hour in deprecate heaven wrath he abandon himself to the transport of desperate rage he sorrow for the punishment of hi crime not their commission and exhale hi bosom anguish in idle sigh in vain lamentation in blasphemy and despair a the few beam of day which pierce through the bar of hi prison window gradually disappear and their place be supply by the pale and glimmering lamp he felt hi terror redouble and hi idea become more gloomy more solemn more despondent he dread the approach of sleep no sooner do hi eye close weary with tear and watch than the dreadful vision seem to be realise on which hi mind have dwell during the day he find himself in sulphurous realm and burn cavern surround by fiend appoint hi tormentor and who drive him through a variety of torture each of which be more dreadful than the former amidst these dismal scene wander the ghost of elvira and her daughter they reproach him with their death recount hi crime to the daemon and urge them to inflict torment of cruelty yet more refined such be the picture which float before hi eye in sleep they vanish not till hi repose be disturb by excess of agony then would he start from the ground on which he have stretch himself hi brow run down with cold sweat hi eye wild and phrenzied and he only exchange the terrible certainty for surmizes scarcely more supportable he pace hi dungeon with disordered step he gaze with terror upon the surround darkness and often do he cry oh fearful be night to the guilty the day of hi second examination be at hand he have be compel to swallow cordial whose virtue be calculate to restore hi bodily strength and enable him to support the question longer on the night precede this dread day hi fear for the morrow permit him not to sleep hi terror be so violent a nearly to annihilate hi mental power he sit like one stupefy near the table on which hi lamp be
