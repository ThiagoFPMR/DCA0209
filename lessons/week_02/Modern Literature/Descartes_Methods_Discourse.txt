good sense be of all thing among men the most equally distribute for every one think himself so abundantly provide with it that those even who be the most difficult to satisfy in everything els do not usually desire a large measure of this quality than they already posse and in this it be not likely that all be mistake the conviction be rather to be hold a testifying that the power of judge aright and of distinguish truth from error which be properly what be call good sense or reason be by nature equal in all men and that the diversity of our opinion consequently do not arise from some be endow with a large share of reason than other but solely from this that we conduct our thought along different way and do not fix our attention on the same object for to be possess of a vigorous mind be not enough the prime requisite be rightly to apply it the great mind a they be capable of the high excellence be open likewise to the great aberration and those who travel very slowly may yet make far great progress provide they keep always to the straight road than those who while they run forsake it for myself i have never fancy my mind to be in any respect more perfect than those of the generality on the contrary i have often wish that i be equal to some other in promptitude of thought or in clearness and distinctness of imagination or in fullness and readiness of memory and besides these i know of no other quality that contribute to the perfection of the mind for a to the reason or sense inasmuch a it be that alone which constitute u men and distinguishes u from the brute i be dispose to believe that it be to be find complete in each individual and on this point to adopt the common opinion of philosopher who say that the difference of great and less hold only among the accident and not among the form or nature of individual of the same specie i will not hesitate however to avow my belief that it have be my singular good fortune to have very early in life fall in with certain track which have conduct me to consideration and maxim of which i have form a method that give me the mean a i think of gradually augment my knowledge and of raise it by little and little to the high point which the mediocrity of my talent and the brief duration of my life will permit me to reach for i have already reap from it such fruit that although i have be accustom to think lowly enough of myself and although when i look with the eye of a philosopher at the varied course and pursuit of mankind at large i find scarcely one which do not appear in vain and useless i nevertheless derive the high satisfaction from the progress i conceive myself to have already make in the search after truth and can not help entertain such expectation of the future a to believe that if among the occupation of men a men there be any one really excellent and important it be that which i have choose after all it be possible i may be mistake and it be but a little copper and glass perhaps that i take for gold and diamonds i know how very liable we be to delusion in what relate to ourselves and also how much the judgment of our friend be to be suspect when give in our favor but i shall endeavor in this discourse to describe the path i have follow and to delineate my life a in a picture in order that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself and that in the general opinion entertain of them a gather from current report i myself may have a new help towards instruction to be add to those i have be in the habit of employ my present design then be not to teach the method which each ought to follow for the right conduct of hi reason but solely to describe the way in which i have endeavor to conduct my own they who set themselves to give precept must of course regard themselves a possess of great skill than those to whom they prescribe and if they err in the slight particular they subject themselves to censure but a this tract be put forth merely a a history or if you will a a tale in which amid some example worthy of imitation there will be find perhaps a many more which it be advisable not to follow i hope it will prove useful to some without be hurtful to any and that my openness will find some favor with all from my childhood i have be familiar with letter and a i be give to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of all that be useful in life might be acquire i be ardently desirous of instruction but as soon a i have finish the entire course of study at the close of which it be customary to be admit into the order of the learn i completely change my opinion for i find myself involve in so many doubt and error that i be convince i have advance no far in all my attempt at learn than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance and yet i be study in one of the most celebrated school in europe in which i think there must be learn men if such be anywhere to be find i have be teach all that other learn there and not content with the science actually teach u i have in addition read all the book that have fall into my hand treat of such branch a be esteem the most curious and rare i know the judgment which other have form of me and i do not find that i be consider inferior to my fellow although there be among them some who be already mark out to fill the place of our instructor and in fine our age appear to me a flourish and a fertile in powerful mind a any precede one i be thus lead to take the liberty of judging of all other men by myself and of conclude that there be no science in existence that be of such a nature a i have previously be give to believe i still continue however to hold in esteem the study of the school i be aware that the language teach in them be necessary to the understanding of the writing of the ancient that the grace of fable stir the mind that the memorable deed of history elevate it and if read with discretion aid in form the judgment that the perusal of all excellent book be a it be to interview with the noble men of past age who have write them and even a study interview in which be discover to u only their choice thought that eloquence have incomparable force and beauty that poesy have it ravishing grace and delight that in the mathematics there be many refined discovery eminently suit to gratify the inquisitive as well a further all the art an lessen the labour of man that numerous highly useful precept and exhortation to virtue be contain in treatise on moral that theology point out the path to heaven that philosophy afford the mean of discourse with an appearance of truth on all matter and command the admiration of the more simple that jurisprudence medicine and the other science secure for their cultivator honor and rich and in fine that it be useful to bestow some attention upon all even upon those abound the most in superstition and error that we may be in a position to determine their real value and guard against be deceive but i believe that i have already give sufficient time to language and likewise to the reading of the writing of the ancient to their history and fable for to hold converse with those of other age and to travel be almost the same thing it be useful to know something of the manner of different nation that we may be enable to form a more correct judgment regard our own and be prevent from think that everything contrary to our custom be ridiculous and irrational a conclusion usually come to by those whose experience have be limit to their own country on the other hand when too much time be occupy in travel we become stranger to our native country and the over curious in the custom of the past be generally ignorant of those of the present besides fictitious narrative lead u to imagine the possibility of many event that be impossible and even the most faithful history if they do not wholly misrepresent matter or exaggerate their importance to render the account of them more worthy of perusal omit at least almost always the mean and least striking of the attendant circumstance hence it happen that the remainder do not represent the truth and that such a regulate their conduct by example draw from this source be apt to fall into the extravagance of the knighterrants of romance and to entertain project that exceed their power i esteem eloquence highly and be in rapture with poesy but i think that both be gift of nature rather than fruit of study those in whom the faculty of reason be predominant and who most skillfully dispose their thought with a view to render them clear and intelligible be always the best able to persuade other of the truth of what they lay down though they should speak only in the language of lower brittany and be wholly ignorant of the rule of rhetoric and those whose mind be store with the most agreeable fancy and who can give expression to them with the great embellishment and harmony be still the best poet though unacquainted with the art of poetry i be especially delight with the mathematics on account of the certitude and evidence of their reasoning but i have not as yet a precise knowledge of their true use and think that they but contribute to the advancement of the mechanical art i be astonish that foundation so strong and solid should have have no lofty superstructure rear on them on the other hand i compare the disquisition of the ancient moralist to very tower and magnificent palace with no good foundation than sand and mud they laud the virtue very highly and exhibit them a estimable far above anything on earth but they give u no adequate criterion of virtue and frequently that which they designate with so fine a name be but apathy or pride or despair or parricide i revere our theology and aspire as much a any one to reach heaven but be give assuredly to understand that the way be not less open to the most ignorant than to the most learned and that the revealed truth which lead to heaven be above our comprehension i do not presume to subject them to the impotency of my reason and i think that in order competently to undertake their examination there be need of some special help from heaven and of be more than man of philosophy i will say nothing except that when i saw that it have be cultivate for many age by the most distinguished men and that yet there be not a single matter within it sphere which be not still in dispute and nothing therefore which be above doubt i do not presume to anticipate that my success would be great in it than that of other and further when i consider the number of conflict opinion touch a single matter that may be uphold by learn men while there can be but one true i reckon a wellnigh false all that be only probable a to the other science inasmuch a these borrow their principle from philosophy i judge that no solid superstructure could be rear on foundation so infirm and neither the honor nor the gain hold out by them be sufficient to determine me to their cultivation for i be not thank heaven in a condition which compel me to make merchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune and though i might not profess to scorn glory a a cynic i yet make very slight account of that honor which i hop to acquire only through fictitious title and in fine of false science i think i know the worth sufficiently to escape be deceive by the profession of an alchemist the prediction of an astrologer the imposture of a magician or by the artifice and boasting of any of those who profess to know thing of which they be ignorant for these reason as soon a my age permit me to pass from under the control of my instructor i entirely abandon the study of letter and resolve no long to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself or of the great book of the world i spend the remainder of my youth in travel in visit court and army in hold intercourse with men of different disposition and rank in collect varied experience in prove myself in the different situation into which fortune throw me and above all in make such reflection on the matter of my experience a to secure my improvement for it occur to me that i should find much more truth in the reasoning of each individual with reference to the affair in which he be personally interested and the issue of which must presently punish him if he have judge amiss than in those conduct by a man of letter in hi study regard speculative matter that be of no practical moment and follow by no consequence to himself farther perhaps than that they foster hi vanity the good the more remote they be from common sense require a they must in this case the exercise of great ingenuity and art to render them probable in addition i have always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true from the false in order that i might be able clearly to discriminate the right path in life and proceed in it with confidence it be true that while busy only in consider the manner of other men i find here too scarce any ground for settle conviction and remark hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinion of the philosopher so that the great advantage i derive from the study consist in this that observe many thing which however extravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension be yet by common consent receive and approve by other great nation i learn to entertain too decide a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of which i have be persuade merely by example and custom and thus i gradually extricate myself from many error powerful enough to darken our natural intelligence and incapacitate u in great measure from listen to reason but after i have be occupy several year in thus study the book of the world and in essay to gather some experience i at length resolve to make myself an object of study and to employ all the power of my mind in choose the path i ought to follow an undertaking which be accompany with great success than it would have be have i never quit my country or my book i be then in germany attract thither by the war in that country which have not yet be bring to a termination and a i be return to the army from the coronation of the emperor the setting in of winter arrest me in a locality where a i find no society to interest me and be besides fortunately undisturbed by any care or passion i remain the whole day in seclusion with full opportunity to occupy my attention with my own thought of these one of the very first that occur to me be that there be seldom so much perfection in work compose of many separate part upon which different hand have be employ a in those complete by a single master thus it be observable that the building which a single architect have plan and execute be generally more elegant and commodious than those which several have attempt to improve by make old wall serve for purpose for which they be not originally build thus also those ancient city which from be at first only village have become in course of time large town be usually but ill lay out compare with the regularity construct town which a professional architect have freely plan on an open plain so that although the several building of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of the latter yet when one observe their indiscriminate juxtaposition there a large one and here a small and the consequent crookedness and irregularity of the street one be dispose to allege that chance rather than any human will guide by reason must have lead to such an arrangement and if we consider that nevertheless there have be at all time certain officer whose duty it be to see that private building contribute to public ornament the difficulty of reach high perfection with but the material of other to operate on will be readily acknowledge in the same way i fancy that those nation which start from a semibarbarous state and advance to civilization by slow degree have have their law successively determine and a it be force upon them simply by experience of the hurt of particular crime and dispute would by this process come to be possess of less perfect institution than those which from the commencement of their association a community have follow the appointment of some wise legislator it be thus quite certain that the constitution of the true religion the ordinance of which be derive from god must be incomparably superior to that of every other and to speak of human affair i believe that the preeminence of sparta be due not to the goodness of each of it law in particular for many of these be very strange and even oppose to good moral but to the circumstance that originate by a single individual they all tend to a single end in the same way i think that the science contain in book such of them at least a be make up of probable reasoning without demonstration compose a they be of the opinion of many different individual mass together be far remove from truth than the simple inference which a man of good sense use hi natural and unprejudiced judgment draw respect the matter of hi experience and because we have all to pass through a state of infancy to manhood and have be of necessity for a length of time govern by our desire and preceptor whose dictate be frequently conflict while neither perhaps always counsel u for the best i far conclude that it be almost impossible that our judgment can be so correct or solid a they would have be have our reason be mature from the moment of our birth and have we always be guide by it alone it be true however that it be not customary to pull down all the house of a town with the single design of rebuild them differently and thereby render the street more handsome but it often happen that a private individual take down hi own with the view of erect it anew and that people be even sometimes constrain to this when their house be in danger of fall from age or when the foundation be insecure with this before me by way of example i be persuade that it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think of reform a state by fundamentally change it throughout and overturn it in order to set it up amend and the same i think be true of any similar project for reform the body of the science or the order of teach them establish in the school but a for the opinion which up to that time i have embrace i think that i could not do good than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away that i might afterwards be in a position to admit either other more correct or even perhaps the same when they have undergo the scrutiny of reason i firmly believe that in this way i should much good succeed in the conduct of my life than if i build only upon old foundation and lean upon principle which in my youth i have take upon trust for although i recognize various difficulty in this undertaking these be not however without remedy nor once to be compare with such a attend the slight reformation in public affair large body if once overthrow be with great difficulty set up again or even keep erect when once seriously shake and the fall of such be always disastrous then if there be any imperfection in the constitution of state and that many such exist the diversity of constitution be alone sufficient to assure u custom have without doubt materially smooth their inconvenience and have even manage to steer altogether clear of or insensibly correct a number which sagacity could not have provide against with equal effect and in fine the defect be almost always more tolerable than the change necessary for their removal in the same manner that highways which wind among mountain by be much frequent become gradually so smooth and commodious that it be much good to follow them than to seek a straight path by climb over the top of rock and descend to the bottom of precipice hence it be that i can not in any degree approve of those restless and busy meddler who call neither by birth nor fortune to take part in the management of public affair be yet always project reform and if i think that this tract contain aught which might justify the suspicion that i be a victim of such folly i would by no mean permit it publication i have never contemplate anything high than the reformation of my own opinion and base them on a foundation wholly my own and although my own satisfaction with my work have lead me to present here a draft of it i do not by any mean therefore recommend to every one els to make a similar attempt those whom god have endow with a large measure of genius will entertain perhaps design still more exalted but for the many i be much afraid l even the present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to imitate the single design to strip one self of all past belief be one that ought not to be take by every one the majority of men be compose of two class for neither of which would this be at all a befitting resolution in the first place of those who with more than a due confidence in their own power be precipitate in their judgment and want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect thinking whence it happen that if men of this class once take the liberty to doubt of their accustomed opinion and quit the beaten highway they will never be able to thread the byway that would lead them by a short course and will lose themselves and continue to wander for life in the second place of those who possess of sufficient sense or modesty to determine that there be other who excel them in the power of discriminate between truth and error and by whom they may be instruct ought rather to content themselves with the opinion of such than trust for more correct to their own reason for my own part i should doubtless have belong to the latter class have i receive instruction from but one master or have i never know the diversity of opinion that from time immemorial have prevail among men of the great learning but i have become aware even so early a during my college life that no opinion however absurd and incredible can be imagine which have not be maintain by some on of the philosopher and afterwards in the course of my travel i remark that all those whose opinion be decidedly repugnant to ours be not in that account barbarian and savage but on the contrary that many of these nation make an equally good if not well use of their reason than we do i take into account also the very different character which a person bring up from infancy in france or germany exhibit from that which with the same mind originally this individual would have possess have he live always among the chinese or with savage and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion which please u ten year ago and which may again perhaps be receive into favor before ten year have go appear to u at this moment extravagant and ridiculous i be thus lead to infer that the ground of our opinion be far more custom and example than any certain knowledge and finally although such be the ground of our opinion i remark that a plurality of suffrage be no guarantee of truth where it be at all of difficult discovery a in such case it be much more likely that it will be find by one than by many i could however select from the crowd no one whose opinion seem worthy of preference and thus i find myself constrain a it be to use my own reason in the conduct of my life but like one walk alone and in the dark i resolve to proceed so slowly and with such circumspection that if i do not advance far i would at least guard against fall i do not even choose to dismiss summarily any of the opinion that have creep into my belief without have be introduce by reason but first of all take sufficient time carefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task i be set myself and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my power among the branch of philosophy i have at an early period give some attention to logic and among those of the mathematics to geometrical analysis and algebrathree art or science which ought a i conceive to contribute something to my design but on examination i find that a for logic it syllogism and the majority of it other precept be of availrather in the communication of what we already know or even a the art of lully in speak without judgment of thing of which we be ignorant than in the investigation of the unknown and although this science contain indeed a number of correct and very excellent precept there be nevertheless so many other and these either injurious or superfluous mingle with the former that it be almost quite a difficult to effect a severance of the true from the false a it be to extract a diana or a minerva from a rough block of marble then a to the analysis of the ancient and the algebra of the modern besides that they embrace only matter highly abstract and to appearance of no use the former be so exclusively restrict to the consideration of figure that it can exercise the understand only on condition of greatly fatigue the imagination and in the latter there be so complete a subjection to certain rule and formulas that there result an art full of confusion and obscurity calculate to embarrass instead of a science fit to cultivate the mind by these consideration i be induce to seek some other method which would comprise the advantage of the three and be exempt from their defect and a a multitude of law often only hamper justice so that a state be best govern when with few law these be rigidly administer in like manner instead of the great number of precept of which logic be compose i believe that the four follow would prove perfectly sufficient for me provide i take the firm and unwavering resolution never in a single instance to fail in observe them the first be never to accept anything for true which i do not clearly know to be such that be to say carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what be present to my mind so clearly and distinctly a to exclude all ground of doubt the second to divide each of the difficulty under examination into a many part a possible and a might be necessary for it adequate solution the third to conduct my thought in such order that by commence with object the simple and easy to know i might ascend by little and little and a it be step by step to the knowledge of the more complex assigning in thought a certain order even to those object which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and sequence and the last in every case to make enumeration so complete and review so general that i might be assure that nothing be omit the long chain of simple and easy reasoning by mean of which geometer be accustom to reach the conclusion of their most difficult demonstration have lead me to imagine that all thing to the knowledge of which man be competent be mutually connect in the same way and that there be nothing so far remove from u a to be beyond our reach or so hidden that we can not discover it provide only we abstain from accept the false for the true and always preserve in our thought the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another and i have little difficulty in determine the object with which it be necessary to commence for i be already persuade that it must be with the simplest and easy to know and consider that of all those who have hitherto seek truth in the science the mathematician alone have be able to find any demonstration that be any certain and evident reason i do not doubt but that such must have be the rule of their investigation i resolve to commence therefore with the examination of the simple object not anticipate however from this any other advantage than that to be find in accustom my mind to the love and nourishment of truth and to a distaste for all such reasoning a be unsound but i have no intention on that account of attempt to master all the particular science commonly denominate mathematics but observe that however different their object they all agree in consider only the various relation or proportion subsist among those object i think it best for my purpose to consider these proportion in the most general form possible without refer them to any object in particular except such a would most facilitate the knowledge of them and without by any mean restrict them to these that afterwards i might thus be the good able to apply them to every other class of object to which they be legitimately applicable perceive further that in order to understand these relation i should sometimes have to consider them one by one and sometimes only to bear them in mind or embrace them in the aggregate i think that in order the good to consider them individually i should view them a subsist between straight line than which i could find no object more simple or capable of be more distinctly represent to my imagination and sens and on the other hand that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an aggregate of many i should express them by certain character the brief possible in this way i believe that i could borrow all that be best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra and correct all the defect of the one by help of the other and in point of fact the accurate observance of these few precept give me i take the liberty of say such ease in unravel all the question embrace in these two science that in the two or three month i devote to their examination not only do i reach solution of question i have formerly deem exceedingly difficult but even a regard question of the solution of which i continue ignorant i be enable a it appear to me to determine the mean whereby and the extent to which a solution be possible result attributable to the circumstance that i commence with the simplest and most general truth and that thus each truth discover be a rule available in the discovery of subsequent one nor in this perhaps shall i appear too vain if it be consider that a the truth on any particular point be one whoever apprehend the truth know all that on that point can be know the child for example who have be instruct in the element of arithmetic and have make a particular addition accord to rule may be assure that he have find with respect to the sum of the number before him and that in this instance be within the reach of human genius now in conclusion the method which teach adherence to the true order and an exact enumeration of all the condition of the thing seek include all that give certitude to the rule of arithmetic but the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method be the assurance i have of thereby exercise my reason in all matter if not with absolute perfection at least with the great attainable by me besides i be conscious that by it use my mind be become gradually habituate to clearer and more distinct conception of it object and i hop also from not have restrict this method to any particular matter to apply it to the difficulty of the other science with not less success than to those of algebra i should not however on this account have venture at once on the examination of all the difficulty of the science which present themselves to me for this would have be contrary to the order prescribe in the method but observe that the knowledge of such be dependent on principle borrow from philosophy in which i find nothing certain i think it necessary first of all to endeavor to establish it principle and because i observe besides that an inquiry of this kind be of all other of the great moment and one in which precipitancy and anticipation in judgment be most to be dread i think that i ought not to approach it till i have reach a more mature age be at that time but twentythree and have first of all employ much of my time in preparation for the work as well by eradicate from my mind all the erroneous opinion i have up to that moment accept a by amass variety of experience to afford material for my reasoning and by continually exercise myself in my chosen method with a view to increase skill in it application and finally a it be not enough before commence to rebuild the house in which we live that it be pull down and material and builder provide or that we engage in the work ourselves accord to a plan which we have beforehand carefully draw out but a it be likewise necessary that we be furnish with some other house in which we may live commodiously during the operation so that i might not remain irresolute in my action while my reason compel me to suspend my judgement and that i might not be prevent from live thenceforward in the great possible felicity i form a provisory code of moral compose of three or four maxim with which i be desirous to make you acquaint the first be to obey the law and custom of my country adhere firmly to the faith in which by the grace of god i have be educate from my childhood and regulate my conduct in every other matter accord to the most moderate opinion and the farthest remove from extreme which should happen to be adopt in practice with general consent of the most judicious of those among whom i might be live for a i have from that time begin to hold my own opinion for nought because i wish to subject them all to examination i be convince that i could not do good than follow in the meantime the opinion of the most judicious and although there be some perhaps among the persian and chinese as judicious a among ourselves expediency seem to dictate that i should regulate my practice conformably to the opinion of those with whom i should have to live and it appear to me that in order to ascertain the real opinion of such i ought rather to take cognizance of what they practise than of what they say not only because in the corruption of our manner there be few disposed to speak exactly a they believe but also because very many be not aware of what it be that they really believe for a the act of mind by which a thing be believe be different from that by which we know that we believe it the one act be often find without the other also amid many opinion hold in equal repute i choose always the most moderate a much for the reason that these be always the most convenient for practice and probably the best for all excess be generally vicious a that in the event of my fall into error i might be at less distance from the truth than if have choose one of the extreme it should turn out to be the other which i ought to have adopt and i place in the class of extreme especially all promise by which somewhat of our freedom be abridge not that i disapprove of the law which to provide against the instability of men of feeble resolution when what be seek to be accomplish be some good permit engagement by vow and contract bind the party to persevere in it or even for the security of commerce sanction similar engagement where the purpose seek to be realize be indifferent but because i do not find anything on earth which be wholly superior to change and because for myself in particular i hop gradually to perfect my judgment and not to suffer them to deteriorate i would have deem it a grave sin against good sense if for the reason that i approve of something at a particular time i therefore bound myself to hold it for good at a subsequent time when perhaps it have cease to be so or i have cease to esteem it such my second maxim be to be a firm and resolute in my action a i be able and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinion when once adopt than if they have be highly certain imitating in this the example of traveler who when they have lose their way in a forest ought not to wander from side to side far less remain in one place but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a line a possible without change their direction for slight reason although perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determine the selection for in this way if they do not exactly reach the point they desire they will come at least in the end to some place that will probably be preferable to the middle of a forest in the same way since in action it frequently happen that no delay be permissible it be very certain that when it be not in our power to determine what be true we ought to act accord to what be most probable and even although we should not remark a great probability in one opinion than in another we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other and afterwards consider it in so far a it relate to practice a no longer dubious but manifestly true and certain since the reason by which our choice have be determine be itself possess of these quality this principle be sufficient thenceforward to rid me of all those repentings and pang of remorse that usually disturb the conscience of such feeble and uncertain mind a destitute of any clear and determinate principle of choice allow themselves one day to adopt a course of action a the best which they abandon the next a the opposite my third maxim be to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than fortune and change my desire rather than the order of the world and in general accustom myself to the persuasion that except our own thought there be nothing absolutely in our power so that when we have do our best in thing external to u all wherein we fail of success be to be hold a regard u absolutely impossible and this single principle seem to me sufficient to prevent me from desire for the future anything which i could not obtain and thus render me content for since our will naturally seek those object alone which the understanding represent a in some way possible of attainment it be plain that if we consider all external good a equally beyond our power we shall no more regret the absence of such good a seem due to our birth when deprive of them without any fault of ours than our not possess the kingdom of china or mexico and thus make so to speak a virtue of necessity we shall no more desire health in disease or freedom in imprisonment than we now do body incorruptible a diamond or the wing of bird to fly with but i confess there be need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeat meditation to accustom the mind to view all object in this light and i believe that in this chiefly consist the secret of the power of such philosopher a in former time be enable to rise superior to the influence of fortune and amid suffering and poverty enjoy a happiness which their god might have envy for occupy incessantly with the consideration of the limit prescribe to their power by nature they become so entirely convinced that nothing be at their disposal except their own thought that this conviction be of itself sufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other object and over their thought they acquire a sway so absolute that they have some ground on this account for esteem themselves more rich and more powerful more free and more happy than other men who whatever be the favor heap on them by nature and fortune if destitute of this philosophy can never command the realization of all their desire in fine to conclude this code of moral i think of review the different occupation of men in this life with the view of make choice of the best and without wish to offer any remark on the employment of other i may state that it be my conviction that i could not do good than continue in that in which i be engage viz in devote my whole life to the culture of my reason and in make the great progress i be able in the knowledge of truth on the principle of the method which i have prescribe to myself this method from the time i have begin to apply it have be to me the source of satisfaction so intense a to lead me to believe that more perfect or more innocent could not be enjoy in this life and a by it mean i daily discover truth that appear to me of some importance and of which other men be generally ignorant the gratification thence arise so occupied my mind that i be wholly indifferent to every other object besides the three precede maxim be found singly on the design of continue the work of selfinstruction for since god have endow each of u with some light of reason by which to distinguish truth from error i could not have believe that i ought for a single moment to rest satisfy with the opinion of another unless i have resolve to exercise my own judgment in examine these whenever i should be duly qualify for the task nor could i have proceed on such opinion without scruple have i suppose that i should thereby forfeit any advantage for attain still more accurate should such exist and in fine i could not have restrain my desire nor remain satisfied have i not follow a path in which i think myself certain of attain all the knowledge to the acquisition of which i be competent as well a the large amount of what be truly good which i could ever hope to secure inasmuch a we neither seek nor shun any object except in so far a our understanding represent it a good or bad all that be necessary to right action be right judgment and to the best action the most correct judgment that be to the acquisition of all the virtue with all els that be truly valuable and within our reach and the assurance of such an acquisition can not fail to render u contented have thus provide myself with these maxim and have place them in reserve along with the truth of faith which have ever occupy the first place in my belief i come to the conclusion that i might with freedom set about rid myself of what remain of my opinion and inasmuch a i hop to be well able successfully to accomplish this work by hold intercourse with mankind than by remain long shut up in the retirement where these thought have occur to me i betook me again to travel before the winter be well end and during the nine subsequent year i do nothing but roam from one place to another desirous of be a spectator rather than an actor in the play exhibit on the theater of the world and a i make it my business in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly be doubt and prove a source of error i gradually root out from my mind all the error which have hitherto crept into it not that in this i imitate the sceptic who doubt only that they may doubt and seek nothing beyond uncertainty itself for on the contrary my design be singly to find ground of assurance and cast aside the loose earth and sand that i might reach the rock or the clay in this a appear to me i be successful enough for since i endeavor to discover the falsehood or incertitude of the proposition i examine not by feeble conjecture but by clear and certain reasoning i meet with nothing so doubtful a not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty although this be merely the inference that the matter in question contain nothing certain and just a in pull down an old house we usually reserve the ruin to contribute towards the erection so in destroy such of my opinion a i judge to be illfounded i make a variety of observation and acquire an amount of experience of which i avail myself in the establishment of more certain and far i continue to exercise myself in the method i have prescribe for besides take care in general to conduct all my thought accord to it rule i reserve some hour from time to time which i expressly devote to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical difficulty or even in the solution likewise of some question belong to other science but which by my have detach them from such principle of these science a be of inadequate certainty be render almost mathematical the truth of this will be manifest from the numerous example contain in this volume and thus without in appearance living otherwise than those who with no other occupation than that of spend their life agreeably and innocently study to sever pleasure from vice and who that they may enjoy their leisure without ennui have recourse to such pursuit a be honorable i be nevertheless prosecute my design and make great progress in the knowledge of truth than i might perhaps have make have i be engage in the perusal of book merely or in hold converse with men of letter these nine year pass away however before i have come to any determinate judgment respect the difficulty which form matter of dispute among the learn or have commence to seek the principle of any philosophy more certain than the vulgar and the example of many men of the high genius who have in former time engage in this inquiry but as appear to me without success lead me to imagine it to be a work of so much difficulty that i would not perhaps have venture on it so soon have i not hear it currently rumor that i have already complete the inquiry i know not what be the ground of this opinion and if my conversation contribute in any measure to it rise this must have happen rather from my have confess my ignorance with great freedom than those be accustom to do who have study a little and expound perhaps the reason that lead me to doubt of many of those thing that by other be esteem certain than from my have boast of any system of philosophy but a i be of a disposition that make me unwilling to be esteem different from what i really be i think it necessary to endeavor by all mean to render myself worthy of the reputation accord to me and it be now exactly eight year since this desire constrain me to remove from all those place where interruption from any of my acquaintance be possible and betake myself to this country in which the long duration of the war have lead to the establishment of such discipline that the army maintain seem to be of use only in enable the inhabitant to enjoy more securely the blessing of peace and where in the midst of a great crowd actively engage in business and more careful of their own affair than curious about those of other i have be enable to live without be deprive of any of the convenience to be have in the most populous city and yet a solitary and as retired a in the midst of the most remote desert i be in doubt a to the propriety of make my first meditation in the place above mention matter of discourse for these be so metaphysical and so uncommon a not perhaps to be acceptable to every one and yet that it may be determine whether the foundation that i have lay be sufficiently secure i find myself in a measure constrain to advert to them i have long before remark that in relation to practice it be sometimes necessary to adopt a if above doubt opinion which we discern to be highly uncertain a have be already say but a i then desire to give my attention solely to the search after truth i think that a procedure exactly the opposite be call for and that i ought to reject a absolutely false all opinion in regard to which i could suppose the least ground for doubt in order to ascertain whether after that there remain aught in my belief that be wholly indubitable accordingly see that our sens sometimes deceive u i be willing to suppose that there exist nothing really such a they present to u and because some men err in reasoning and fall into paralogism even on the simple matter of geometry i convince that i be a open to error a any other reject a false all the reasoning i have hitherto take for demonstration and finally when i consider that the very same thought presentation which we experience when awake may also be experience when we be asleep while there be at that time not one of them true i suppose that all the object presentation that have ever enter into my mind when awake have in them no more truth than the illusion of my dream but immediately upon this i observe that whilst i thus wish to think that all be false it be absolutely necessary that i who thus think should be somewhat and a i observe that this truth i think therefore i be cogito ergo sum be so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt however extravagant could be allege by the sceptic capable of shake it i conclude that i might without scruple accept it a the first principle of the philosophy of which i be in search in the next place i attentively examine what i be and a i observe that i could suppose that i have no body and that there be no world nor any place in which i might be but that i could not therefore suppose that i be not and that on the contrary from the very circumstance that i think to doubt of the truth of other thing it most clearly and certainly follow that i be while on the other hand if i have only cease to think although all the other object which i have ever imagine have be in reality existent i would have have no reason to believe that i exist i thence conclude that i be a substance whose whole essence or nature consist only in thinking and which that it may exist have need of no place nor be dependent on any material thing so that i that be to say the mind by which i be what i be be wholly distinct from the body and be even more easily know than the latter and be such that although the latter be not it would still continue to be all that it be after this i inquire in general into what be essential to the truth and certainty of a proposition for since i have discover one which i know to be true i think that i must likewise be able to discover the ground of this certitude and a i observe that in the word i think therefore i be there be nothing at all which give me assurance of their truth beyond this that i see very clearly that in order to think it be necessary to exist i conclude that i might take a a general rule the principle that all the thing which we very clearly and distinctly conceive be true only observe however that there be some difficulty in rightly determine the object which we distinctly conceive in the next place from reflect on the circumstance that i doubt and that consequently my be be not wholly perfect for i clearly saw that it be a great perfection to know than to doubt i be lead to inquire whence i have learn to think of something more perfect than myself and i clearly recognize that i must hold this notion from some nature which in reality be more perfect a for the thought of many other object external to me a of the sky the earth light heat and a thousand more i be less at a loss to know whence these come for since i remark in them nothing which seem to render them superior to myself i could believe that if these be true they be dependency on my own nature in so far a it possess a certain perfection and if they be false that i hold them from nothing that be to say that they be in me because of a certain imperfection of my nature but this could not be the case withthe idea of a nature more perfect than myself for to receive it from nothing be a thing manifestly impossible and because it be not less repugnant that the more perfect should be an effect of and dependence on the less perfect than that something should proceed from nothing it be equally impossible that i could hold it from myself accordingly it but remain that it have be place in me by a nature which be in reality more perfect than mine and which even possess within itself all the perfection of which i could form any idea that be to say in a single word which be god and to this i add that since i know some perfection which i do not possess i be not the only be in existence i will here with your permission freely use the term of the school but on the contrary that there be of necessity some other more perfect being upon whom i be dependent and from whom i have receive all that i possess for if i have exist alone and independently of every other be so a to have have from myself all the perfection however little which i actually possess i should have be able for the same reason to have have from myself the whole remainder of perfection of the want of which i be conscious and thus could of myself have become infinite eternal immutable omniscient allpowerful and in fine have possess all the perfection which i could recognize in god for in order to know the nature of god whose existence have be establish by the precede reasoning as far a my own nature permit i have only to consider in reference to all the property of which i find in my mind some idea whether their possession be a mark of perfection and i be assure that no one which indicate any imperfection be in him and that none of the rest be awanting thus i perceive that doubt inconstancy sadness and such like could not be find in god since i myself would have be happy to be free from them besides i have idea of many sensible and corporeal thing for although i might suppose that i be dream and that all which i saw or imagine be false i could not nevertheless deny that the idea be in reality in my thought but because i have already very clearly recognize in myself that the intelligent nature be distinct from the corporeal and a i observe that all composition be an evidence of dependency and that a state of dependency be manifestly a state of imperfection i therefore determine that it could not be a perfection in god to be compound of these two nature and that consequently he be not so compounded but that if there be any body in the world or even any intelligence or other nature that be not wholly perfect their existence depend on hi power in such a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment i be dispose straightway to search for other truth and when i have represent to myself the object of the geometer which i conceive to be a continuous body or a space indefinitely extend in length breadth and height or depth divisible into diver part which admit of different figure and size and of be move or transpose in all manner of way for all this the geometer suppose to be in the object they contemplate i go over some of their simple demonstration and in the first place i observe that the great certitude which by common consent be accord to these demonstration be found solely upon this that they be clearly conceive in accordance with the rule i have already lay down in the next place i perceive that there be nothing at all in these demonstration which could assure me of the existence of their object thus for example suppose a triangle to be give i distinctly perceive that it three angle be necessarily equal to two right angle but i do not on that account perceive anything which could assure me that any triangle exist while on the contrary recurring to the examination of the idea of a perfect being i find that the existence of the being be comprise in the idea in the same way that the equality of it three angle to two right angle be comprise in the idea of a triangle or a in the idea of a sphere the equidistance of all point on it surface from the center or even still more clearly and that consequently it be at least a certain that god who be this perfect being be or exist a any demonstration of geometry can be but the reason which lead many to persuade them selves that there be a difficulty in know this truth and even also in know what their mind really be be that they never raise their thought above sensible object and be so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of imagination which be a mode of think limited to material object that all that be not imaginable seem to them not intelligible the truth of this be sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance that the philosopher of the school accept a a maxim that there be nothing in the understanding which be not previously in the sens in which however it be certain that the idea of god and of the soul have never be and it appear to me that they who make use of their imagination to comprehend these idea do exactly the some thing a if in order to hear sound or smell odor they strive to avail themselves of their eye unless indeed that there be this difference that the sense of sight do not afford u an inferior assurance to those of smell or hearing in place of which neither our imagination nor our sens can give u assurance of anything unless our understanding intervene finally if there be still person who be not sufficiently persuade of the existence of god and of the soul by the reason i have adduce i be desirous that they should know that all the other proposition of the truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured a that we have a body and that there exist star and an earth and such like be less certain for although we have a moral assurance of these thing which be so strong that there be an appearance of extravagance in doubt of their existence yet at the same time no one unless hi intellect be impair can deny when the question relate to a metaphysical certitude that there be sufficient reason to exclude entire assurance in the observation that when asleep we can in the same way imagine ourselves possess of another body and that we see other star and another earth when there be nothing of the kind for how do we know that the thought which occur in dream be false rather than those other which we experience when awake since the former be often not less vivid and distinct than the latter and though men of the high genius study this question as long a they please i do not believe that they will be able to give any reason which can be sufficient to remove this doubt unless they presuppose the existence of god for in the first place even the principle which i have already take a a rule viz that all the thing which we clearly and distinctly conceive be true be certain only because god be or exists and because he be a perfect being and because all that we possess be derive from him whence it follow that our idea or notion which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness be real and proceed from god must to that extent be true accordingly whereas we not infrequently have idea or notion in which some falsity be contain this can only be the case with such a be to some extent confuse and obscure and in this proceed from nothing participate of negation that be exist in u thus confuse because we be not wholly perfect and it be evident that it be not less repugnant that falsity or imperfection in so far a it be imperfection should proceed from god than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing but if we do not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds from a perfect and infinite being however clear and distinct our idea might be we should have no ground on that account for the assurance that they possess the perfection of be true but after the knowledge of god and of the soul have render u certain of this rule we can easily understand that the truth of the thought we experience when awake ought not in the slight degree to be call in question on account of the illusion of our dream for if it happen that an individual even when asleep have some very distinct idea a for example if a geometer should discover some new demonstration the circumstance of hi be asleep would not militate against it truth and a for the most ordinary error of our dream which consist in their represent to u various object in the same way a our external sens this be not prejudicial since it lead u very properly to suspect the truth of the idea of sense for we be not infrequently deceive in the same manner when awake a when person in the jaundice see all object yellow or when the star or body at a great distance appear to u much small than they be for in fine whether awake or asleep we ought never to allow ourselves to be persuade of the truth of anything unless on the evidence of our reason and it must be note that i say of our reason and not of our imagination or of our sens thus for example although we very clearly see the sun we ought not therefore to determine that it be only of the size which our sense of sight present and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion join to the body of a goat without be therefore shut up to the conclusion that a chimaera exist for it be not a dictate of reason that what we thus see or imagine be in reality existent but it plainly tell u that all our idea or notion contain in them some truth for otherwise it could not be that god who be wholly perfect and veracious should have place them in u and because our reasoning be never so clear or so complete during sleep a when we be awake although sometimes the act of our imagination be then a lively and distinct if not more so than in our waking moment reason further dictate that since all our thought can not be true because of our partial imperfection those possess truth must infallibly be find in the experience of our wake moment rather than in that of our dream i would here willingly have proceed to exhibit the whole chain of truth which i deduce from these primary but a with a view to this it would have be necessary now to treat of many question in dispute among the earn with whom i do not wish to be embroil i believe that it will be good for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truth be that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage i have ever remain firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently avail myself in demonstrate the existence of god and of the soul and to accept a true nothing that do not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstration of the geometer have formerly appear and yet i venture to state that not only have i find mean to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulty which be usually treat of in philosophy but i have also observe certain law establish in nature by god in such a manner and of which he have impress on our mind such notion that after we have reflect sufficiently upon these we can not doubt that they be accurately observe in all that exist or take place in the world and farther by consider the concatenation of these law it appear to me that i have discover many truth more useful and more important than all i have before learn or even have expect to learn but because i have essay to expound the chief of these discovery in a treatise which certain consideration prevent me from publish i can not make the result know more conveniently than by here give a summary of the content of this treatise it be my design to comprise in it all that before i set myself to write it i think i know of the nature of material object but like the painter who find themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different face of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throw the rest into the shade allow them to appear only in so far a they can be see while look at the principal one so fearing l i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that be in my mind i resolve to expound singly though at considerable length my opinion regard light then to take the opportunity of add something on the sun and the fixed star since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heaven since they transmit it on the planet comet and earth since they reflect it and particularly on all the body that be upon the earth since they be either color or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he be the spectator of these object far to enable me to cast this variety of subject somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regard them with great freedom without be necessitate to adopt or refute the opinion of the learn i resolve to leave all the people here to their dispute and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god be now to create somewhere in the imaginary space matter sufficient to compose one and be to agitate variously and confusedly the different part of this matter so that there result a chaos as disorder a the poet ever feign and after that do nothing more than lend hi ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the law which he have establish on this supposition i in the first place describe this matter and essay to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clear and more intelligible except what have be recently say regarding god and the soul for i even expressly suppose that it possess none of those form or quality which be so debate in the school nor in general anything the knowledge of which be not so natural to our mind that no one can so much a imagine himself ignorant of it besides i have point out what be the law of nature and with no other principle upon which to find my reasoning except the infinite perfection of god i endeavor to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt and to prove that they be such that even if god have create more world there could have be none in which these law be not observe thereafter i show how the great part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these law dispose and arrange itself in such a way a to present the appearance of heaven how in the meantime some of it part must compose an earth and some planet and comet and other a sun and fix star and make a digression at this stage on the subject of light i expound at considerable length what the nature of that light must be which be find in the sun and the star and how thence in an instant of time it traverse the immense space of the heaven and how from the planet and comet it be reflect towards the earth to this i likewise added much respect the substance the situation the motion and all the different quality of these heaven and star so that i think i have say enough respect them to show that there be nothing observable in the heaven or star of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i describe i come next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i have expressly suppose that god have give no weight to the matter of which it be compose this should not prevent all it part from tend exactly to it center how with water and air on it surface the disposition of the heaven and heavenly body more especially of the moon must cause a flow and ebb like in all it circumstance to that observe in our sea a also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such a be likewise observe between the tropic how the mountain seas fountain and river might naturally be form in it and the metal produce in the mine and the plant grow in the field and in general how all the body which be commonly denominate mixed or composite might be generate and among other thing in the discovery allude to inasmuch a besides the star i know nothing except fire which produce light i spar no pain to set forth all that pertain to it naturethe manner of it production and support and to explain how heat be sometimes find without light and light without heat to show how it can induce various color upon different body and other diverse quality how it reduce some to a liquid state and harden other how it can consume almost all body or convert them into ash and smoke and finally how from these ash by the mere intensity of it action it form glass for a this transmutation of ash into glass appear to me as wonderful a any other in nature i take a special pleasure in describe it i be not however dispose from these circumstance to conclude that this world have be create in the manner i describe for it be much more likely that god make it at the first such a it be to be but this be certain and an opinion commonly receive among theologian that the action by which he now sustain it be the same with that by which he originally create it so that even although he have from the begin give it no other form than that of chaos provide only he have establish certain law of nature and have lent it hi concurrence to enable it to act a it be wont to do it may be believe without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone thing purely material might in course of time have become such a we observe them at present and their nature be much more easily conceive when they be beheld come in this manner gradually into existence than when they be only consider a produce at once in a finish and perfect state from the description of inanimate body and plant i pass to animal and particularly to man but since i have not a yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner a of the rest that be to say by deduce effect from their cause and by show from what element and in what manner nature must produce them i remain satisfied with the supposition that god form the body of man wholly like to one of ours as well in the external shape of the member a in the internal conformation of the organ of the same matter with that i have describe and at first place in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindle in the heart one of those fire without light such a i have already describe and which i think be not different from the heat in hay that have be heap together before it be dry or that which cause fermentation in new wine before they be run clear of the fruit for when i examine the kind of function which might a consequence of this supposition exist in this body i find precisely all those which may exist in u independently of all power of thinking and consequently without be in any measure owe to the soul in other word to that part of u which be distinct from the body and of which it have be say above that the nature distinctively consist in think function in which the animal void of reason may be say wholly to resemble u but among which i could not discover any of those that as dependent on thought alone belong to u a men while on the other hand i do afterwards discover these as soon a i suppose god to have create a rational soul and to have annex it to this body in a particular manner which i describe but in order to show how i there handle this matter i mean here to give the explication of the motion of the heart and artery which a the first and most general motion observe in animal will afford the mean of readily determine what should be think of all the rest and that there may be less difficulty in understand what i be about to say on this subject i advise those who be not verse in anatomy before they commence the perusal of these observation to take the trouble of get dissect in their presence the heart of some large animal possess of lung for this be throughout sufficiently like the human and to have show to them it two ventricle or cavity in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tube viz the hollow vein vena cava which be the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree a it be of which all the other vein in the body be branch and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated since it be in truth only an artery which take it rise in the heart be divide after pass out from it into many branch which presently disperse themselves all over the lung in the second place the cavity in the left side with which correspond in the same manner two canal in size equal to or large than the precede viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designate because it be simply a vein which come from the lung where it be divide into many branch interlace with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube call the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issue from the heart send it branch all over the body i should wish also that such person be carefully show the eleven pellicle which like so many small valve open and shut the four orifice that be in these two cavity viz three at the entrance of the hollow vein where they be dispose in such a manner a by no mean to prevent the blood which it contain from flow into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent it flow out three at the entrance to the arterial vein which arrange in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contain in this cavity to pass into the lung but hinder that contain in the lung from return to this cavity and in like manner two other at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lung to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude it return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart but prevent it reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicle beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery be of an oval shape from the nature of it situation can be adequately close with two whereas the other be round be more conveniently close with three besides i wish such person to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein be of much harder and firm texture than the venous artery and the hollow vein and that the two last expand before enter the heart and there form a it be two pouch denominate the auricle of the heart which be compose of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there be always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the bodyand finally that this heat be capable of cause any drop of blood that pass into the cavity rapidly to expand and dilate just a all liquor do when allow to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel for after these thing it be not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when it cavity be not full of blood into these the blood of necessity flowsfrom the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessel be always full of blood and their orifice which be turn towards the heart can not then be close but as soon a two drop of blood have thus pass one into each of the cavity these drop which can not but be very large because the orifice through which they pass be wide and the vessel from which they come full of blood be immediately rarefy and dilate by the heat they meet with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valve that be at the entrance of the two vessel from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from come down into the heart and become more and more rarefy they push open the six small valve that be in the orifice of the other two vessel through which they pass out cause in this way all the branch of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begin to contract a do also the artery because the blood that have enter them have cool and the six small valve close and the five of the hollow vein and of the venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drop of blood which cause the heart and the artery again to expand a before and because the blood which thus enter into the heart pass through these two pouch call auricle it thence happen that their motion be the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expand they contract but l those who be ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstration and who be not accustom to distinguish true reason from mere verisimilitude should venture without examination to deny what have be say i wish it to be consider that the motion which i have now explain follow a necessarily from the very arrangement of the part which may be observe in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the finger and from the nature of the blood a learn from experience a do the motion of a clock from the power the situation and shape of it counterweight and wheel but if it be ask how it happen that the blood in the vein flow in this way continually into the heart be not exhaust and why the artery do not become too full since all the blood which pass through the heart flow into them i need only mention in reply what have be write by a physician of england who have the honor of have break the ice on this subject and of have be the first to teach that there be many small passage at the extremity of the artery through which the blood receive by them from the heart pass into the small branch of the vein whence it again return to the heart so that it course amount precisely to a perpetual circulation of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeon who by bind the arm with a tie of moderate strait above the part where they open the vein cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have do without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen be they to bind it below that be between the hand and the opening or be to make the ligature above the opening very tight for it be manifest that the tie moderately straighten while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from return towards the heart by the vein can not on that account prevent new blood from come forward through the artery because these be situate below the vein and their covering from their great consistency be more difficult to compress and also that the blood which come from the heart tend to pass through them to the hand with great force than it do to return from the hand to the heart through the vein and since the latter current escape from the arm by the opening make in one of the vein there must of necessity be certain passage below the ligature that be towards the extremity of the arm through which it can come thither from the artery this physician likewise abundantly establish what he have advance respect the motion of the blood from the existence of certain pellicle so dispose in various place along the course of the vein in the manner of small valve a not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the extremity but only to return from the extremity to the heart and farther from experience which show that all the blood which be in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that have be cut even although this have be closely tie in the immediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the ligature so a to prevent the supposition that the blood flow out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there be many other circumstance which evince that what i have allege be the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that be observe between the blood which flow from the vein and that from the artery can only arise from this that be rarefy and a it be distil by pass through the heart it be thin and more vivid and warm immediately after leave the heart in other word when in the artery than it be a short time before pass into either in other word when it be in the vein and if attention be give it will be find that this difference be very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart and be not so evident in part more remote from it in the next place the consistency of the coat of which the arterial vein and the great artery be compose sufficiently show that the blood be impel against them with more force than against the vein and why should the left cavity of the heart and the great artery be wide and large than the right cavity and the arterial vein be it not that the blood of the venous artery have only be in the lung after it have pass through the heart be thin and rarefies more readily and in a high degree than the blood which proceeds immediately from the hollow vein and what can physicians conjecture from feel the pulse unless they know that accord a the blood change it nature it can be rarefy by the warmth of the heart in a high or low degree and more or less quickly than before and if it be inquire how this heat be communicate to the other member must it not be admit that this be effect by mean of the blood which pass through the heart be there heat anew and thence diffuse over all the body whence it happen that if the blood be withdraw from any part the heat be likewise withdraw by the same mean and although the heart be ashot a glow iron it would not be capable of warm the foot and hand a at present unless it continually send thither new blood we likewise perceive from this that the true use of respiration be to bring sufficient fresh air into the lung to cause the blood which flow into them from the right ventricle of the heart where it have be rarefy and a it be change into vapor to become thick and to convert it anew into blood before it flow into the left cavity without which process it would be unfit for the nourishment of the fire that be there this receive confirmation from the circumstance that it be observe of animal destitute of lung that they have also but one cavity in the heart and that in child who can not use them while in the womb there be a hole through which the blood flow from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart and a tube through which it pass from the arterial vein into the grand artery without pass through the lung in the next place how could digestion be carry on in the stomach unless the heart communicate heat to it through the artery and along with this certain of the more fluid part of the blood which assist in the dissolution of the food that have be take in is not also the operation which convert the juice of food into blood easily comprehend when it be consider that it be distil by pass and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred time in a day and what more need be adduce to explain nutrition and the production of the different humor of the body beyond say that the force with which the blood in be rarefied pass from the heart towards the extremity of the artery cause certain of it part to remain in the member at which they arrive and there occupy the place of some other expel by them and that accord to the situation shape or smallness of the pore with which they meet some rather than other flow into certain part in the same way that some sieve be observe to act which by be variously perforate serve to separate different specie of grain and in the last place what above all be here worthy of observation be the generation of the animal spirit which be like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which continually ascend in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrate through the nerve into the muscle and give motion to all the member so that to account for other part of the blood which a most agitated and penetrate be the fit to compose these spirit proceed towards the brain it be not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the artery which carry them thither proceed from the heart in the most direct line and that accord to the rule of mechanic which be the same with those of nature when many object tend at once to the same point where there be not sufficient room for all a be the case with the part of the blood which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weak and less agitated part must necessarily be drive aside from that point by the strong which alone in this way reach it i have expound all these matter with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which i formerly think of publishing and after these i have show what must be the fabric of the nerve and muscle of the human body to give the animal spirit contain in it the power to move the member a when we see head shortly after they have be strike off still move and bite the earth although no longer animate what change must take place in the brain to produce wake sleep and dream how light sound odor taste heat and all the other quality of external object impress it with different idea by mean of the sens how hunger thirst and the other internal affection can likewise impress upon it divers idea what must be understand by the common sense sensus communis in which these idea be receive by the memory which retain them by the fantasy which can change them in various way and out of them compose new idea and which by the same mean distribute the animal spirit through the muscle can cause the member of such a body to move in as many different way and in a manner a suited whether to the object that be present to it sens or to it internal affection a can take place in our own case apart from the guidance of the will nor will this appear at all strange to those who be acquaint with the variety of movement perform by the different automaton or move machine fabricate by human industry and that with help of but few piece compare with the great multitude of bone muscle nerve artery vein and other part that be find in the body of each animal such person will look upon this body a a machine make by the hand of god which be incomparably well arrange and adequate to movement more admirable than be any machine of human invention and here i specially stay to show that be there such machine exactly resemble organ and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal we could have no mean of know that they be in any respect of a different nature from these animal but if there be machine bear the image of our body and capable of imitate our action as far a it be morally possible there would still remain two most certain test whereby to know that they be not therefore really men of these the first be that they could never use word or other sign arrange in such a manner a be competent to u in order to declare our thought to other for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emit vocable and even that it emit some correspondent to the action upon it of external object which cause a change in it organ for example if touch in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it be hurt and such like but not that it should arrange them variously so as appositely to reply to what be say in it presence a men of the low grade of intellect can do the second test be that although such machine might execute many thing with equal or perhaps great perfection than any of u they would without doubt fail in certain other from which it could be discover that they do not act from knowledge but solely from the disposition of their organ for while reason be an universal instrument that be alike available on every occasion these organ on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organ sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrence of life in the way in which our reason enable u to act again by mean of these two test we may likewise know the difference between men and brute for it be highly deserve of remark that there be no men so dull and stupid not even idiot a to be incapable of join together different word and thereby construct a declaration by which to make their thought understood and that on the other hand there be no other animal however perfect or happily circumstanced which can do the like nor do this inability arise from want of organ for we observe that magpie and parrot can utter word like ourselves and be yet unable to speak a we do that be so a to show that they understand what they say in place of which men bear deaf and dumb and thus not less but rather more than the brute destitute of the organ which other use in speaking be in the habit of spontaneously invent certain sign by which they discover their thought to those who be usually in their company have leisure to learn their language and this prove not only that the brute have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little be require to enable a person to speak and since a certain inequality of capacity be observable among animal of the same specie as well a among men and since some be more capable of be instruct than other it be incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of it specie should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of it kind or at least to one that be crackbrained unless the soul of brute be of a nature wholly different from ours and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movement which indicate the passion and can be imitate by machine as well a manifest by animal nor must it be think with certain of the ancient that the brute speak although we do not understand their language for if such be the case since they be endow with many organ analogous to ours they could a easily communicate their thought to u a to their fellow it be also very worthy of remark that though there be many animal which manifest more industry than we in certain of their action the same animal be yet observe to show none at all in many other so that the circumstance that they do good than we do not prove that they be endow with mind for it would thence follow that they possess great reason than any of u and could surpass u in all thing on the contrary it rather prove that they be destitute of reason and that it be nature which act in them accord to the disposition of their organ thus it be see that a clock compose only of wheel and weight can number the hour and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i have after this describe the reasonable soul and show that it could by no mean be educe from the power of matter a the other thing of which i have speak but that it must be expressly create and that it be not sufficient that it be lodge in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move it member but that it be necessary for it to be join and unite more closely to the body in order to have sensation and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man i here enter in conclusion upon the subject of the soul at considerable length because it be of the great moment for after the error of those who deny the existence of god an error which i think i have already sufficiently refute there be none that be more powerful in lead feeble mind astray from the straight path of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brute be of the same nature with our own and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear more than fly and ant in place of which when we know how far they differ we much good comprehend the reason which establish that the soul be of a nature wholly independent of the body and that consequently it be not liable to die with the latter and finally because no other cause be observe capable of destroy it we be naturally lead thence to judge that it be immortal three year have now elapse since i finish the treatise contain all these matter and i be begin to revise it with the view to put it into the hand of a printer when i learn that person to whom i greatly defer and whose authority over my action be hardly less influential than be my own reason over my thought have condemn a certain doctrine in physic publish a short time previously by another individual to which i will not say that i adhere but only that previously to their censure i have observe in it nothing which i could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state and nothing therefore which would have prevent me from give expression to it in write if reason have persuade me of it truth and this lead me to fear l among my own doctrine likewise some one might be find in which i have depart from the truth notwithstanding the great care i have always take not to accord belief to new opinion of which i have not the most certain demonstration and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one this have be sufficient to make me alter my purpose of publish them for although the reason by which i have be induce to take this resolution be very strong yet my inclination which have always be hostile to write book enable me immediately to discover other consideration sufficient to excuse me for not undertake the task and these reason on one side and the other be such that not only be it in some measure my interest here to state them but that of the public perhaps to know them i have never make much account of what have proceed from my own mind and so long a i gather no other advantage from the method i employ beyond satisfy myself on some difficulty belong to the speculative science or endeavor to regulate my action accord to the principle it teach me i never think myself bound to publish anything respect it for in what regard manner every one be so full of hi own wisdom that there might be find a many reformer a head if any be allow to take upon themselves the task of mend them except those whom god have constitute the supreme ruler of hi people or to whom he have give sufficient grace and zeal to be prophet and although my speculation greatly please myself i believe that other have theirs which perhaps please them still more but as soon a i have acquire some general notion respect physic and begin to make trial of them in various particular difficulty have observe how far they can carry u and how much they differ from the principle that have be employ up to the present time i believe that i could not keep them conceal without sin grievously against the law by which we be bind to promote as far a in u lie the general good of mankind for by them i perceive it to be possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life and in room of the speculative philosophy usually teach in the school to discover a practical by mean of which know the force and action of fire water air the star the heaven and all the other body that surround u as distinctly a we know the various craft of our artisan we might also apply them in the same way to all the us to which they be adapt and thus render ourselves the lord and possessor of nature and this be a result to be desire not only in order to the invention of an infinity of art by which we might be enable to enjoy without any trouble the fruit of the earth and all it comfort but also and especially for the preservation of health which be without doubt of all the blessing of this life the first and fundamental one for the mind be so intimately dependent upon the condition and relation of the organ of the body that if any mean can ever be find to render men wise and more ingenious than hitherto i believe that it be in medicine they must be seek for it be true that the science of medicine a it now exist contains few thing whose utility be very remarkable but without any wish to depreciate it i be confident that there be no one even among those whose profession it be who do not admit that all at present know in it be almost nothing in comparison of what remain to be discover and that we could free ourselves from an infinity of malady of body as well a of mind and perhaps also even from the debility of age if we have sufficiently ample knowledge of their cause and of all the remedy provide for u by nature but since i design to employ my whole life in the search after so necessary a science and since i have fall in with a path which seem to me such that if any one follow it he must inevitably reach the end desire unless he be hinder either by the shortness of life or the want of experiment i judge that there could be no more effectual provision against these two impediment than if i be faithfully to communicate to the public all the little i might myself have find and incite men of superior genius to strive to proceed far by contribute each accord to hi inclination and ability to the experiment which it would be necessary to make and also by inform the public of all they might discover so that by the last beginning where those before them have leave off and thus connect the life and labour of many we might collectively proceed much farther than each by himself could do i remark moreover with respect to experiment that they become always more necessary the more one be advance in knowledge for at the commencement it be well to make use only of what be spontaneously present to our sens and of which we can not remain ignorant provide we bestow on it any reflection however slight than to concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomenon the reason of which be that the more uncommon often only mislead u so long a the cause of the more ordinary be still unknown and the circumstance upon which they depend be almost always so special and minute a to be highly difficult to detect but in this i have adopt the follow order first i have essay to find in general the principle or first cause of all that be or can be in the world without take into consideration for this end anything but god himself who have create it and without educe them from any other source than from certain germ of truth naturally exist in our mind in the second place i examine what be the first and most ordinary effect that could be deduce from these cause and it appear to me that in this way i have find heaven star an earth and even on the earth water air fire mineral and some other thing of this kind which of all other be the most common and simple and hence the easy to know afterwards when i wish to descend to the more particular so many diverse object present themselves to me that i believe it to be impossible for the human mind to distinguish the form or specie of body that be upon the earth from an infinity of other which might have be if it have pleased god to place them there or consequently to apply them to our use unless we rise to cause through their effect and avail ourselves of many particular experiment thereupon turn over in my mind i the object that have ever be present to my sens i freely venture to state that i have never observe any which i could not satisfactorily explain by the principle have discover but it be necessary also to confess that the power of nature be so ample and vast and these principle so simple and general that i have hardly observe a single particular effect which i can not at once recognize a capable of be deduce in man different mode from the principle and that my great difficulty usually be to discover in which of these mode the effect be dependent upon them for out of this difficulty can not otherwise extricate myself than by again seek certain experiment which may be such that their result be not the same if it be in the one of these mode at we must explain it a it would be if it be to be explain in the other a to what remain i be now in a position to discern a i think with sufficient clearness what course must be take to make the majority those experiment which may conduce to this end but i perceive likewise that they be such and so numerous that neither my hand nor my income though it be a thousand time large than it be would be sufficient for them all so that accord a henceforward i shall have the mean of make more or few experiment i shall in the same proportion make great or less progress in the knowledge of nature this be what i have hop to make know by the treatise i have write and so clearly to exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the public a to induce all who have the common good of man at heart that be all who be virtuous in truth and not merely in appearance or accord to opinion as well to communicate to me the experiment they have already make a to assist me in those that remain to be make but since that time other reason have occur to me by which i have be lead to change my opinion and to think that i ought indeed to go on commit to write all the result which i deem of any moment as soon a i should have test their truth and to bestow the same care upon them a i would have do have it be my design to publish them this course commend itself to me as well because i thus afford myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly for doubtless that be always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe will be read by many than that which be write merely for our private use and frequently what have seem to me true when i first conceive it have appear false when i have set about commit it to write a because i thus lose no opportunity of advance the interest of the public as far a in me lay and since thus likewise if my writing possess any value those into whose hand they may fall after my death may be able to put them to what use they deem proper but i resolve by no mean to consent to their publication during my lifetime l either the opposition or the controversy to which they might give rise or even the reputation such a it might be which they would acquire for me should be any occasion of my lose the time that i have set apart for my own improvement for though it be true that every one be bind to promote to the extent of hi ability the good of other and that to be useful to no one be really to be worthless yet it be likewise true that our care ought to extend beyond the present and it be good to omit do what might perhaps bring some profit to the living when we have in view the accomplishment of other end that will be of much great advantage to posterity and in truth i be quite willing it should be know that the little i have hitherto learn be almost nothing in comparison with that of which i be ignorant and to the knowledge of which i do not despair of be able to attain for it be much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the science a with those who when grow rich find less difficulty in make great acquisition than they formerly experience when poor in make acquisition of much small amount or they may be compare to the commander of army whose force usually increase in proportion to their victory and who need great prudence to keep together the residue of their troop after a defeat than after a victory to take town and province for he truly engage in battle who endeavor to surmount all the difficulty and error which prevent him from reach the knowledge of truth and he be overcome in fight who admit a false opinion touch a matter of any generality and importance and he require thereafter much more skill to recover hi former position than to make great advance when once in possession of thoroughly ascertained principle a for myself if i have succeed in discover any truth in the science and i trust that what be contain in this volume i will show that i have find some i can declare that they be but the consequence and result of five or six principal difficulty which i have surmount and my encounter with which i reckon a battle in which victory declare for me i will not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing far be want to enable me fully to realize my design than to gain two or three similar victory and that i be not so far advanced in year but that accord to the ordinary course of nature i may still have sufficient leisure for this end but i conceive myself the more bound to husband the time that remain the great my expectation of be able to employ it aright and i should doubtless have much to rob me of it be i to publish the principle of my physic for although they be almost all so evident that to assent to them no more be need than simply to understand them and although there be not one of them of which i do not expect to be able to give demonstration yet a it be impossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinion of other i foresee that i should frequently be turn aside from my grand design on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to awaken it may be say that these opposition would be useful both in make me aware of my error and if my speculation contain anything of value in bring other to a fuller understanding of it and still far a many can see good than one in lead other who be now begin to avail themselves of my principle to assist me in turn with their discovery but though i recognize my extreme liability to error and scarce ever trust to the first thought which occur to me yetthe experience i have have of possible objection to my view prevents me from anticipate any profit from them for i have already have frequent proof of the judgment a well of those i esteem friend a of some other to whom i think i be an object of indifference and even of some whose malignancy and envy would i know determine them to endeavor to discover what partiality conceal from the eye of my friend but it have rarely happen that anything have be object to me which i have myself altogether overlook unless it be something far remove from the subject so that i have never meet with a single critic of my opinion who do not appear to me either less rigorous or less equitable than myself and far i have never observe that any truth before unknown have be bring to light by the disputation that be practise in the school for while each strives for the victory each be much more occupied in make the best of mere verisimilitude than in weigh the reason on both side of the question and those who have be long good advocate be not afterwards on that account the good judge a for the advantage that other would derive from the communication of my thought it could not be very great because i have not yet so far prosecuted them a that much do not remain to be add before they can be apply to practice and i think i may say without vanity that if there be any one who can carry them out that length it must be myself rather than another not that there may not be in the world many mind incomparably superior to mine but because one can not so well seize a thing and make it one own when it have be learn from another a when one have himself discover it and so true be this of the present subject that though i have often explain some of my opinion to person of much acuteness who whilst i be speak appear to understand them very distinctly yet when they repeat them i have observe that they almost always change them to such an extent that i could no longer acknowledge them a mine i be glad by the way to take this opportunity of request posterity never to believe on hearsay that anything have proceed from me which have not be publish by myself and i be not at all astonish at the extravagance attribute to those ancient philosopher whose own writing we do not possess whose thought however i do not on that account suppose to have be really absurd see they be among the able men of their time but only that these have be falsely represent to u it be observable accordingly that scarcely in a single instance have any one of their disciple surpass them and i be quite sure that the most devoted of the present follower of aristotle would think themselves happy if they have a much knowledge of nature a he possess be it even under the condition that they should never afterwards attain to high in this respect they be like the ivy which never strive to rise above the tree that sustain it and which frequently even return downwards when it have reach the top for it seem to me that they also sink in other word render themselves less wise than they would be if they give up study who not content with know all that be intelligibly explain in their author desire in addition to find in him the solution of many difficulty of which he say not a word and never perhaps so much a think their fashion of philosophize however be well suit to person whose ability fall below mediocrity for the obscurity of the distinction and principle of which they make use enable them to speak of all thing with as much confidence a if they really know them and to defend all that they say on any subject against the most subtle and skillful without it be possible for any one to convict them of error in this they seem to me to be like a blind man who in order to fight on equal term with a person that see should have make him descend to the bottom of an intensely dark cave and i may say that such person have an interest in my refraining from publish the principle of the philosophy of which i make use for since these be of a kind the simplest and most evident i should by publish them do much the same a if i be to throw open the window and allow the light of day to enter the cave into which the combatant have descend but even superior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these principle for if what they desire be to be able to speak of all thing and to acquire a reputation for learn they will gain their end more easily by remain satisfied with the appearance of truth which can be find without much difficulty in all sort of matter than by seek the truth itself which unfold itself but slowly and that only in some department while it oblige u when we have to speak of other freely to confess our ignorance if however they prefer the knowledge of some few truth to the vanity of appear ignorant of none a such knowledge be undoubtedly much to be prefer and if they choose to follow a course similar to mine they do not require for this that i should say anything more than i have already say in this discourse for if they be capable of make great advancement than i have make they will much more be able of themselves to discover all that i believe myself to have find since a i have never examine aught except in order it be certain that what yet remain to be discover be in itself more difficult and recondite than that which i have already be enable to find and the gratification would be much less in learn it from me than in discover it for themselves besides this the habit which they will acquire by seek first what be easy and then pass onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult will benefit them more than all my instruction thus in my own case i be persuade that if i have be teach from my youth all the truth of which i have since seek out demonstration and have thus learn them without labour i should never perhaps have know any beyond these at least i should never have acquire the habit and the facility which i think i possess in always discover new truth in proportion a i give myself to the search and in a single word if there be any work in the world which can not be so well finish by another a by him who have commence it it be that at which i labour it be true indeed a regard the experiment which may conduce to this end that one man be not equal to the task of make them all but yet he can advantageously avail himself in this work of no hand besides hi own unless those of artisan or party of the same kind whom he could pay and whom the hope of gain a mean of great efficacy might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what be prescribe to them for a to those who through curiosity or a desire of learn of their own accord perhaps offer him their service besides that in general their promise exceed their performance and that they sketch out fine design of which not one be ever realize they will without doubt expect to be compensate for their trouble by the explication of some difficulty or at least by compliment and useless speech in which he can not spend any portion of hi time without loss to himself and a for the experiment that other have already make even although these party should be willing of themselves to communicate them to him which be what those who esteem them secret will never do the experiment be for the most part accompany with so many circumstance and superfluous element a to make it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from it adjunctsbesides he will find almost all of them so ill describe or even so false because those who make them have wish to see in them only such fact a they deem conformable to their principle that if in the entire number there should be some of a nature suit to hi purpose still their value could not compensate for the time what would be necessary to make the selection so that if there exist any one whom we assuredly know to be capable of make discovery of the high kind and of the great possible utility to the public and if all other men be therefore eager by all mean to assist him in successfully prosecute hi design i do not see that they could do aught els for him beyond contribute to defray the expense of the experiment that might be necessary and for the rest prevent hi be deprive of hi leisure by the unseasonable interruption of any one but besides that i neither have so high an opinion of myself a to be willing to make promise of anything extraordinary nor feed on imagination so vain a to fancy that the public must be much interested in my design i do not on the other hand own a soul so mean a to be capable of accept from any one a favor of which it could be suppose that i be unworthy these consideration take together be the reason why for the last three year i have be unwilling to publish the treatise i have on hand and why i even resolve to give publicity during my life to no other that be so general or by which the principle of my physic might be understand but since then two other reason have come into operation that have determine me here to subjoin some particular specimen and give the public some account of my doings and design of these consideration the first be that if i fail to do so many who be cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writing might have imagine that the reason which induce me to refrain from so do be less to my credit than they really be for although i be not immoderately desirous of glory or even if i may venture so to say although i be averse from it in so far a i deem it hostile to repose which i hold in great account than aught els yet at the same time i have never seek to conceal my action a if they be crime nor make use of many precaution that i might remain unknown and this partly because i should have think such a course of conduct a wrong against myself and partly because it would have occasion me some sort of uneasiness which would again have be contrary to the perfect mental tranquillity which i court and forasmuch a while thus indifferent to the think alike of fame or of forgetfulness i have yet be unable to prevent myself from acquire some sort of reputation i have think it incumbent on me to do my best to save myself at least from be illspoken of the other reason that have determine me to commit to write these specimen of philosophy be that i be become daily more and more alive to the delay which my design of selfinstruction suffers for want of the infinity of experiment i require and which it be impossible for me to make without the assistance of other and without flatter myself so much a to expect the public to take a large share in my interest i be yet unwilling to be find so far want in the duty i owe to myself a to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it matter of reproach against me some day that i might have leave them many thing in a much more perfect state than i have do have i not too much neglect to make them aware of the way in which they could have promote the accomplishment of my design and i think that it be easy for me to select some matter which should neither be obnoxious to much controversy nor should compel me to expound more of my principle than i desire and which should yet be sufficient clearly to exhibit what i can or can not accomplish in the science whether or not i have succeed in this it be not for me to say and i do not wish to forestall the judgment of other by speak myself of my writing but it will gratify me if they be examine and to afford the great inducement to this i request all who may have any objection to make to them to take the trouble of forward these to my publisher who will give me notice of them that i may endeavor to subjoin at the same time my reply and in this way readers see both at once will more easily determine where the truth lie for i do not engage in any case to make prolix reply but only with perfect frankness to avow my error if i be convince of them or if i can not perceive them simply to state what i think be require for defense of the matter i have write add thereto no explication of any new matte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing to another if some of the matter of which i have speak in the beginning of the dioptrics and meteor should offend at first sight because i call them hypothesis and seem indifferent about give proof of them i request a patient and attentive reading of the whole from which i hope those hesitate will derive satisfaction for it appear to me that the reasoning be so mutually connect in these treatise that a the last be demonstrate by the first which be their cause the first be in their turn demonstrate by the last which be their effect nor must it be imagine that i here commit the fallacy which the logician call a circle for since experience render the majority of these effect most certain the cause from which i deduce them do not serve so much to establish their reality a to explain their existence but on the contrary the reality of the cause be establish by the reality of the effect nor have i call them hypothesis with any other end in view except that it may be know that i think i be able to deduce them from those first truth which i have already expound and yet that i have expressly determine not to do so to prevent a certain class of mind from thence take occasion to build some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my principle and my be blame for it i refer to those who imagine that they can master in a day all that another have take twenty year to think out as soon a he have speak two or three word to them on the subject or who be the more liable to error and the less capable of perceive truth in very proportion a they be more subtle and lively a to the opinion which be truly and wholly mine i offer no apology for them as newpersuaded a i be that if their reason be well consider they will be find to be so simple and so conformed to common sense a to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than any other which can be hold on the same subject nor do i even boast of be the early discoverer of any of them but only of have adopt them neither because they have nor because they have not be hold by other but solely because reason have convince me of their truth though artisan may not be able at once to execute the invention which be explain in the dioptrics i do not think that any one on that account be entitle to condemn it for since address and practice be require in order so to make and adjust the machine describe by me a not to overlook the small particular i should not be less astonished if they succeed on the first attempt than if a person be in one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar by merely have excellent sheet of music set up before him and if i write in french which be the language of my country in preference to latin which be that of my preceptor it be because i expect that those who make use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be good judge of my opinion than those who give heed to the writing of the ancient only and a for those who unite good sense with habit of study whom alone i desire for judge they will not i feel assured be so partial to latin a to refuse to listen to my reasoning merely because i expound them in the vulgar tongue in conclusion i be unwilling here to say anything very specific of the progress which i expect to make for the future in the science or to bind myself to the public by any promise which i be not certain of be able to fulfill but this only will i say that i have resolve to devote what time i may still have to live to no other occupation than that of endeavor to acquire some knowledge of nature which shall be of such a kind a to enable u therefrom to deduce rule in medicine of great certainty than those at present in use and that my inclination be so much oppose to all other pursuit especially to such a can not be useful to some without be hurtful to other that if by any circumstance i have be constrain to engage in such i do not believe that i should have be able to succeed of this i here make a public declaration though well aware that it can not serve to procure for me any consideration in the world which however i do not in the least affect and i shall always hold myself more obliged to those through whose favor i be permit to enjoy my retirement without interruption than to any who might offer me the high earthly preferment
