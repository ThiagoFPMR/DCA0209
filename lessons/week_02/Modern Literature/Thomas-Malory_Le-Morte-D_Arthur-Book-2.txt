after the death of uther pendragon reign arthur hi son the which have great war in hi day for to get all england into hi hand for there be many king within the realm of england and in wale scotland and cornwall so it befall on a time when king arthur be at london there come a knight and tell the king tide how that the king rience of north wale have rear a great number of people and be enter into the land and burnt and slew the king true liege people if this be true say arthur it be great shame unto mine estate but that he be mightily withstand it be truth say the knight for i saw the host myself well say the king let make a cry that all the lord knight and gentleman of arm should draw unto a castle call camelot in those day and there the king would let make a councilgeneral and a great joust so when the king be come thither with all hi baronage and lodge a they seem best there be come a damosel the which be send on message from the great lady lile of avelion and when she come before king arthur she tell from whom she come and how she be send on message unto him for these cause then she let her mantle fall that be richly furred and then be she gird with a noble sword whereof the king have marvel and say damosel for what cause be ye girt with that sword it beseemeth you not now shall i tell you say the damosel this sword that i be girt withal doth me great sorrow and cumbrance for i may not be deliver of this sword but by a knight but he must be a passing good man of hi hand and of hi deed and without villainy or treachery and without treason and if i may find such a knight that hath all these virtue he may draw out this sword out of the sheath for i have be at king riences it be tell me there be pass good knight and he and all hi knight have assay it and none can speed this be a great marvel say arthur if this be sooth i will myself assay to draw out the sword not presume upon myself that i be the best knight but that i will begin to draw at your sword in give example to all the baron that they shall assay everych one after other when i have assay it then arthur take the sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pull at it eagerly but the sword would not out sir say the damosel you need not to pull half so hard for he that shall pull it out shall do it with little might ye say well say arthur now assay ye all my baron but beware ye be not defile with shame treachery nor guile then it will not avail say the damosel for he must be a clean knight without villainy and of a gentle strain of father side and mother side most of all the baron of the round table that be there at that time assay all by row but there might none speed wherefore the damosel make great sorrow out of measure and say ala i weened in this court have be the best knight without treachery or treason by my faith say arthur here be good knight a i deem a any be in the world but their grace be not to help you wherefore i be displeased then fell it so that time there be a poor knight with king arthur that have be prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a knight the which be cousin unto king arthur the name of this knight be call balin and by good mean of the baron he be deliver out of prison for he be a good man name of hi body and he be bear in northumberland and so he go privily into the court and saw this adventure whereof it raise hi heart and he would assay it a other knight do but for he be poor and poorly array he put him not far in press but in hi heart he be fully assure to do as well if hi grace hap him a any knight that there be and a the damosel take her leave of arthur and of all the baron so depart this knight balin call unto her and say damosel i pray you of your courtesy suffer me as well to assay a these lord though that i be so poorly clothe in my heart meseemeth i be fully assure a some of these other and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well the damosel behold the poor knight and saw he be a likely man but for hi poor array she think he should be of no worship without villainy or treachery and then she say unto the knight sir it needeth not to put me to more pain or labour for it seemeth not you to speed there a other have fail ah fair damosel say balin worthiness and good tatches and good deed be not only in array but manhood and worship be hide within man person and many a worshipful knight be not know unto all people and therefore worship and hardiness be not in array by god say the damosel ye say sooth therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may then balin take the sword by the girdle and sheath and draw it out easily and when he look on the sword it please him much then have the king and all the baron great marvel that balin have do that adventure and many knight have great despite of balin cert say the damosel this be a passing good knight and the best that ever i find and most of worship without treason treachery or villainy and many marvel shall he do now gentle and courteous knight give me the sword again nay say balin for this sword will i keep but it be take from me with force well say the damosel ye be not wise to keep the sword from me for ye shall slay with the sword the best friend that ye have and the man that ye most love in the world and the sword shall be your destruction i shall take the adventure say balin that god will ordain me but the sword ye shall not have at this time by the faith of my body ye shall repent it within short time say the damosel for i would have the sword more for your avail than for mine for i be pass heavy for your sake for ye will not believe that sword shall be your destruction and that be great pity with that the damosel depart make great sorrow anon after balin send for hi horse and armour and so would depart from the court and take hi leave of king arthur nay say the king i suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship i suppose ye be displease that i have shew you unkindness blame me the less for i be misinform against you but i weened ye have not be such a knight a ye be of worship and prowess and if ye will abide in this court among my fellowship i shall so advance you a ye shall be pleased god thank your highness say balin your bounty and highness may no man praise half to the value but at this time i must need depart beseech you alway of your good grace truly say the king i be right wroth for your departing i pray you fair knight that ye tarry not long and ye shall be right welcome to me and to my baron and i shall amend all miss that i have do against you god thank your great lordship say balin and therewith make him ready to depart then the most part of the knight of the round table say that balin do not this adventure all only by might but by witchcraft the meanwhile that this knight be make him ready to depart there come into the court a lady that hight the lady of the lake and she come on horseback richly beseen and salute king arthur and there ask him a gift that he promise her when she give him the sword that be sooth say arthur a gift i promise you but i have forget the name of my sword that ye give me the name of it say the lady be excalibur that be as much to

head that bring it i take no force though i have both their head for he slew my brother a good knight and a true and that gentlewoman be causer of my father death truly say king arthur i may not grant neither of their head with my worship therefore ask what ye will els and i shall fulfil your desire i will ask none other thing say the lady when balin be ready to depart he saw the lady of the lake that by her mean have slay balins mother and he have seek her three year and when it be tell him that she ask hi head of king arthur he go to her straight and say evil be you find ye would have my head and therefore ye shall lose yours and with hi sword lightly he smite off her head before king arthur ala for shame say arthur why have ye do so ye have sham me and all my court for this be a lady that i be behold to and hither she come under my safeconduct i shall never forgive you that trespass sir say balin me forthinketh of your displeasure for this same lady be the untrue lady living and by enchantment and sorcery she hath be the destroyer of many good knight and she be causer that my mother be burnt through her falsehood and treachery what cause soever ye have say arthur ye should have forborne her in my presence therefore think not the contrary ye shall repent it for such another despite have i never in my court therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste ye may then balin take up the head of the lady and bare it with him to hi hostelry and there he meet with hi squire that be sorry he have displease king arthur and so they ride forth out of the town now say balin we must depart take thou this head and bear it to my friend and tell them how i have speed and tell my friend in northumberland that my most foe be dead also tell them how i be out of prison and what adventure befall me at the get of this sword ala say the squire ye be greatly to blame for to displease king arthur a for that say balin i will hie me in all the haste that i may to meet with king rience and destroy him either els to die therefore and if it may hap me to win him then will king arthur be my good and gracious lord where shall i meet with you say the squire in king arthur court say balin so hi squire and he depart at that time then king arthur and all the court make great dole and have shame of the death of the lady of the lake then the king bury her richly at that time there be a knight the which be the king son of ireland and hi name be lanceor the which be an orgulous knight and count himself one of the best of the court and he have great despite at balin for the achieving of the sword that any should be account more hardy or more of prowess and he ask king arthur if he would give him leave to ride after balin and to revenge the despite that he have do do your best say arthur i be right wroth with balin i would he be quit of the despite that he hath do to me and to my court then this lanceor go to hi hostelry to make him ready in the meanwhile come merlin unto the court of king arthur and there be tell him the adventure of the sword and the death of the lady of the lake now shall i say you say merlin this same damosel that here standeth that bring the

damosel love another knight that hold her to paramour and this good knight her brother meet with the knight that hold her to paramour and slew him by force of hi hand when this false damosel understood this she go to the lady lile of avelion and beseech her of help to be avenge on her own brother and so this lady lile of avelion take her this sword that she bring with her and tell there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if he be one of the best knight of this realm and he should be hard and full of prowess and with that sword he should slay her brother this be the cause that the damosel come into this court i know it as well a ye would god she have not come into this court but she come never in fellowship of worship to do good but always great harm and that knight that hath achieve the sword shall be destroy by that sword for the which will be great damage for there liveth not a knight of more prowess than he be and he shall do unto you my lord arthur great honour and kindness and it be great pity he shall not endure but a while for of hi strength and hardiness i know not hi match living so the knight of ireland arm him at all point and dress hi shield on hi shoulder and mount upon horseback and take hi spear in hi hand and rode after a great pace as much a hi horse might go and within a little space on a mountain he have a sight of balin and with a loud voice he cry abide knight for ye shall abide whether ye will or nill and the shield that be tofore you shall not help when balin hear the noise he turn hi horse fiercely and say fair knight what will ye with me will ye joust with me yea say the irish knight therefore come i after you peradventure say balin it have be well to have holden you at home for many a man weeneth to put hi enemy to a rebuke and oft it falleth to himself of what court be ye sent from say balin i be come from the court of king arthur say the knight of ireland that come hither for to revenge the despite ye do this

for the lady that be dead do me great damage and els would i have be loath a any knight that liveth for to slay a lady make you ready say the knight lanceor and dress you unto me for that one shall abide in the field then they take their spear and come together as much a their horse might drive and the irish knight smote balin on the shield that all go shiver off hi spear and balin hit him through the shield and the hauberk perish and so pierce through hi body and the horse croup and anon turn hi horse fiercely and draw out hi sword and wist not that he have slay him and then he saw him lie a a dead corpse then he look by him and be ware of a damosel that come rid full fast a the horse might ride on a fair palfrey and when she espy that lanceor be slay she make sorrow out of measure and say o balin two body thou hast slain and one heart and two heart in one body and two soul thou hast lose and therewith she take the sword from her love that lay dead and fell to the ground in a swoon and when she arise she make great dole out of measure the which sorrow grieve balin passingly sore and he go unto her for to have take the sword out of her hand but she hold it so fast he might not take it out of her hand unless he should have hurt her and suddenly she set the pommel to the ground and rove herself through the body when balin espy her deed he be pass heavy in hi heart and ashamed that so fair a damosel have destroy herself for the love of hi death ala say balin me repenteth sore the death of this knight for the love of this damosel for there be much true love betwixt

and kiss together and weep for joy and pity then balan say i little weened to have meet with you at this sudden adventure i be right glad of your deliverance out of your dolorous prison for a man tell

i might not save her for she slew herself suddenly me repenteth say merlin because of the death of that lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man strike except the stroke of our lord for thou shalt hurt the true knight and the man of most worship that now liveth and through that stroke three kingdom shall be in great poverty misery and wretchedness twelve year and the knight shall not be whole of that wound for many year then merlin take hi leave of balin and balin say if i wist it be sooth that ye say i should do such a perilous deed a that i would slay myself to make thee a liar therewith merlin vanish away suddenly and then balan and hi brother take their leave of king mark first say the king tell me your name sir say balan ye may see he beareth two sword thereby ye may call him the knight with the two sword and so departed king mark unto camelot to king arthur and balin take the way toward king rience and a they ride together they meet with merlin disguise but they know him not whither ride you say merlin we have little to do say the two knight to tell thee but what be thy name say balin at this time say merlin i will not tell it thee it be evil see say the knight that thou art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name a for that say merlin be it a it be may i can tell you wherefore ye ride this way for to meet king rience but it will not avail you without ye have my counsel ah say balin ye be merlin we will be rule by your counsel come on say merlin ye shall have great worship and look that ye do knightly for ye shall have great need a for that say balin dread you not we will do what we may then merlin lodge them in a wood among leaf beside the highway and take off the bridle of their horse and put them to grass and lay them down to rest them till it be nigh midnight then merlin bid them rise and make them ready for the king be nigh them that be steal away from hi host with a three score horse of hi best knight and twenty of them ride

in the meanwhile come one to king lot and tell him while he tarry there nero be destroy and slay with all hi people ala say king lot i be ashamed for by my default there be many a worshipful man slain for an we have be together there have be none host under the heaven that have be able for to have match with u this faiter with hi prophecy hath mock me all that do merlin for he know well that an king lot have be with hi body there at the first battle king arthur have be slay and all hi people destroy and well merlin know that one of the king should be dead that day and loath be merlin that any of them both should be slay but of the twain he have liefer king lot have be slay than king arthur now what be best to do say king lot of orkney whether be me good to treat with king arthur or to fight for the great part of our people be slain and destroyed sir say a knight set on arthur for they be weary and forfoughten and we be fresh a for me say king lot i would every knight would do hi

and hi host to the bad but always king lot hold him in the foremost front and do marvellous deed of arm for all hi host be bear up by hi hand for he abide all knight ala he might not endure the which be great pity that so worthy a knight a he be one should be overmatched that of late time afore have be a knight of king arthur and wed the sister of king arthur and for king arthur lay by king lot wife the which be arthur sister and gat on her mordred therefore king lot hold against arthur so there be a knight that be call the knight with the strange beast and at that time hi right name be call pellinore the which be a good man of prowess and he smite a mighty stroke at king lot a he fight with all hi enemy and he fail of hi stroke and smite the horse neck that he fell to the ground with king lot and therewith anon pellinore smite him a great stroke through the helm and head unto the brow and then all the host of orkney flee for the death of king lot and there be slain many mother son but king pellinore bare the wite of the death of king lot wherefore sir gawain revenge the death of hi father the tenth year after he be make knight and slew king pellinore with hi own hand also there be slain at that battle twelve king on the side of king lot with nero and all be bury in the church of saint stephen in camelot and the remnant of knight and of other be bury in a great rock so at the

all these come to the interment but of all these twelve king king arthur let make the tomb of king lot pass richly and make hi tomb by hi own and then arthur let make twelve image of latten and copper and overgilt it with gold in the sign of twelve king and each one of them hold a taper of wax that burnt day and night and king arthur be make in sign of a figure stand above them with a sword drawn in hi hand and all the twelve figure have countenance like unto men that be overcome all this make merlin by hi subtle craft and there he tell the king when i be dead these taper shall burn no longer and soon after the adventure of the sangreal shall come among you and be achieve also he tell arthur how balin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke whereof shall fall great vengeance oh where be balin and balan and pellinore say king arthur a for pellinore say merlin he will meet with you soon and a for balin he will not be long from you but the other brother will depart ye shall see him no more by my faith say arthur they be two marvellous knight and namely balin passeth of prowess of any knight that ever i find for much beholden be i unto him would god he would abide with me sir say merlin look ye keep well the scabbard of excalibur for ye shall lose no blood while ye have the scabbard upon you though ye have as many wound upon you a ye may have so after for great trust arthur betook the scabbard to morgan le fay hi sister and she love another knight well than her husband king uriens or king arthur and she would have have arthur her brother slain and therefore she let make another scabbard like it by enchantment and give the scabbard excalibur to her love and the knight name be call accolon that after have near slain king arthur after this merlin tell unto king arthur of the prophecy that there should be a great battle beside salisbury and mordred hi own son should be against him also he tell him that bagdemegus be hi cousin and germain unto king uriens within a day or two king arthur be somewhat sick and he let pitch hi pavilion in a meadow and there he lay him down on a pallet to sleep but he might have no rest right so he hear a great noise of an horse and therewith the king look out at the porch of the pavilion and saw a knight come even by him make great dole abide fair sir say arthur and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow ye may little amend me say the knight and so passed forth to the castle of meliot anon after there come balin and when he saw king arthur he alight off hi horse and come to the king on foot and salute him by my head say arthur ye be welcome sir right now come rid this way a knight make great mourn for what cause i can not tell wherefore i would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch again that knight either by force or els by hi good will i will do more for your lordship than that say balin and so he ride more than a pace and find the knight with a damosel in a forest and say sir knight ye must come with me unto king arthur for to tell him of your sorrow that will i not say the knight for it will scathe me greatly and do you none avail sir say balin i pray you make you ready for ye must go with me or els i must fight with you and bring you by force and that be me loath to do will ye be my warrant say the knight an i go with you yea say balin or els i will die therefore and so he make him ready to go with balin and leave the damosel still and a they be even afore king arthur pavilion there come one invisible and smite this knight that go with balin throughout the body with a spear ala say the knight i be slain under your conduct with a knight call garlon therefore take my horse that be good than yours and ride to the damosel and follow the quest that i be in a she will lead you and revenge my death when ye may that shall i do say balin and that i make vow unto knighthood and so he depart from this knight with great sorrow so king arthur let bury this knight richly and make a mention on hi tomb how there be slain herlews le berbeus and by whom the treachery be do the knight garlon but ever the damosel bare the truncheon of the spear with her that sir herlews be slain withal so balin and the damosel rode into a forest and there meet with a knight that have be ahunting and that knight ask balin for what cause he make so great sorrow me list not to tell you say balin now say the knight an i be arm a ye be i would fight with you that should little need say balin i be not afeard to tell you and tell him all the cause how it be ah say the knight be this all here i ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you while my life lasteth and so they go to the hostelry and arm them and so rode forth with balin and a they come by an hermitage even by a churchyard there come the knight garlon invisible and smite this knight perin de mountbeliard through the body with a spear ala say the knight i be slain by this traitor knight that rideth invisible ala say balin it be not the first despite he hath do me and there the hermit and balin bury the knight under a rich stone and a tomb royal and on the morn they find letter of gold write how sir gawain shall revenge hi father death king lot on the king pellinore anon after this balin and the damosel rode till they come to a castle and there balin alight and he and the damosel go to go into the castle and anon a balin come within the castle gate the portcullis fell down at hi back and there fell many men about the damosel and would have slay her when balin saw that he be sore aggrieve for he might not help the damosel then he go up into the tower and leapt over wall into the ditch and hurt him not and anon he pull out hi sword and would have foughten with them and they all say nay they would not fight with him for they do nothing but the old custom of the castle and tell him how their lady be sick and have lie many year and she might not be whole but if she have a dish of silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king daughter and therefore the custom of this castle be there shall no damosel pas this way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full well say balin she shall bleed as much a she may bleed but i will not lose the life of her while my life lasteth and so balin make her to bleed by her good will but her blood help not the lady and so he and she rest there all night and have there right good cheer and on the morn they pass on their way and a it telleth after in the sangreal that sir percivales sister help that lady with her blood whereof she be dead then they ride three or four day and never meet with adventure and by hap they be lodge with a gentle man that be a rich man and well at ease and a they sit at their supper balin overheard one complain grievously by him in a chair what be this noise say balin forsooth say hi host i will tell you i be but late at a jousting and there i joust with a knight that be brother

bare down horse and man that they lay both in a swoon but balin be bruise sore with the fall of hi horse for he be weary of travel and balan be the first that rise on foot and draw hi sword and go toward balin and he arose and go against him but balan smite balin first and he put up hi shield and smote him through the shield and tame hi helm then balin smite him again with that unhappy sword and wellnigh have fell hi brother balan and so they fight there together till their breath fail then balin look up to the castle and saw the tower stand full of lady so they go unto battle again and wound everych other dolefully and then they breathe ofttimes and so go unto battle that all the place there a they fight be blood red and at that time there be none of them both but they have either
