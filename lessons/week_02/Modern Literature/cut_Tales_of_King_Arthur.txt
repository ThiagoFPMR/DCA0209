the queen fair igraine make great sorrow and all the baron chapter v how arthur be choose king and of wonder and marvel of a sword take out of a stone by the say arthur then stand the realm in great jeopardy long while for every lord that be mighty of men make him strong and many weened to have be king then merlin go to the archbishop of canterbury and counsel him for to send for all the lord of the realm and all the gentleman of arm that they should to london come by christmas upon pain of cursing and for this cause that jesus that be bear on that night that he would of hi great mercy show some miracle a he be come to be king of mankind for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm so the archbishop by the advice of merlin send for all the lord and gentleman of arm that they should come by christmas even unto london and many of them make them clean of their life that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto god so in the great church of london whether it be paul or not the french book maketh no mention all the estate be long or day in the church for to pray and when matins and the first mass be do there be see in the churchyard against the high altar a great stone four square like unto a marble stone and in midst thereof be like an anvil of steel a foot on high and therein stick a fair sword naked by the point and letter there be write in gold about the sword that say thuswhoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil be rightwise king born of all england then the people marvel and tell it to the archbishop i command say the archbishop that ye keep you within your church and pray unto god still that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all do so when all mass be do all the lord go to behold the stone and the sword and when they saw the scripture some assay such a would have be king but none might stir the sword nor move it he be not here say the archbishop that shall achieve the sword but doubt not god will make him know but this be my counsel say the archbishop that we let purvey ten knight men of good fame and they to keep this sword so it be ordain and then there be make a cry that every man should assay that would for to win the sword and upon new year day the baron let make a joust and a tournament that all knight that would joust or tourney there might play and all this be ordain for to keep the lord together and the common for the archbishop trust that god would make him know that should win the sword so upon new year day when the service be do the baron ride unto the field some to joust and some to tourney and so it happen that sir ector that have great livelihood about london rode unto the joust and with him ride sir kay hi son and young arthur that be hi nourished brother and sir kay be make knight at all hallowmas afore so a they ride to the joustsward sir kay lose hi sword for he have leave it at hi father lodge and so he pray young arthur for to ride for hi sword i will well say arthur and ride fast after the sword and when he come home the lady and all be out to see the jousting then be arthur wroth and say to himself i will ride to the churchyard and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone for my brother sir kay shall not be without a sword this day so when he come to the churchyard sir arthur alight and tie hi horse to the stile and so he go to the tent and find no knight there for they be at the jousting and so he handle the sword by the handle and lightly and fiercely pull it out of the stone and take hi horse and ride hi way until he come to hi brother sir kay and deliver him the sword and as soon a sir kay saw the sword he wist well it be the sword of the stone and so he ride to hi father sir ector and say sir lo here be the sword of the stone wherefore i must be king of this land when sir ector behold the sword he return again and come to the church and there they alight all three and go into the church and anon he make sir kay swear upon a book how he come to that sword sir say sir kay by my brother arthur for he bring it to me how gat ye this sword say sir ector to arthur sir i will tell you when i come home for my brother sword i find nobody at home to deliver me hi sword and so i think my brother sir kay should not be swordless and so i come hither eagerly and pull it out of the stone without any pain found ye any knight about this sword say sir ector nay say arthur now say sir ector to arthur i understand ye must be king of this land wherefore i say arthur and for what cause sir say ector for god will have it so for there should never man have draw out this sword but he that shall be rightwise king of this land now let me see whether ye can put the sword there a it be and pull it out again that be no mastery say arthur and so he put it in the stone wherewithal sir ector assay to pull out the sword and fail chapter vi how king arthur pull out the sword divers time now assay say sir ector unto sir kay and anon he pull at the sword with all hi might but it would not be now shall ye assay say sir ector to arthur i will well say arthur and pull it out easily and therewithal sir ector kneel down to the earth and sir kay ala say arthur my own dear father and brother why kneel ye to me nay nay my lord arthur it be not so i be never your father nor of your blood but i wot well ye be of an high blood than i weened ye be and then sir ector tell him all how he be betaken him for to nourish him and by whose commandment and by merlin deliverance then arthur make great dole when he understand that sir ector be not hi father sir say ector unto arthur will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye be king els be i to blame say arthur for ye be the man in the world that i be most beholden to and my good lady and mother your wife that as well a her own hath foster me and keep and if ever it be god will that i be king a ye say ye shall desire of me what i may do and i shall not fail you god forbid i should fail you sir say sir ector i will ask no more of you but that ye will make my son your foster brother sir kay seneschal of all your land that shall be do say arthur and more by the faith of my body that never man shall have that office but he while he and i live therewithal they go unto the archbishop and tell him how the sword be achieve and by whom and on twelfthday all the baron come thither and to assay to take the sword who that would assay but there afore them all there might none take it out but arthur wherefore there be many lord wroth and say it be great shame unto them all and the realm to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood born and so they fell out at that time that it be put off till candlemas and then all the baron should meet there again but always the ten knight be ordain to watch the sword day and night and so they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword and five always watch so at candlemas many more great lord come thither for to have win the sword but there might none prevail and right a arthur do at christmas he do at candlemas and pull out the sword easily whereof the baron be sore aggrieve and put it off in delay till the high feast of easter and a arthur speed before so do he at easter yet there be some of the great lord have indignation that arthur should be king and put it off in a delay till the feast of pentecost then the archbishop of canterbury by merlin providence let purvey then of the best knight that they might get and such knight a uther pendragon love best and most trust in hi day and such knight be put about arthur a sir

officer and at the feast of pentecost all manner of men assay to pull at the sword that would assay but none might prevail but arthur and pull it out afore all the lord and common that be there wherefore all the common cry at once we will have arthur unto our king we will put him no more in delay for we all see that it be god will that he shall be our king and who that holdeth against it we will slay him and therewithal they kneel at once both rich and poor and cry arthur mercy because they have delay him so long and arthur forgive them and take the sword between both hi hand and offer it upon the altar where the archbishop be and so be he make knight of the best man that be there and so anon be the coronation make and there be he swear unto hi lord and the common for to be a true

blood and send him word they would none of hi gift but that they be come to give him gift with hard sword betwixt the neck and the shoulder and therefore they come thither so they tell to the messenger plainly for it be great shame to all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a realm a this land be with this answer the messenger depart and tell to king arthur this answer wherefore by the advice of hi baron he take him to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him and all the king aforesaid in a manner lay a siege tofore him but king arthur be well victualed and within fifteen day there come merlin among them into the city of carlion then all the king be pass glad of merlin and ask him for what cause be that boy arthur make your king sir say merlin i

die he shall be long king of all england and have under hi obeissance wale ireland and scotland and more realm than i will now rehearse some of the king have marvel of merlin word and deem well that it should be a he say and some of them laugh him to scorn a king lot and more other call him a witch but then be they accord with merlin that king arthur should come out and speak with the king and to come safe and to go safe such surance there be make so merlin go unto king arthur and tell him how he have do and bid him fear not but come out boldly and speak with them and spare them not but answer them a their king and chieftain for ye shall overcome them all whether they will or nill chapter ix of the first war that king arthur have and how he win the field then king arthur come out of hi

that be with him and when they be meet there be no meekness but stout word on both side but always king arthur answer them and say he would make them to bow an he live wherefore they depart with wrath and king arthur bid keep them well and they bid the king keep him well so the king return him to the tower again and arm him and all hi knight what will ye do say merlin to the king ye be good for to stint for ye shall not here prevail though ye be ten time so many be we well advise to be afeared of a dreamreader say king lot with that merlin vanish away and come to king arthur and bid him set on them fiercely and in the meanwhile there be three hundred good men of the best that be with the king that go straight unto king arthur and that comfort him greatly sir say merlin to arthur fight not with the sword that ye have by miracle till that ye see ye go unto the bad then draw it out and do your best so forthwith king arthur set upon them in their lodging and sir baudwin sir kay and sir brastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it be marvel and always king arthur on horseback lay on with a sword and do marvellous deed of arm that many of the king have great joy of hi deed and hardiness then king lot brake out on the back side and the king with the hundred knight and king carados and set on arthur fiercely behind him with that sir arthur turn with hi knight and

on horseback then he draw hi sword excalibur but it be so bright in hi enemy eye that it give light like thirty torch and therewith he put them aback and slew much people and then the common of carlion arose with club and stave and slew many knight but all the king hold them together with their knight that be leave alive and so fled and departed and merlin come unto arthur and counsel him to follow them no further chapter x how merlin counsel king arthur to send for king ban and king bors and of their counsel take for the war so after the feast and journey king arthur draw him unto london and so by the counsel of merlin the king let call hi baron to council for merlin have tell the king that the six king that make war upon him would in all haste be awroke on him and on hi land wherefore the king ask counsel at them all they could no counsel give but say they be big enough ye say well say arthur i thank you for your good courage but will ye all that loveth me speak with merlin ye know well that he hath do much for me and he knoweth many thing and when he be afore you i would that ye pray him heartily of hi best advice all the baron say they would pray him and desire him so merlin be send for and fair desire of all the baron to give them best counsel i shall say you say merlin i warn you all your enemy be pass strong for you and they be good men of arm a be alive and by this time they have get to them four king more and a mighty duke and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than he may make within the bound of hi own realm an he fight with them in battle he shall be overcome and slay what be best to do in this cause say all the baron i shall tell you say merlin mine advice there be two brother beyond the sea and they be kings both and marvellous good men of their hand and that one hight king ban of benwick and that other hight king bors of gaul that be france and on these two king warreth a mighty man of men the king claudas and striveth with them for a castle and great war be betwixt them but this claudas be so mighty of good whereof he getteth good knight that he putteth these two king most part to the bad wherefore this be my counsel that our king and sovereign lord send unto the king ban and bors by two trusty knight with letter well devise that an they will come and see king arthur and hi court and so help him in hi war that he will be swear unto them to help them in their war against king claudas now what say ye unto this counsel say merlin this be well counsel say the king and all the baron right so in all haste there be ordain to go two knight on the message unto the two king so be there make letter in the pleasant wise accord unto king arthur desire ulfius and brastias be make the messenger and so rode forth well horse and well armed and a the guise be that time and so pass the sea and rode toward the city of benwick and there besides be eight knight that espy them and at a strait passage they meet with ulfius and brastias and would have take them prisoner so they pray them that they might pass for they be messenger unto king ban and bors send from king arthur therefore say the eight knight

knight brake their spear and theirs toheld and bare the two knight out of their saddle to the earth and so leave them lie and ride their way and the other six knight ride afore to a passage to meet with them again and so ulfius and brastias smite other two down and so pass on their way and at the fourth passage there meet two for two and both be lay unto the earth so there be none of the eight knight but he be sore hurt or bruise and when they come to benwick it fortuned there be both king ban and bors and when it be tell the king that there be come messenger there be send unto them two knight of worship the one hight lionses lord of the country of payarne and sir phariance a worshipful knight anon they ask from whence they come and they say from king arthur king of england so they take them in their arm and make great joy each of other but anon a the two king wist they be messenger of arthur there be make no tarry but forthwith they spake with the knight and welcome them in the faithfullest wise and say they be most welcome unto them before all the king living and therewith they kiss the letter and deliver them and when ban and bors understand the letter then they be more welcome than they be before and after the haste of the letter they give them this answer that they would fulfil the desire of king arthur writing and ulfius and brastias tarry there as long a they would they should have such cheer a might be make them in those march then ulfius and brastias tell the king of the adventure at their passage of the eight knight ha ah say ban and bors they be my good friend i would i have wist of them they should not have escape so so ulfius and brastias have good cheer and great gift as much a they might bear away and have their answer by mouth and by write that those two king would come unto arthur in all the haste that they might so the two knight ride on afore and pass the sea and come to their lord and tell him how they have speed whereof king arthur be pass glad at what time suppose ye the two king will be here sir say they afore all hallowmas then the king let purvey for a great feast and let cry a great joust and by all hallowmas the two king be come over the sea with three hundred knight well arrayed both for the peace and for the war and king arthur meet with them ten mile out of london and there be great joy a could be think or make and on all hallowmas at the great feast sit in the hall the three king and sir kay seneschal serve in the hall and sir lucas the butler that be duke corneus son and sir griflet that be the son of cardol these three knight have the rule of all the service that serve the king and anon a they have washen and rise all knight that would joust make them ready by then they be ready on horseback there be seven hundred knight and arthur ban and bors with the archbishop of canterbury and sir ector kays father they be in a place cover with cloth of gold like an hall with lady and gentlewoman for to

the seven hundred knight in two party and there be three hundred knight of the realm of benwick and of gaul turn on the other side then they dress their shield and begin to couch their spear many good knight so griflet be the first that met with a knight one ladinas and they meet so eagerly that all men have wonder and they so fight that their shield fell to piece and horse and man fell to the earth and both the french knight and the english knight lay so long that all men weened they have be dead when lucas the butler saw griflet so lie he horse him again anon and they two do marvellous deed of arm with many bachelor also sir kay come out of an ambush with five knight with him and they six smite other six down but sir kay do that day marvellous deed of arm that there be none do so well a he that day then there come ladinas and gracian two knight of france and do pass well that all men praise them then come there sir placidas a good knight and meet with sir kay and smite him down horse and man where fore sir griflet be wroth and meet with sir placidas so hard that horse and man fell to the earth but when the five knight wist that sir kay have a fall they be wroth out of wit and therewith each of them five bare down a knight when king arthur and the two king saw them begin to wax wroth on both party they leap on small hackney and let cry that all men should depart unto their lodging and so they go home and unarm them and so to evensong and supper and after the three king go into a garden and give the prize unto sir kay and to lucas the butler and unto sir griflet and then they go unto council and with them gwenbaus the brother unto sir ban and bors a wise clerk and thither go ulfius and brastias and merlin and after they have be in council they go unto bed and on the morn they hear mass and to dinner and so to their council and make many argument what be best to do at the last they be conclude that merlin should go with a token of king ban and that be a ring unto hi men and king bors and gracian and placidas should go again and keep their castle and their country a for dread of king claudas king ban of benwick and king bors of gaul have ordain them and so pass the sea and come to benwick and when the people saw king ban ring and gracian and placidas they be glad and ask how the king fare and make great joy of their welfare and cording and accord unto the sovereign lord desire the men of war make them ready in all haste possible so that they be fifteen thousand on horse and foot and they have great plenty of victual with them by merlin provision but gracian and placidas be leave to furnish and garnish the castle for dread of king claudas right so merlin pass the sea well victual both by water and by land and when he come to the sea he send home the footman again and take no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback the most part men of arm and so shipped and pass the sea into england and land at dover and through the wit of merlin he have the host northward the privy way that could be think unto the forest of bedegraine and there in a valley he lodge them secretly then ride merlin unto arthur and the two king and tell them how he have speed whereof they have great marvel that man on earth might speed so soon and go and come so merlin tell them ten thousand be in the forest of bedegraine well arm at all point then be there no more to say but to horseback go all the host a arthur have afore purvey so with twenty thousand he pass by night and day but there be make such an ordinance afore by merlin that there

for he be a passing good knight of a king and but a young man chapter xvi yet more of the same battle by then come into the field king ban as fierce a a lion with band of green and thereupon gold ha a say king lot we must be discomfit for yonder i see the most valiant knight of the world and the man of the most renown for such two brother a be king ban and king bors be not live wherefore we must need void or die and but if we avoid manly and wisely there be but death when king ban come into the battle he come in so fiercely that the stroke redound again from the wood and the water wherefore king lot wept for pity and dole that he saw so many good knight take their end but through the great force of king ban they make both the northern battle that be depart hurtle together for great dread and the three king and their knight slew on ever that it be pity on to behold that multitude of the people that flee but king lot and king of the hundred knight and king morganore gather the people together pass knightly and do great prowess of arm and hold the battle all that day like hard when the king of the hundred knight behold the great damage that king ban do he thrust unto him with hi horse and smite him on high upon the helm a great stroke and astonied him sore then king ban be wroth with him and follow on him fiercely the other saw that and cast up hi shield and spur hi horse forward but the stroke of king ban fell down and carve a cantel off the shield and the sword slide down by the hauberk behind hi back and cut through the trapping of steel and the horse even in two piece that the sword felt the earth then the king of the hundred knight void the horse lightly and with hi sword he broach the horse of king ban through and through with that king ban void lightly from the dead horse and then king ban smote at the other so eagerly and smite him on the helm that he fell to the earth also in that ire he fell king morganore and there be great slaughter of good knight and much people by then come into the press king arthur and find king ban stand among dead men and dead horse fight on foot a a wood lion that there come none nigh him as far a he might reach with hi sword but he catch a grievous buffet whereof king arthur have great pity and arthur be so bloody that by hi shield there might no man know him for all be blood and brain on hi sword and a arthur look by him he saw a knight that be passingly well horse and therewith sir arthur run to him and smite him on the helm that hi sword go unto hi teeth and the knight sink down to the earth dead and anon arthur take the horse by the rein and lead him unto king ban and say fair brother have this horse for he have great myster thereof and me repenteth sore of your great damage it shall be soon revenge say king ban for i trust in god mine ure be not such but some of them may sore repent this i will well say arthur for i see your deed full actual nevertheless i might not come at you at that time but when king ban be mount on horseback then there begin new battle the which be sore and hard and pass great slaughter and so through great force king arthur king ban and king bors make their knight a little to withdraw them but alway the eleven king with their chivalry never turn back and so withdraw them to a little wood and so over a little river and there they rest them for on the night they might have no rest on the field and then the eleven king and knight put them on a heap all together a men adread and out of all comfort but there be no man might pass them they hold them so hard together both behind and before that king arthur have marvel of their deed of arm and be pass wroth ah sir arthur say king ban and king bors blame them not for they do as good men ought to do for by my faith say king ban they be the best fight men and knight of most prowess that ever i saw or heard speak of and those eleven king be men of great worship and if they be long unto you there be no king under the heaven have such eleven knight and of such worship i may not love them say arthur they would destroy me that wot we well say king ban and king bors for they be your mortal enemy and that hath be prove aforehand and this day they have do their part and that be great pity of their wilfulness then all the eleven king draw them together and then say king lot lord ye must other way than ye do or els the great loss be behind ye may see what people we have lose and what good men we lose because we wait always on these footman and ever in save of one of the footman we lose ten horseman for him therefore this be mine advice let u put our footman from u for it be near night for the noble arthur will not tarry on the footman for they may save themselves the wood be near hand and when we horsemen be together look every each of you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death and who that seeth any man dress him to flee lightly that he be slay for it be well that we slay a coward than through a coward all we to be slain how say ye say king lot answer me all ye king it be well say quoth king nentres so say the king of the hundred knight the same say the king carados and king uriens so do king idres and king brandegoris and so do king cradelment and the duke of cambenet the same say king clariance and king agwisance and sware they would never fail other neither for life nor for death and whoso that flee but do a they do should be slay then they amend their harness and right their shield and take new spear and set them on their thigh and stood still a it have be a plump of wood chapter xvii yet more of the same battle and how it be end by merlin when sir arthur and king ban and bors behold them and all their knight they praise them much for their noble cheer of chivalry for the hardy fighter that ever they hear or saw with that there dress them a forty noble knight and say unto the three king they would break their battle these be their

these knight rode on afore with spear on their thigh and spur their horse mightily a the horse might run and the eleven king with part of their knight rush with their horse a fast a they might with their spear and there they do on both party marvellous deed of arm so come into the thick of the press arthur ban and bors and slew down right on both hand that their horse go in blood up to the fetlock but ever the eleven king and their host be ever in the visage of arthur wherefore ban and bors have great marvel consider the great slaughter that there be but at the last they be drive aback over a little river with that come merlin on a great black horse and say unto arthur thou hast never do hast thou not do enough of three score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand and it be time to say ho for god be wroth with thee that thou wilt never have do for yonder eleven king at this time will not be overthrow but an thou tarry on them any longer thy fortune will turn and they shall increase and therefore withdraw you unto your lodging and rest you as soon a ye may and reward your good knight with gold and with silver for they have well deserve it there may no rich be too dear for them for of so few men a ye have there be never men do more of prowess than they have do today for ye have match this day with the best fighter of the world that be truth

must be a passing good man of hi hand and of hi deed and without villainy or treachery and without treason and if i may find such a knight that hath all these virtue he may draw out this sword out of the sheath for i have be at king riences it be tell me there be pass good knight and he and all hi knight have assay it and none can speed this be a great marvel say arthur if this be sooth i will myself assay to draw out the sword not presume upon myself that i be the best knight but that i will begin to draw at your sword in give example to all the baron that they shall assay everych one after other when i have assay it then arthur take the sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pull at it eagerly but the sword would not out sir say the damosel you need not to pull half so hard for he that shall pull it out shall do it with little might ye say well say arthur now assay ye all my baron but beware ye be not defile with shame treachery nor guile then it will not avail say the damosel for he must be a clean knight without villainy and of a gentle strain of father side and mother side most of all the baron of the round table that be there at that time assay all by row but there might none speed wherefore the damosel make great sorrow out of measure and say ala i weened in this court have be the best knight without treachery or treason by my faith say arthur here be

grace hap him a any knight that there be and a the damosel take her leave of arthur and of all the baron so depart this knight balin call unto her and say damosel i pray you of your courtesy suffer me as well to assay a these lord though that i be so poorly clothe in my heart meseemeth i be fully assure a some of these other and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well the damosel behold the poor knight and saw he be a likely man but for hi poor array she think he should be of no worship without villainy or treachery and then she say unto the knight sir it needeth not to put me to more pain or labour for it seemeth not you to speed there a other have fail ah fair damosel say balin worthiness and good tatches and good deed be not only in array but manhood and worship be hide within man person and many a worshipful knight be not know unto all people and therefore worship and hardiness be not in array by god say the damosel ye say sooth therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may then balin take the sword by the girdle and sheath and draw it out easily and when he look on the sword it please him much then have the king and all the baron great marvel that balin have do that adventure and many knight have great despite of balin cert say the damosel this be a passing good knight and the best that ever i find and most of worship without treason treachery or villainy and

for mine for i be pass heavy for your sake for ye will not believe that sword shall be your destruction and that be great pity with that the damosel depart make great sorrow anon after balin send for hi horse and armour and so would depart from the court and take hi leave of king arthur nay say the king i suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship i suppose ye be displease that i

knight arm on great horse and the damosel go to and fro by a tree and then be sir gawain ware how there hang a white shield on that tree and ever a the damosel come by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon the shield chapter xvii how sir gawain and sir uwaine meet with twelve fair damosel and how they complain on sir marhaus then sir gawain and sir uwaine go and salute them and ask why they do that despite to the shield sir say the damosel we shall tell you there be a knight in this country that owneth this white shield and he be a passing good man of hi hand but he hateth all lady and gentlewoman and therefore we do all this despite to the shield i shall say you say sir gawain it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all lady and gentlewoman and peradventure though he hate you he hath some certain cause and peradventure he loveth in some other place lady and gentlewoman and to be love again an he be such a man of prowess a ye speak of now what be hi name sir say they hi name be marhaus the king son of ireland i know him well say sir uwaine he be a passing good knight a any be alive for i saw him once prove at a joust where many knight be gather and that time there might no man withstand him ah say sir gawain damosel methinketh ye be to blame for it be to suppose he that hang that shield there he will not be long therefrom and then may those knight match him on horseback and that be more your worship than thus for i will abide no long to see a knight shield dishonoured and therewith sir uwaine and gawain depart a little from them and then be they ware where sir marhaus come rid on a great horse straight toward them and when the twelve damosel saw sir marhaus they flee into the turret a they be wild so that some of them fell by the way then the one of the knight of the tower dress hi shield and say on high sir marhaus defend thee and so they run together that the knight brake hi spear on marhaus and marhaus smite him so hard that he brake hi neck and the horse back that saw the other knight of the turret and dress him toward marhaus and they meet so eagerly together that the knight of the turret be soon smitten down horse and man stark dead chapter xviii how sir marhaus joust with sir gawain and sir uwaine and overthrow them both and then sir marhaus ride unto hi shield and saw how it be defouled and say of this despite i be a part avenge but for her love that give me this white shield i shall wear thee and hang mine where thou wast and so he hang it about hi neck then he ride straight unto sir gawain and to sir uwaine and ask them what they do there they answer him that they come from king arthur court to see adventure well say sir marhaus here be i ready an adventurous knight that will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire and so depart from them to fetch hi range let him go say sir uwaine unto sir gawain for he be a passing good knight a any be living i would not by my will that any of u be match with him nay say sir gawain not so it be shame to u be he not assay be he never so good a knight well say sir uwaine i will assay him afore you for i be more weak than ye and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me so these two knight come together with great raundon that sir uwaine smote sir marhaus that hi spear brast in piece on the shield and sir marhaus smite him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth and hurt sir uwaine on the left side then sir marhaus turn hi horse and rode toward gawain with hi spear and when sir gawain saw that he dress hi shield and they aventred their spear and they come together with all the might of their horse that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their shield but sir gawain spear brake but sir marhaus spear hold and therewith sir gawain and hi horse rush down to the earth and lightly sir gawain rise on hi foot and pull out hi sword and dress him toward sir marhaus on foot and sir marhaus saw that and pull out hi sword and begin to come to sir gawain on horseback sir knight say sir gawain alight on foot or els i will slay thy horse gramercy say sir marhaus of your gentleness ye teach me courtesy for it be not for one knight to be on foot and the other on horseback and therewith sir marhaus set hi spear against a tree and alight and tie hi horse to a tree and dress hi shield and either come unto other eagerly and smite together with their sword that their shield fly in cantels and they bruise their helm and their hauberk and wound either other but sir gawain from it pass nine of the clock wax ever strong and strong for then it come to the hour of noon and thrice hi might be increase all this espy sir marhaus and have great wonder how hi might increase and so they wound other pass sore and then when it be past noon and when it draw toward evensong sir gawain strength feebled and wax pass faint that unnethes he might dure any long and sir marhaus be then big and big sir knight say sir marhaus i have well felt that ye be a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might a ever i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrel be not great and therefore it be pity to do you hurt for i feel ye be pass feeble ah say sir gawain gentle knight ye say the word that i should say and therewith they take off their helm and either kiss other and there they swear together either to love other a brother and sir marhaus pray sir gawain to lodge with him that night and so they take their horse and ride toward sir marhaus house and a they ride by the way sir knight say sir gawain i have marvel that so valiant a man a ye be love no lady nor damosel sir say sir marhaus they name me wrongfully those that give me that name but well i wot it be the damosel of the turret that so name me and other such a they be now shall i tell you for what cause i hate them for they be sorceress and enchanter many of them and be a knight never so good of hi body and full of prowess a man may be they will make him a stark coward to have the good of him and this be the principal cause that i hate them and to all good lady and gentlewoman i owe my service a a knight ought to do a the book rehearseth in french there be many knight that overmatched sir gawain for all the thrice might that he have sir launcelot de lake sir tristram sir bors de ganis sir percivale sir pelleas and sir marhaus these six knight have the good of sir gawain then within a little while they come to sir marhaus place which be in a little priory and there they alight and lady and damosel unarm them and hastily look to their hurt for they be all three hurt and so they have all three good lodge with sir marhaus and good cheer for when he wist that they be king arthur sister son he make them all the cheer that lay in hi power and so they sojourn there a sennight and be well ease of their wound and at the last departed now say sir marhaus we will not depart so lightly for i will bring you through the forest and rode day by day well a seven day or they find any adventure at the last they come into a great forest that be name the country and forest of arroy and the country of strange adventure in this country say sir marhaus come never knight since it be christen but he find strange adventure and so they ride and come into a deep valley full of stone and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby be the head of the stream a fair fountain and three damosel sit thereby and then they ride to them and either salute other and the eldest have a garland of gold about her head and she be three score winter of age or more and her hair be white under the garland the second damosel be of thirty winter of age with a circlet of gold about her head the third damosel be but fifteen year of age and a garland of flower about her head when these knight have so behold them they ask them the cause why they sit at that fountain we be here say the damosel for this cause if we may see any errant knight to teach them unto strange adventure and ye be three knight that seek adventure and we be three damosel and therefore each one of you must choose one of u and when ye have do so we will lead you unto three highway and there each of you shall choose a way and hi damosel with him and this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again and god send you your life and thereto ye must plight your troth this be well say say sir marhaus chapter xix how sir marhaus sir gawain and sir uwaine meet three damosel and each of them take one1 1 misnumbered xx by caxton now shall everych of u choose a damosel i shall tell you say sir uwaine i be the young and most weak of you both therefore i will have the eldest damosel for she hath see much and can best help me when i have need for i have most need of help of you both now say sir marhaus i will have the damosel of thirty winter age for she falleth best to me well say sir gawain i thank you for ye have leave me the young and the fairest and she be most liefest to me then every damosel take her knight by the rein of hi bridle and bring him to the three way and there be their oath make to meet at the fountain that day twelvemonth an they be live and so they kiss and depart and each knight set hi lady behind him and sir uwaine take the way that lay west and sir marhaus take the way that lay south and sir gawain take the way that lay north now will we begin at sir gawain that hold that way till that he come unto a fair manor where dwell an old knight and a good householder and there sir gawain ask the knight if he know any adventure in that country i shall show you some tomorn say the old knight and that marvellous so on the morn they ride into the forest of adventure to a laund and thereby they find a cross and a they stand and hove there come by them the fair knight and the seemly man that ever they saw make the great dole that ever man make and then he be ware of sir gawain and salute him and pray god to send him much worship a to that say sir gawain gramercy also i pray to god that he send you honour and worship ah say the knight i may lay that aside for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship chapter xx how a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady and therewith he pass unto the one side of the laund and on the other side saw sir gawain ten knight that hove still and make them ready with their shield and spear against that one knight that come by sir gawain then this one knight aventred a great spear and one of the ten knight encounter with him but this woful knight smote him so hard that he fell over hi horse tail so this same dolorous knight serve them all that at the leastway he smite down horse and man and all he do with one spear and so when they be all ten on foot they go to that one knight and he stand stone still and suffer them to pull him down off hi horse and bound him hand and foot and tie him under the horse belly and so lead him with them o jesu say sir gawain this be a doleful sight to see the yonder knight so to be entreat and it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so for he maketh no resistance no say hi host that be truth for an he would they all be too weak so to do him sir say the damosel unto sir gawain meseemeth it be your worship to help that dolorous knight for methinketh he be one of the best knight that ever i saw i would do for him say sir gawain but it seemeth he will have no help then say the damosel methinketh ye have no lust to help him thus a they talk they saw a knight on the other side of the laund all arm save the head and on the other side there come a dwarf on horseback all arm save the head with a great mouth and a short nose and when the dwarf come nigh he say where be the lady should meet u here and therewithal she come forth out of the wood and then they begin to strive for the lady for the knight say he would have her and the dwarf say he would have her will we do well say the dwarf yonder be a knight at the cross let u put it both upon him and a he deemeth so shall it be i will well say the knight and so they go all three unto sir gawain and tell him wherefore they strive well sir say he will ye put the matter in my hand yea they say both now damosel say sir gawain ye shall stand betwixt them both and whether ye list well to go to he shall have you and when she be set between them both she leave the knight and go to the dwarf and the dwarf take her and go hi way singing and the knight go hi way with great mourn then come there two knight all arm and cry on high sir gawain knight of king arthur make thee ready in all haste and joust with me so they run together that either fell down and then on foot they draw their sword and do full actually the meanwhile the other knight go to the damosel and ask her why she abide with that knight and if ye would abide with me i will be your faithful knight and with you will i be say the damosel for with sir gawain i may not find in mine heart to be with him for now here be one knight discomfit ten knight and at the last he be cowardly lead away and therefore let u two go whilst they fight and sir gawain fought with that other knight long but at the last they accord both and then the knight pray sir gawain to lodge with him that night so a sir gawain go with this knight he ask him what knight be he in this country that smite down the ten knight for when he have do so manfully he suffer them to bind him hand and foot and so lead him away ah say the knight that be the best knight i trow in the world and the most man of prowess and he hath be serve so a he be even more than ten time and hi name hight sir pelleas and he loveth a great lady in this country and her name be ettard and so when he love her there be cry in this country a great joust three day and all the knight of this country be there and gentlewoman and who that prove him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a circlet of gold and the circlet the knight should give it to the fair lady that be at the joust and this knight sir pelleas be the best knight that be there and there be five hundred knight but there be never man that ever sir pelleas meet withal but he strike him down or els from hi horse and every day of three day he strike down twenty knight therefore they give him the prize and forthwith he go thereas the lady ettard be and give her the circlet and say openly she be the fair lady that there be and that would he prove upon any knight that would say nay chapter xxi how king pelleas suffer himself to be take prisoner because he would have a sight of hi lady and how sir gawain promisehim to get to him the love of hi lady and so he choose her for hi sovereign lady and never to love other but her but she be so proud that she have scorn of him and say that she would never love him though he would die for her wherefore all lady and gentlewoman have scorn of her that she be so proud for there be fair than she and there be none that be there but an sir pelleas would have proffer them love they would have love him for hi noble prowess and so this knight promisethe lady ettard to follow her into this country and never to leave her till she love him and thus he be here the most part nigh her and lodge by a priory and every week she sendeth knight to fight with him and when he hath put them to the bad then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner because he would have a sight of this lady and always she doth him great despite for sometime she maketh her knight to tie him to hi horse tail and some to bind him under the horse belly thus in the most shamefullest way that she can think he be bring to her and all she doth it for to cause him to leave this country and to leave hi love but all this can not make him to leave for an he would have fight on foot he might have have the good of the ten knight as well on foot a on horseback ala say sir gawain it be great pity of him and after this night i will seek him tomorrow in this forest to do him all the help i can so on the morn sir gawain take hi leave of hi host sir carados and ride into the forest and at the last he meet with sir pelleas make great moan out of measure so each of them salute other and ask him why he make such sorrow and a it be above rehearse sir pelleas tell sir gawain but always i suffer her knight to fare so with me a ye saw yesterday in trust at the last to win her love for she knoweth well all her knight should not lightly win me an me list to fight with them to the uttermost wherefore an i love her not so sore i have liefer die an hundred time an i might die so oft rather than i would suffer that despite but i trust she will have pity upon me at the last for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to have hi entent but alas i be unfortunate and therewith he make so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on horseback now say sir gawain leave your mourning and i shall promise
