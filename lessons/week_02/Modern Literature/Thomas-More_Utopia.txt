henry viii the unconquered king of england a prince adorn with all the virtue that become a great monarch have some difference of no small consequence with charles the most serene prince of castile send me into flanders a hi ambassador for treat and compose matter between them i be colleague and companion to that incomparable man cuthbert tonstal whom the king with such universal applause lately make master of the roll but of whom i will say nothing not because i fear that the testimony of a friend will be suspect but rather because hi learning and virtue be too great for me to do them justice and so well know that they need not my commendation unless i would accord to the proverb show the sun with a lantern those that be appoint by the prince to treat with u meet u at bruges accord to agreement they be all worthy men the margrave of bruges be their head and the chief man among them but he that be esteem the wise and that speak for the rest be george temse the provost of casselsee both art and nature have concur to make him eloquent he be very learn in the law and a he have a great capacity so by a long practice in affair he be very dexterous at unravel them after we have several time meet without come to an agreement they go to brussels for some day to know the prince pleasure and since our business would admit it i go to antwerp while i be there among many that visit me there be one that be more acceptable to me than any other peter giles bear at antwerp who be a man of great honour and of a good rank in hi town though less than he deserve for i do not know if there be anywhere to be find a more learned and a good breed young man for a he be both a very worthy and a very knowing person so he be so civil to all men so particularly kind to hi friend and so full of candour and affection that there be not perhaps above one or two anywhere to be find that be in all respect so perfect a friend he be extraordinarily modest there be no artifice in him and yet no man have more of a prudent simplicity hi conversation be so pleasant and so innocently cheerful that hi company in a great measure lessen any longing to go back to my country and to my wife and child which an absence of four month have quicken very much one day a i be return home from mass at st mary which be the chief church and the most frequented of any in antwerp i saw him by accident talk with a stranger who seem past the flower of hi age hi face be tan he have a long beard and hi cloak be hang carelessly about him so that by hi look and habit i conclude he be a seaman as soon a peter saw me he come and salute me and a i be return hi civility he take me aside and point to him with whom he have be discourse he say do you see that man i be just think to bring him to you i answer he should have be very welcome on your account and on hi own too reply he if you know the man for there be none alive that can give so copious an account of unknown nation and country a he can do which i know you very much desire then say i i do not guess amiss for at first sight i take him for a seaman but you be much mistaken say he for he have not sail a a seaman but a a traveller or rather a philosopher this raphael who from hi family carry the name of hythloday be not ignorant of the latin tongue but be eminently learn in the greek have apply himself more particularly to that than to the former because he have give himself much to philosophy in which he know that the roman have leave u nothing that be valuable except what be to be find in seneca and cicero he be a portuguese by birth and be so desirous of see the world that he divide hi estate among hi brother run the same hazard a americus vesputius and bore a share in three of hi four voyage that be now publish only he do not return with him in hi last but obtain leave of him almost by force that he might be one of those twentyfour who be leave at the farthest place at which they touch in their last voyage to new castile the leave him thus do not a little gratify one that be more fond of travel than of return home to be bury in hi own country for he use often to say that the way to heaven be the same from all place and he that have no grave have the heaven still over him yet this disposition of mind have cost him dear if god have not be very gracious to him for after he with five castalians have travel over many country at last by strange good fortune he get to ceylon and from thence to calicut where he very happily find some portuguese ship and beyond all men expectation return to hi native country when peter have say this to me i thank him for hi kindness in intend to give me the acquaintance of a man whose conversation he know would be so acceptable and upon that raphael and i embrace each other after those civility be past which be usual with stranger upon their first meeting we all go to my house and enter into the garden sit down on a green bank and entertain one another in discourse he tell u that when vesputius have sail away he and hi companion that stay behind in new castile by degree insinuate themselves into the affection of the people of the country meeting often with them and treat them gently and at last they not only live among them without danger but converse familiarly with them and get so far into the heart of a prince whose name and country i have forget that he both furnish them plentifully with all thing necessary and also with the convenience of travel both boat when they go by water and waggon when they travel over land he send with them a very faithful guide who be to introduce and recommend them to such other prince a they have a mind to see and after many day journey they come to town and city and to commonwealth that be both happily govern and well people under the equator and a far on both side of it a the sun move there lay vast desert that be parch with the perpetual heat of the sun the soil be wither all thing look dismally and all place be either quite uninhabited or abound with wild beast and serpent and some few men that be neither less wild nor less cruel than the beast themselves but a they go far a new scene open all thing grow mild the air less burn the soil more verdant and even the beast be less wild and at last there be nation town and city that have not only mutual commerce among themselves and with their neighbour but trade both by sea and land to very remote country there they find the conveniencies of see many country on all hand for no ship go any voyage into which he and hi companion be not very welcome the first vessel that they saw be flatbottomed their sail be make of reed and wicker woven close together only some be of leather but afterwards they find ship make with round keel and canvas sail and in all respect like our ship and the seaman understand both astronomy and navigation he get wonderfully into their favour by show them the use of the needle of which till then they be utterly ignorant they sail before with great caution and only in summer time but now they count all season alike trust wholly to the loadstone in which they be perhaps more secure than safe so that there be reason to fear that this discovery which be think would prove so much to their advantage may by their imprudence become an occasion of much mischief to them but it be too long to dwell on all that he tell u he have observe in every place it would be too great a digression from our present purpose whatever be necessary to be tell concern those wise and prudent institution which he observe among civilised nation may perhaps be relate by u on a more proper occasion we ask him many question concern all these thing to which he answer very willingly we make no inquiry after monster than which nothing be more common for everywhere one may hear of ravenous dog and wolf and cruel meneaters but it be not so easy to find state that be well and wisely govern a he tell u of many thing that be amiss in those newdiscovered country so he reckon up not a few thing from which pattern might be take for correct the error of these nation among whom we live of which an account may be give a i have already promise at some other time for at present i intend only to relate those particular that he tell u of the manner and law of the utopian but i will begin with the occasion that lead u to speak of that commonwealth after raphael have discourse with great judgment on the many error that be both among u and these nation have treat of the wise institution both here and there and have speak a distinctly of the custom and governmentof every nation through which he have past a if he have spend hi whole life in it peter be strike with admiration say i wonder raphael how it come that you enter into no king service for i be sure there be none to whom you would not be very acceptable for your learning and knowledge both of men and thing be such that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly but be of great use to them by the example you could set before them and the advice you could give them and by this mean you would both serve your own interest and be of great use to all your friend a for my friend answer he i need not be much concerned have already do for them all that be incumbent on me for when i be not only in good health but fresh and young i distribute that among my kindred and friend which other people do not part with till they be old and sick when they then unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves i think my friend ought to rest content with this and not to expect that for their sake i should enslave myself to any king whatsoever soft and fair say peter i do not mean that you should be a slave to any king but only that you should assist them and be useful to them the change of the word say he do not alter the matter but term it a you will reply peter i do not see any other way in which you can be so useful both in private to your friend and to the public and by which you can make your own condition happier happier answer raphael be that to be compass in a way so abhorrent to my genius now i live a i will to which i believe few courtier can pretend and there be so many that court the favour of great men that there will be no great loss if they be not troubled either with me or with other of my temper upon this say i i perceive raphael that you neither desire wealth nor greatness and indeed i value and admire such a man much more than i do any of the great men in the world yet i think you would do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul a yours be if you would apply your time and thought to public affair even though you may happen to find it a little uneasy to yourself and this you can never do with so much advantage a by be take into the council of some great prince and put him on noble and worthy action which i know you would do if you be in such a post for the spring both of good and evil flow from the prince over a whole nation a from a lasting fountain so much learning a you have even without practice in affair or so great a practice a you have have without any other learning would render you a very fit counsellor to any king whatsoever you be doubly mistake say he mr more both in your opinion of me and in the judgment you make of thing for a i have not that capacity that you fancy i have so if i have it the public would not be one jot the good when i have sacrifice my quiet to it for most prince apply themselves more to affair of war than to the useful art of peace and in these i neither have any knowledge nor do i much desire it they be generally more set on acquire new kingdom right or wrong than on govern well those they possess and among the minister of prince there be none that be not so wise a to need no assistance or at least that do not think themselves so wise that they imagine they need none and if they court any it be only those for whom the prince have much personal favour whom by their fawning and flattery they endeavour to fix to their own interest and indeed nature have so make u that we all love to be flatter and to please ourselves with our own notion the old crow love hi young and the ape her cub now if in such a court make up of person who envy all other and only admire themselves a person should but propose anything that he have either read in history or observe in hi travel the rest would think that the reputation of their wisdom would sink and that their interest would be much depress if they could not run it down and if all other thing fail then they would fly to this that such or such thing please our ancestor and it be well for u if we could but match them they would set up their rest on such an answer a a sufficient confutation of all that could be say a if it be a great misfortune that any should be find wise than hi ancestor but though they willingly let go all the good thing that be among those of former age yet if good thing be propose they cover themselves obstinately with this excuse of reverence to past time i have meet with these proud morose and absurd judgment of thing in many place particularly once in england were you ever there say i yes i be answer he and stay some month there not long after the rebellion in the west be suppress with a great slaughter of the poor people that be engage in it i be then much oblige to that reverend prelate john morton archbishop of canterbury cardinal and chancellor of england a man say he peter for mr more know well what he be that be not less venerable for hi wisdom and virtue than for the high character he bore he be of a middle stature not break with age hi look begot reverence rather than fear hi conversation be easy but serious and grave he sometimes take pleasure to try the force of those that come a suitor to him upon business by speak sharply though decently to them and by that he discover their spirit and presence of mind with which he be much delight when it do not grow up to impudence a bear a great resemblance to hi own temper and he look on such person a the fit men for affair he speak both gracefully and weightily he be eminently skilled in the law have a vast understanding and a prodigious memory and those excellent talent with which nature have furnish him be improve by study and experience when i be in england the king depend much on hi counsel and the governmentseem to be chiefly support by him for from hi youth he have be all along practise in affair and have pass through many traverse of fortune he have with great cost acquire a vast stock of wisdom which be not soon lose when it be purchase so dear one day when i be din with him there happen to be at table one of the english lawyer who take occasion to run out in a high commendation of the severe execution of justice upon thief who a he say be then hang so fast that there be sometimes twenty on one gibbet and upon that he say he could not wonder enough how it come to pass that since so few escaped there be yet so many thief leave who be still rob in all place upon this i who take the boldness to speak freely before the cardinal say there be no reason to wonder at the matter since this way of punish thief be neither just in itself nor good for the public for a the severity be too great so the remedy be not effectual simple theft not be so great a crime that it ought to cost a man hi life no punishment how severe soever be able to restrain those from rob who can find out no other way of livelihood in this say i not only you in england but a great part of the world imitate some ill master that be ready to chastise their scholar than to teach them there be dreadful punishment enact against thief but it be much good to make such good provision by which every man might be put in a method how to live and so be preserve from the fatal necessity of steal and of die for it there have be care enough take for that say he there be many handicraft and there be husbandry by which they may make a shift to live unless they have a great mind to follow ill course that will not serve your turn say i for many lose their limb in civil or foreign war a lately in the cornish rebellion and some time ago in your war with france who be thus mutilate in the service of their king and country can no more follow their old trade and be too old to learn new one but since war be only accidental thing and have interval let u consider those thing that fall out every day there be a great number of nobleman among you that be themselves as idle a drone that subsist on other men labour on the labour of their tenant whom to raise their revenue they pare to the quick this indeed be the only instance of their frugality for in all other thing they be prodigal even to the beggaring of themselves but besides this they carry about with them a great number of idle fellow who never learn any art by which they may gain their living and these as soon a either their lord die or they themselves fall sick be turn out of door for your lord be ready to fee idle people than to take care of the sick and often the heir be not able to keep together so great a family a hi predecessor do now when the stomach of those that be thus turn out of door grow keen they rob no less keenly and what els can they do for when by wander about they have wear out both their health and their clothes and be tattered and look ghastly men of quality will not entertain them and poor men dare not do it know that one who have be breed up in idleness and pleasure and who be use to walk about with hi sword and buckler despise all the neighbourhood with an insolent scorn a far below him be not fit for the spade and mattock nor will he serve a poor man for so small a hire and in so low a diet a he can afford to give him to this he answer this sort of men ought to be particularly cherish for in them consist the force of the army for which we have occasion since their birth inspire them with a noble sense of honour than be to be find among tradesman or plowman you may as well say reply i that you must cherish thief on the account of war for you will never want the one as long a you have the other and a robber prove sometimes gallant soldier so soldier often prove brave robber so near an alliance there be between those two sort of life but this bad custom so common among you of keep many servant be not peculiar to this nation in france there be yet a more pestiferous sort of people for the whole country be full of soldier still keep up in time of peace if such a state of a nation can be call a peace and these be keep in pay upon the same account that you plead for those idle retainer about nobleman this be a maxim of those pretended statesman that it be necessary for the public safety to have a good body of veteran soldier ever in readiness they think raw men be not to be depend on and they sometimes seek occasion for make war that they may train up their soldier in the art of cut throat or a sallust observe for keep their hand in use that they may not grow dull by too long an intermission but france have learn to it cost how dangerous it be to fee such beast the fate of the roman carthaginian and syrian and many other nation and city which be both overturn and quite ruin by those stand army should make other wise and the folly of this maxim of the french appear plainly even from this that their trained soldier often find your raw men prove too hard for them of which i will not say much l you may think i flatter the english every day experience show that the mechanic in the town or the clown in the country be not afraid of fight with those idle gentleman if they be not disable by some misfortune in their body or dispirit by extreme want so that you need not fear that those wellshaped and strong men for it be only such that nobleman love to keep about them till they spoil them who now grow feeble with ease and be soften with their effeminate manner of life would be less fit for action if they be well breed and well employ and it seem very unreasonable that for the prospect of a war which you need never have but when you please you should maintain so many idle men a will always disturb you in time of peace which be ever to be more consider than war but i do not think that this necessity of steal arises only from hence there be another cause of it more peculiar to england what be that say the cardinal the increase of pasture say i by which your sheep which be naturally mild and easily keep in order may be say now to devour men and unpeople not only villages but town for wherever it be find that the sheep of any soil yield a soft and rich wool than ordinary there the nobility and gentry and even those holy men the abbot not content with the old rent which their farm yield nor think it enough that they live at their ease do no good to the public resolve to do it hurt instead of good they stop the course of agriculture destroy house and town reserve only the church and enclose ground that they may lodge their sheep in them a if forest and park have swallow up too little of the land those worthy countryman turn the best inhabited place into solitude for when an insatiable wretch who be a plague to hi country resolve to enclose many thousand acre of ground the owner as well a tenant be turn out of their possession by trick or by main force or be weary out by ill usage they be force to sell them by which mean those miserable people both men and woman marry and unmarried old and young with their poor but numerous family since country business require many hand be all force to change their seat not know whither to go and they must sell almost for nothing their household stuff which could not bring them much money even though they might stay for a buyer when that little money be at an end for it will be soon spent what be leave for them to do but either to steal and so to be hang god know how justly or to go about and beg and if they do this they be put in prison a idle vagabond while they would willingly work but can find none that will hire them for there be no more occasion for country labour to which they have be breed when there be no arable ground leave one shepherd can look after a flock which will stock an extent of ground that would require many hand if it be to be plough and reap this likewise in many place raise the price of corn the price of wool be also so rise that the poor people who be wont to make cloth be no more able to buy it and this likewise make many of them idle for since the increase of pasture god have punish the avarice of the owner by a rot among the sheep which have destroy vast number of them to u it might have seem more just have it fell on the owner themselves but suppose the sheep should increase ever so much their price be not likely to fall since though they can not be call a monopoly because they be not engross by one person yet they be in so few hand and these be so rich that a they be not press to sell them sooner than they have a mind to it so they never do it till they have raise the price as high a possible and on the same account it be that the other kind of cattle be so dear because many village be pull down and all country labour be much neglect there be none who make it their business to breed them the rich do not breed cattle a they do sheep but buy them lean and at low price and after they have fatten them on their ground sell them again at high rate and i do not think that all the inconvenience this will produce be yet observe for a they sell the cattle dear so if they be consume faster than the breeding country from which they be bring can afford them then the stock must decrease and this must need end in great scarcity and by these mean this your island which seem a to this particular the happy in the world will suffer much by the cursed avarice of a few person besides this the rising of corn make all people lessen their family as much a they can and what can those who be dismiss by them do but either beg or rob and to this last a man of a great mind be much sooner drawn than to the former luxury likewise break in apace upon you to set forward your poverty and misery there be an excessive vanity in apparel and great cost in diet and that not only in noblemens family but even among tradesman among the farmer themselves and among all rank of person you have also many infamous house and besides those that be know the tavern and alehouse be no good add to these dice card table football tennis and quoit in which money run fast away and those that be initiate into them must in the conclusion betake themselves to rob for a supply banish these plague and give order that those who have dispeopled so much soil may either rebuild the village they have pull down or let out their ground to such a will do it restrain those engrossings of the rich that be a bad almost a monopoly leave few occasion to idleness let agriculture be set up again and the manufacture of the wool be regulate that so there may be work find for those company of idle people whom want force to be thief or who now be idle vagabond or useless servant will certainly grow thief at last if you do not find a remedy to these evil it be a vain thing to boast of your severity in punish theft which though it may have the appearance of justice yet in itself be neither just nor convenient for if you suffer your people to be illeducated and their manner to be corrupt from their infancy and then punish them for those crime to which their first education dispose them what els be to be conclude from this but that you first make thief and then punish them while i be talk thus the counsellor who be present have prepare an answer and have resolve to resume all i have say accord to the formality of a debate in which thing be generally repeat more faithfully than they be answer a if the chief trial to be make be of men memory you have talk prettily for a stranger say he have hear of many thing among u which you have not be able to consider well but i will make the whole matter plain to you and will first repeat in order all that you have say then i will show how much your ignorance of our affair have mislead you and will in the last place answer all your argument and that i may begin where i promise there be four thing hold your peace say the cardinal this will take up too much time therefore we will at present ease you of the trouble of answer and reserve it to our next meeting which shall be tomorrow if raphael affair and yours can admit of it but raphael say he to me i would gladly know upon what reason it be that you think theft ought not to be punish by death would you give way to it or do you propose any other punishment that will be more useful to the public for since death do not restrain theft if men think their life would be safe what fear or force could restrain ill men on the contrary they would look on the mitigation of the punishment a an invitation to commit more crime i answer it seem to me a very unjust thing to take away a mans life for a little money for nothing in the world can be of equal value with a man life and if it be say that it be not for the money that one suffers but for hi break the law i must say extreme justice be an extreme injury for we ought not to approve of those terrible law that make the small offence capital nor of that opinion of the stoic that make all crime equal a if there be no difference to be make between the kill a man and the take hi purse between which if we examine thing impartially there be no likeness nor proportion god have command u not to kill and shall we kill so easily for a little money but if one shall say that by that law we be only forbid to kill any except when the law of the land allow of it upon the same ground law may be make in some case to allow of adultery and perjury for god have take from u the right of dispose either of our own or of other people live if it be pretend that the mutual consent of men in make law can authorise manslaughter in case in which god have give u no example that it free people from the obligation of the divine law and so make murder a lawful action what be this but to give a preference to human law before the divine and if this be once admit by the same rule men may in all other thing put what restriction they please upon the law of god if by the mosaic law though it be rough and severe a be a yoke laid on an obstinate and servile nation men be only fin and not put to death for theft we can not imagine that in this new law of mercy in which god treat u with the tenderness of a father he have give u a great licence to cruelty than he do to the jew upon these reason it be that i think put thief to death be not lawful and it be plain and obvious that it be absurd and of ill consequence to the commonwealth that a thief and a murderer should be equally punish for if a robber see that hi danger be the same if he be convict of theft a if he be guilty of murder this will naturally incite him to kill the person whom otherwise he would only have rob since if the punishment be the same there be more security and less danger of discovery when he that can best make it be put out of the way so that terrify thief too much provokes them to cruelty but a to the question what more convenient way of punishment can be find i think it much easy to find out that than to invent anything that be bad why should we doubt but the way that be so long in use among the old roman who understand so well the art of governmentbe very proper for their punishment they condemn such a they find guilty of great crime to work their whole life in quarry or to dig in mine with chain about them but the method that i like best be that which i observe in my travel in persia among the polylerits who be a considerable and wellgoverned people they pay a yearly tribute to the king of persia but in all other respect they be a free nation and govern by their own law they lie far from the sea and be environ with hill and be content with the production of their own country which be very fruitful they have little commerce with any other nation and a they accord to the genius of their country have no inclination to enlarge their border so their mountain and the pension they pay to the persian secure them from all invasion thus they have no war among them they live rather conveniently than with splendour and may be rather call a happy nation than either eminent or famous for i do not think that they be know so much a by name to any but their next neighbour those that be find guilty of theft among them be bind to make restitution to the owner and not a it be in other place to the prince for they reckon that the prince have no more right to the steal good than the thief but if that which be steal be no more in be then the good of the thief be estimate and restitution be make out of them the remainder be give to their wife and child and they themselves be condemn to serve in the public work but be neither imprisoned nor chained unless there happen to be some extraordinary circumstance in their crime they go about loose and free working for the public if they be idle or backward to work they be whip but if they work hard they be well use and treat without any mark of reproach only the list of them be call always at night and then they be shut up they suffer no other uneasiness but this of constant labour for a they work for the public so they be well entertain out of the public stock which be do differently in different place in some place whatever be bestow on them be raise by a charitable contribution and though this way may seem uncertain yet so merciful be the inclination of that people that they be plentifully supply by it but in other place public revenue be set aside for them or there be a constant tax or pollmoney raise for their maintenance in some place they be set to no public work but every private man that have occasion to hire workman go to the marketplace and hire them of the public a little low than he would do a freeman if they go lazily about their task he may quicken them with the whip by this mean there be always some piece of work or other to be do by them and besides their livelihood they earn somewhat still to the public they all wear a peculiar habit of one certain colour and their hair be crop a little above their ear and a piece of one of their ear be cut off their friend be allow to give them either meat drink or clothes so they be of their proper colour but it be death both to the giver and taker if they give them money nor be it less penal for any freeman to take money from them upon any account whatsoever and it be also death for any of these slave so they be call to handle arm those of every division of the country be distinguish by a peculiar mark which it be capital for them to lay aside to go out of their bound or to talk with a slave of another jurisdiction and the very attempt of an escape be no less penal than an escape itself it be death for any other slave to be accessory to it and if a freeman engage in it he be condemn to slavery those that discover it be reward if freeman in money and if slave with liberty together with a pardon for be accessory to it that so they might find their account rather in repent of their engaging in such a design than in persist in it these be their law and rule in relation to robbery and it be obvious that they be as advantageous a they be mild and gentle since vice be not only destroyed and men preserve but they be treat in such a manner a to make them see the necessity of be honest and of employ the rest of their life in repair the injury they have formerly do to society nor be there any hazard of their fall back to their old custom and so little do traveller apprehend mischief from them that they generally make use of them for guide from one jurisdiction to another for there be nothing leave them by which they can rob or be the good for it since a they be disarm so the very have of money be a sufficient conviction and a they be certainly punish if discover so they can not hope to escape for their habit be in all the part of it different from what be commonly worn they can not fly away unless they would go naked and even then their cropped ear would betray them the only danger to be fear from them be their conspiring against the governmentbut those of one division and neighbourhood can do nothing to any purpose unless a general conspiracy be lay amongst all the slave of the several jurisdiction which can not be do since they can not meet or talk together nor will any venture on a design where the concealment would be so dangerous and the discovery so profitable none be quite hopeless of recover their freedom since by their obedience and patience and by give good ground to believe that they will change their manner of life for the future they may expect at last to obtain their liberty and some be every year restore to it upon the good character that be give of them when i have relate all this i add that i do not see why such a method might not be follow with more advantage than could ever be expect from that severe justice which the counsellor magnify so much to this he answer that it could never take place in england without endanger the whole nation a he say this he shake hi head make some grimace and hold hi peace while all the company seem of hi opinion except the cardinal who say that it be not easy to form a judgment of it success since it be a method that never yet have be try but if say he when sentence of death be pass upon a thief the prince would reprieve him for a while and make the experiment upon him deny him the privilege of a sanctuary and then if it have a good effect upon him it might take place and if it do not succeed the bad would be to execute the sentence on the condemned person at last and i do not see add he why it would be either unjust inconvenient or at all dangerous to admit of such a delay in my opinion the vagabond ought to be treat in the same manner against whom though we have make many law yet we have not be able to gain our end when the cardinal have do they all commend the motion though they have despise it when it come from me but more particularly commend what relate to the vagabond because it be hi own observation i do not know whether it be worth while to tell what follow for it be very ridiculous but i shall venture at it for a it be not foreign to this matter so some good use may be make of it there be a jester standing by that counterfeit the fool so naturally that he seem to be really one the jest which he offer be so cold and dull that we laugh more at him than at them yet sometimes he say a it be by chance thing that be not unpleasant so a to justify the old proverb that he who throw the dice often will sometimes have a lucky hit when one of the company have say that i have take care of the thief and the cardinal have take care of the vagabond so that there remain nothing but that some public provision might be make for the poor whom sickness or old age have disable from labour leave that to me say the fool and i shall take care of them for there be no sort of people whose sight i abhor more have be so often vexed with them and with their sad complaint but a dolefully soever a they have tell their tale they could never prevail so far a to draw one penny from me for either i have no mind to give them anything or when i have a mind to do it i have nothing to give them and they now know me so well that they will not lose their labour but let me pass without give me any trouble because they hope for nothing no more in faith than if i be a priest but i would have a law make for send all these beggar to monasteries the men to the benedictine to be make laybrothers and the woman to be nun the cardinal smile and approve of it in jest but the rest like it in earnest there be a divine present who though he be a grave morose man yet he be so pleased with this reflection that be make on the priest and the monk that he begin to play with the fool and say to him this will not deliver you from all beggar except you take care of u friar that be do already answer the fool for the cardinal have provide for you by what he propose for restrain vagabond and set them to work for i know no vagabond like you this be well entertain by the whole company who look at the cardinal perceive that he be not illpleased at it only the friar himself be vex a may be easily imagine and fell into such a passion that he could not forbear rail at the fool and call him knave slanderer backbiter and son of perdition and then cite some dreadful threatenings out of the scripture against him now the jester think he be in hi element and lay about him freely good friar say he be not angry for it be write in patience posse your soul the friar answer for i shall give you hi own word i be not angry you hangman at least i do not sin in it for the psalmist say be ye angry and sin not upon this the cardinal admonish him gently and wish him to govern hi passion no my lord say he i speak not but from a good zeal which i ought to have for holy men have have a good zeal a it be say the zeal of thy house hath eat me up and we sing in our church that those who mock elisha a he go up to the house of god felt the effect of hi zeal which that mocker that rogue that scoundrel will perhaps feel you do this perhaps with a good intention say the cardinal but in my opinion it be wiser in you and perhaps good for you not to engage in so ridiculous a contest with a fool no my lord answer he that be not wisely do for solomon the wise of men say answer a fool accord to hi folly which i now do and show him the ditch into which he will fall if he be not aware of it for if the many mocker of elisha who be but one bald man felt the effect of hi zeal what will become of the mocker of so many friar among whom there be so many bald men we have likewise a bull by which all that jeer u be excommunicate when the cardinal saw that there be no end of this matter he make a sign to the fool to withdraw turn the discourse another way and soon after rise from the table and dismiss u go to hear cause thus mr more i have run out into a tedious story of the length of which i have be ashamed if a you earnestly beg it of me i have not observe you to hearken to it a if you have no mind to lose any part of it i might have contract it but i resolve to give it you at large that you might observe how those that despise what i have propose no sooner perceive that the cardinal do not dislike it but presently approve of it fawn so on him and flatter him to such a degree that they in good earnest applaud those thing that he only like in jest and from hence you may gather how little courtier would value either me or my counsel to this i answer you have do me a great kindness in this relation for a everything have be relate by you both wisely and pleasantly so you have make me imagine that i be in my own country and grown young again by recall that good cardinal to my thought in whose family i be breed from my childhood and though you be upon other account very dear to me yet you be the dearer because you honour hi memory so much but after all this i can not change my opinion for i still think that if you could overcome that aversion which you have to the court of prince you might by the advice which it be in your power to give do a great deal of good to mankind and this be the chief design that every good man ought to propose to himself in live for your friend plato think that nation will be happy when either philosopher become king or king become philosopher it be no wonder if we be so far from that happiness while philosopher will not think it their duty to assist king with their counsel they be not so baseminded say he but that they would willingly do it many of them have already do it by their book if those that be in power would but hearken to their good advice but plato judge right that except king themselves become philosopher they who from their childhood be corrupt with false notion would never fall in entirely with the counsel of philosopher and this he himself find to be true in the person of dionysius do not you think that if i be about any king proposing good law to him and endeavour to root out all the cursed seed of evil that i find in him i should either be turn out of hi court or at least be laugh at for my pain for instance what could i signify if i be about the king of france and be call into hi cabinet council where several wise men in hi hearing be propose many expedient a by what art and practice milan may be keep and naples that have so often slip out of their hand recover how the venetian and after them the rest of italy may be subdue and then how flanders brabant and all burgundy and some other kingdom which he have swallow already in hi design may be add to hi empire one propose a league with the venetian to be keep as long a he find hi account in it and that he ought to communicate counsel with them and give them some share of the spoil till hi success make him need or fear them less and then it will be easily take out of their hand another propose the hire the german and the secure the switzers by pension another propose the gain the emperor by money which be omnipotent with him another propose a peace with the king of arragon and in order to cement it the yield up the king of navarres pretension another think that the prince of castile be to be work on by the hope of an alliance and that some of hi courtier be to be gain to the french faction by pension the hard point of all be what to do with england a treaty of peace be to be set on foot and if their alliance be not to be depend on yet it be to be make as firm a possible and they be to be call friend but suspect a enemy therefore the scot be to be keep in readiness to be let loose upon england on every occasion and some banished nobleman be to be support underhand for by the league it can not be do avowedly who have a pretension to the crown by which mean that suspect prince may be keep in awe now when thing be in so great a fermentation and so many gallant men be join counsel how to carry on the war if so mean a man a i should stand up and wish them to change all their counsel to let italy alone and stay at home since the kingdom of france be indeed great than could be well govern by one man that therefore he ought not to think of add other to it and if after this i should propose to them the resolution of the achorians a people that lie on the southeast of utopia who long ago engage in war in order to add to the dominion of their prince another kingdom to which he have some pretension by an ancient alliance this they conquer but find that the trouble of keep it be equal to that by which it be gain that the conquered people be always either in rebellion or expose to foreign invasion while they be oblige to be incessantly at war either for or against them and consequently could never disband their army that in the meantime they be oppress with tax their money go out of the kingdom their blood be spill for the glory of their king without procure the least advantage to the people who receive not the small benefit from it even in time of peace and that their manner be corrupt by a long war robbery and murder everywhere abound and their law fell into contempt while their king distract with the care of two kingdom be the less able to apply hi mind to the interest of either when they saw this and that there would be no end to these evil they by joint counsel make an humble address to their king desire him to choose which of the two kingdom he have the great mind to keep since he could not hold both for they be too great a people to be govern by a divide king since no man would willingly have a groom that should be in common between him and another upon which the good prince be force to quit hi new kingdom to one of hi friend who be not long after dethrone and to be content with hi old one to this i would add that after all those warlike attempt the vast confusion and the consumption both of treasure and of people that must follow them perhaps upon some misfortune they might be force to throw up all at last therefore it seem much more eligible that the king should improve hi ancient kingdom all he could and make it flourish as much a possible that he should love hi people and be beloved of them that he should live among them govern them gently and let other kingdoms alone since that which have fall to hi share be big enough if not too big for him pray how do you think would such a speech a this be hear i confess say i i think not very well but what say he if i should sort with another kind of minister whose chief contrivance and consultation be by what art the prince treasure might be increase where one propose raise the value of specie when the king debt be large and lower it when hi revenue be to come in that so he might both pay much with a little and in a little receive a great deal another propose a pretence of a war that money might be raise in order to carry it on and that a peace be conclude as soon a that be do and this with such appearance of religion a might work on the people and make them impute it to the piety of their prince and to hi tenderness for the life of hi subject a third offer some old musty law that have be antiquate by a long disuse and which a they have be forget by all the subject so they have also be break by them and propose the levy the penalty of these law that a it would bring in a vast treasure so there might be a very good pretence for it since it would look like the execute a law and the do of justice a fourth propose the prohibiting of many thing under severe penalty especially such a be against the interest of the people and then the dispense with these prohibition upon great composition to those who might find their advantage in break them this would serve two end both of them acceptable to many for a those whose avarice lead them to transgress would be severely fin so the selling licence dear would look a if a prince be tender of hi people and would not easily or at low rate dispense with anything that might be against the public good another propose that the judge must be make sure that they may declare always in favour of the prerogative that they must be often send for to court that the king may hear them argue those point in which he be concern since how unjust soever any of hi pretension may be yet still some one or other of them either out of contradiction to other or the pride of singularity or to make their court would find out some pretence or other to give the king a fair colour to carry the point for if the judge but differ in opinion the clear thing in the world be make by that mean disputable and truth be once bring in question the king may then take advantage to expound the law for hi own profit while the judge that stand out will be bring over either through fear or modesty and they be thus gain all of them may be send to the bench to give sentence boldly a the king would have it for fair pretence will never be want when sentence be to be give in the prince favour it will either be say that equity lie of hi side or some word in the law will be find sound that way or some force sense will be put on them and when all other thing fail the king undoubted prerogative will be pretend a that which be above all law and to which a religious judge ought to have a special regard thus all consent to that maxim of crassus that a prince can not have treasure enough since he must maintain hi army out of it that a king even though he would can do nothing unjustly that all property be in him not except the very person of hi subject and that no man have any other property but that which the king out of hi goodness think fit to leave him and they think it be the prince interest that there be a little of this leave a may be a if it be hi advantage that hi people should have neither rich nor liberty since these thing make them less easy and willing to submit to a cruel and unjust governmentwhereas necessity and poverty blunts them make them patient beat them down and break that height of spirit that might otherwise dispose them to rebel now what if after all these proposition be make i should rise up and assert that such counsel be both unbecoming a king and mischievous to him and that not only hi honour but hi safety consist more in hi people wealth than in hi own if i should show that they choose a king for their own sake and not for hi that by hi care and endeavour they may be both easy and safe and that therefore a prince ought to take more care of hi people happiness than of hi own a a shepherd be to take more care of hi flock than of himself it be also certain that they be much mistaken that think the poverty of a nation be a mean of the public safety who quarrel more than beggar who do more earnestly long for a change than he that be uneasy in hi present circumstance and who run to create confusion with so desperate a boldness a those who have nothing to lose hope to gain by them if a king should fall under such contempt or envy that he could not keep hi subject in their duty but by oppression and ill usage and by render them poor and miserable it be certainly good for him to quit hi kingdom than to retain it by such method a make him while he keep the name of authority lose the majesty due to it nor be it so become the dignity of a king to reign over beggar a over rich and happy subject and therefore fabricius a man of a noble and exalted temper say he would rather govern rich men than be rich himself since for one man to abound in wealth and pleasure when all about him be mourn and groan be to be a gaoler and not a king he be an unskilful physician that can not cure one disease without cast hi patient into another so he that can find no other way for correct the error of hi people but by take from them the convenience of life show that he know not what it be to govern a free nation he himself ought rather to shake off hi sloth or to lay down hi pride for the contempt or hatred that hi people have for him take it rise from the vice in himself let him live upon what belong to him without wrong other and accommodate hi expense to hi revenue let him punish crime and by hi wise conduct let him endeavour to prevent them rather than be severe when he have suffer them to be too common let him not rashly revive law that be abrogate by disuse especially if they have be long forget and never want and let him never take any penalty for the breach of them to which a judge would not give way in a private man but would look on him a a crafty and unjust person for pretend to it to these thing i would add that law among the macarians a people that live not far from utopia by which their king on the day on which he begin to reign be tie by an oath confirm by solemn sacrifice never to have at once above a thousand pound of gold in hi treasure or so much silver a be equal to that in value this law they tell u be make by an excellent king who have more regard to the rich of hi country than to hi own wealth and therefore provide against the heap up of so much treasure a might impoverish the people he think that moderate sum might be sufficient for any accident if either the king have occasion for it against the rebel or the kingdom against the invasion of an enemy but that it be not enough to encourage a prince to invade other men right a circumstance that be the chief cause of hi make that law he also think that it be a good provision for that free circulation of money so necessary for the course of commerce and exchange and when a king must distribute all those extraordinary accession that increase treasure beyond the due pitch it make him less dispose to oppress hi subject such a king a this will be the terror of ill men and will be beloved by all the good if i say i should talk of these or suchlike thing to men that have take their bias another way how deaf would they be to all i could say no doubt very deaf answer i and no wonder for one be never to offer proposition or advice that we be certain will not be entertain discourse so much out of the road could not avail anything nor have any effect on men whose mind be prepossess with different sentiment this philosophical way of speculation be not unpleasant among friend in a free conversation but there be no room for it in the court of prince where great affair be carry on by authority that be what i be say reply he that there be no room for philosophy in the court of prince yes there be say i but not for this speculative philosophy that make everything to be alike fit at all time but there be another philosophy that be more pliable that know it proper scene accommodate itself to it and teach a man with propriety and decency to act that part which have fall to hi share if when one of plautus comedy be upon the stage and a company of servant be act their part you should come out in the garb of a philosopher and repeat out of octavia a discourse of seneca to nero would it not be good for you to say nothing than by mix thing of such different nature to make an impertinent tragicomedy for you spoil and corrupt the play that be in hand when you mix with it thing of an opposite nature even though they be much good therefore go through with the play that be act the best you can and do not confound it because another that be pleasant come into your thought it be even so in a commonwealth and in the council of prince if ill opinion can not be quite root out and you can not cure some received vice accord to your wish you must not therefore abandon the commonwealth for the same reason a you should not forsake the ship in a storm because you can not command the wind you be not oblige to assault people with discourse that be out of their road when you see that their received notion must prevent your make an impression upon them you ought rather to cast about and to manage thing with all the dexterity in your power so that if you be not able to make them go well they may be a little ill a possible for except all men be good everything can not be right and that be a blessing that i do not at present hope to see accord to your argument answer he all that i could be able to do would be to preserve myself from be mad while i endeavour to cure the madness of other for if i speak with i must repeat what i have say to you and a for lie whether a philosopher can do it or not i can not tell i be sure i can not do it but though these discourse may be uneasy and ungrateful to them i do not see why they should seem foolish or extravagant indeed if i should either propose such thing a plato have contrive in hi commonwealth or a the utopian practise in theirs though they might seem well a certainly they be yet they be so different from our establishment which be found on property there be no such thing among them that i could not expect that it would have any effect on them but such discourse a mine which only call past evil to mind and give warning of what may follow leave nothing in them that be so absurd that they may not be use at any time for they can only be unpleasant to those who be resolve to run headlong the contrary way and if we must let alone everything a absurd or extravagant which by reason of the wicked life of many may seem uncouth we must even among christian give over press the great part of those thing that christ hath teach u though he have command u not to conceal them but to proclaim on the housetop that which he teach in secret the great part of hi precept be more opposite to the life of the men of this age than any part of my discourse have be but the preacher seem to have learn that craft to which you advise me for they observe that the world would not willingly suit their life to the rule that christ have give have fit hi doctrine a if it have be a leaden rule to their life that so some way or other they might agree with one another but i see no other effect of this compliance except it be that men become more secure in their wickedness by it and this be all the success that i can have in a court for i must always differ from the rest and then i shall signify nothing or if i agree with them i shall then only help forward their madness i do not comprehend what you mean by your cast about or by the bending and handle thing so dexterously that if they go not well they may go as little ill a may be for in court they will not bear with a man hold hi peace or conniving at what other do a man must barefacedly approve of the bad counsel and consent to the black design so that he would pass for a spy or possibly for a traitor that do but coldly approve of such wicked practice and therefore when a man be engage in such a society he will be so far from be able to mend matter by hi cast about a you call it that he will find no occasion of do any good the ill company will sooner corrupt him than be the good for him or if notwithstanding all their ill company he still remain steady and innocent yet their folly and knavery will be impute to him and by mix counsel with them he must bear hi share of all the blame that belong wholly to other it be no ill simile by which plato set forth the unreason of a philosopher meddle with governmentif a man say he be to see a great company run out every day into the rain and take delight in be wet if he know that it would be to no purpose for him to go and persuade them to return to their house in order to avoid the storm and that all that could be expect by hi go to speak to them would be that he himself should be as wet a they it would be best for him to keep within door and since he have not influence enough to correct other people folly to take care to preserve himself though to speak plainly my real sentiment i must freely own that as long a there be any property and while money be the standard of all other thing i can not think that a nation can be govern either justly or happily not justly because the best thing will fall to the share of the bad men nor happily because all thing will be divide among a few and even these be not in all respect happy the rest be leave to be absolutely miserable therefore when i reflect on the wise and good constitution of the utopian among whom all thing be so well govern and with so few law where virtue hath it due reward and yet there be such an equality that every man live in plenty when i compare with them so many other nation that be still make new law and yet can never bring their constitution to a right regulation where notwithstanding every one have hi property yet all the law that they can invent have not the power either to obtain or preserve it or even to enable men certainly to distinguish what be their own from what be anothers of which the many lawsuit that every day break out and be eternally depend give too plain a demonstration when i say i balance all these thing in my thought i grow more favourable to plato and do not wonder that he resolve not to make any law for such a would not submit to a community of all thing for so wise a man could not but foresee that the set all upon a level be the only way to make a nation happy which can not be obtain so long a there be property for when every man draw to himself all that he can compass by one title or another it must need follow that how plentiful soever a nation may be yet a few divide the wealth of it among themselves the rest must fall into indigence so that there will be two sort of people among them who deserve that their fortune should be interchange the former useless but wicked and ravenous and the latter who by their constant industry serve the public more than themselves sincere and modest men from whence i be persuade that till property be take away there can be no equitable or just distribution of thing nor can the world be happily govern for as long a that be maintain the great and the far best part of mankind will be still oppress with a load of care and anxiety i confess without take it quite away those pressure that lie on a great part of mankind may be make light but they can never be quite remove for if law be make to determine at how great an extent in soil and at how much money every man must stop to limit the prince that he might not grow too great and to restrain the people that they might not become too insolent and that none might factious aspire to public employment which ought neither to be sell nor make burdensome by a great expense since otherwise those that serve in them would be tempt to reimburse themselves by cheat and violence and it would become necessary to find out rich men for undergo those employment which ought rather to be trust to the wise these law i say might have such effect a good diet and care might have on a sick man whose recovery be desperate they might allay and mitigate the disease but it could never be quite heal nor the body politic be bring again to a good habit as long a property remains and it will fall out a in a complication of disease that by apply a remedy to one sore you will provoke another and that which remove the one ill symptom produce other while the strengthen one part of the body weaken the rest on the contrary answer i it seem to me that men can not live conveniently where all thing be common how can there be any plenty where every man will excuse himself from labour for a the hope of gain doth not excite him so the confidence that he have in other men industry may make him slothful if people come to be pinch with want and yet can not dispose of anything a their own what can follow upon this but perpetual sedition and bloodshed especially when the reverence and authority due to magistrate fall to the ground for i can not imagine how that can be keep up among those that be in all thing equal to one another i do not wonder say he that it appear so to you since you have no notion or at least no right one of such a constitution but if you have be in utopia with me and have see their law and rule a i do for the space of five year in which i live among them and during which time i be so delighted with them that indeed i should never have leave them if it have not be to make the discovery of that new world to the european you would then confess that you have never see a people so well constitute a they you will not easily persuade me say peter that any nation in that new world be well govern than those among u for a our understanding be not bad than theirs so our governmentif i mistake not be more ancient a long practice have help u to find out many convenience of life and some happy chance have discover other thing to u which no man understand could ever have invent a for the antiquity either of their governmentor of ours say he you can not pass a true judgment of it unless you have read their history for if they be to be believe they have town among them before these part be so much a inhabited and a for those discovery that have be either hit on by chance or make by ingenious men these might have happen there as well a here i do not deny but we be more ingenious than they be but they exceed u much in industry and application they know little concern u before our arrival among them they call u all by a general name of the nation that lie beyond the equinoctial line for their chronicle mention a shipwreck that be make on their coast twelve hundred year ago and that some roman and egyptian that be in the ship get safe ashore spend the rest of their day amongst them and such be their ingenuity that from this single opportunity they draw the advantage of learn from those unlookedfor guest and acquire all the useful art that be then among the roman and which be know to these shipwreck men and by the hint that they give them they themselves find out even some of those art which they could not fully explain so happily do they improve that accident of have some of our people cast upon their shore but if such an accident have at any time bring any from thence into europe we have be so far from improve it that we do not so much a remember it a in aftertimes perhaps it will be forget by our people that i be ever there for though they from one such accident make themselves master of all the good invention that be among u yet i believe it would be long before we should learn or put in practice any of the good institution that be among them and this be the true cause of their be well govern and live happy than we though we come not short of them in point of understand or outward advantage upon this i say to him i earnestly beg you would describe that island very particularly to u be not too short but set out in order all thing relate to their soil their river their town their people their manner constitution law and in a word all that you imagine we desire to know and you may well imagine that we desire to know everything concern them of which we be hitherto ignorant i will do it very willingly say he for i have digest the whole matter carefully but it will take up some time let u go then say i first and dine and then we shall have leisure enough he consent we go in and din and after dinner come back and sit down in the same place i order my servant to take care that none might come and interrupt u and both peter and i desire raphael to be as good a hi word when he saw that we be very intent upon it he pause a little to recollect himself and begin in this manner the island of utopia be in the middle two hundred mile broad and hold almost at the same breadth over a great part of it but it grow narrow towards both end it figure be not unlike a crescent between it horn the sea come in eleven mile broad and spread itself into a great bay which be environ with land to the compass of about five hundred mile and be well secure from wind in this bay there be no great current the whole coast be a it be one continue harbour which give all that live in the island great convenience for mutual commerce but the entry into the bay occasion by rock on the one hand and shallow on the other be very dangerous in the middle of it there be one single rock which appear above water and may therefore easily be avoid and on the top of it there be a tower in which a garrison be keep the other rock lie under water and be very dangerous the channel be know only to the native so that if any stranger should enter into the bay without one of their pilot he would run great danger of shipwreck for even they themselves could not pass it safe if some mark that be on the coast do not direct their way and if these should be but a little shifted any fleet that might come against them how great soever it be would be certainly lose on the other side of the island there be likewise many harbour and the coast be so fortified both by nature and art that a small number of men can hinder the descent of a great army but they report and there remain good mark of it to make it credible that this be no island at first but a part of the continent utopus that conquer it whose name it still carry for abraxa be it first name bring the rude and uncivilised inhabitant into such a good governmentand to that measure of politeness that they now far excel all the rest of mankind having soon subdue them he design to separate them from the continent and to bring the sea quite round them to accomplish this he order a deep channel to be dug fifteen mile long and that the native might not think he treat them like slave he not only force the inhabitant but also hi own soldier to labour in carry it on a he set a vast number of men to work he beyond all men expectation bring it to a speedy conclusion and hi neighbour who at first laugh at the folly of the undertaking no sooner saw it bring to perfection than they be strike with admiration and terror there be fiftyfour city in the island all large and well build the manner custom and law of which be the same and they be all contrive a near in the same manner a the ground on which they stand will allow the near lie at least twentyfour mile distance from one another and the most remote be not so far distant but that a man can go on foot in one day from it to that which lie next it every city send three of their wise senator once a year to amaurot to consult about their common concern for that be the chief town of the island be situate near the centre of it so that it be the most convenient place for their assembly the jurisdiction of every city extend at least twenty mile and where the town lie wider they have much more ground no town desire to enlarge it bound for the people consider themselves rather a tenant than landlord they have build over all the country farmhouses for husbandman which be well contrive and furnish with all thing necessary for country labour inhabitant be send by turn from the city to dwell in them no country family have few than forty men and woman in it besides two slave there be a master and a mistress set over every family and over thirty family there be a magistrate every year twenty of this family come back to the town after they have stay two year in the country and in their room there be other twenty send from the town that they may learn country work from those that have be already one year in the country a they must teach those that come to them the next from the town by this mean such a dwell in those country farm be never ignorant of agriculture and so commit no error which might otherwise be fatal and bring them under a scarcity of corn but though there be every year such a shifting of the husbandman to prevent any man be force against hi will to follow that hard course of life too long yet many among them take such pleasure in it that they desire leave to continue in it many year these husbandman till the ground breed cattle hew wood and convey it to the town either by land or water a be most convenient they breed an infinite multitude of chicken in a very curious manner for the hen do not sit and hatch them but a vast number of egg be lay in a gentle and equal heat in order to be hatch and they be no sooner out of the shell and able to stir about but they seem to consider those that fee them a their mother and follow them a other chicken do the hen that hatch them they breed very few horse but those they have be full of mettle and be keep only for exercise their youth in the art of sit and rid them for they do not put them to any work either of plough or carriage in which they employ ox for though their horse be strong yet they find oxen can hold out long and a they be not subject to so many disease so they be keep upon a less charge and with less trouble and even when they be so worn out that they be no more fit for labour they be good meat at last they sow no corn but that which be to be their bread for they drink either wine cider or perry and often water sometimes boil with honey or liquorice with which they abound and though they know exactly how much corn will serve every town and all that tract of country which belong to it yet they sow much more and breed more cattle than be necessary for their consumption and they give that overplus of which they make no use to their neighbour when they want anything in the country which it do not produce they fetch that from the town without carry anything in exchange for it and the magistrate of the town take care to see it give them for they meet generally in the town once a month upon a festival day when the time of harvest come the magistrate in the country send to those in the town and let them know how many hand they will need for reap the harvest and the number they call for be send to them they commonly despatch it all in one day he that know one of their town know them all they be so like one another except where the situation make some difference i shall therefore describe one of them and none be so proper a amaurot for a none be more eminent all the rest yielding in precedence to this because it be the seat of their supreme council so there be none of them good know to me i have live five year all together in it it lie upon the side of a hill or rather a rise ground it figure be almost square for from the one side of it which shoot up almost to the top of the hill it run down in a descent for two mile to the river anider but it be a little broad the other way that run along by the bank of that river the anider rise about eighty mile above amaurot in a small spring at first but other brook fall into it of which two be more considerable than the rest a it run by amaurot it be grow half a mile broad but it still grow large and large till after sixty mile course below it it be lose in the ocean between the town and the sea and for some mile above the town it ebb and flow every six hour with a strong current the tide come up about thirty mile so full that there be nothing but salt water in the river the fresh water be drive back with it force and above that for some mile the water be brackish but a little high a it run by the town it be quite fresh and when the tide ebb it continue fresh all along to the sea there be a bridge cast over the river not of timber but of fair stone consist of many stately arch it lie at that part of the town which be farthest from the sea so that the ship without any hindrance lie all along the side of the town there be likewise another river that run by it which though it be not great yet it run pleasantly for it rise out of the same hill on which the town stand and so run down through it and fall into the anider the inhabitant have fortify the fountainhead of this river which spring a little without the town that so if they should happen to be besiege the enemy might not be able to stop or divert the course of the water nor poison it from thence it be carry in earthen pipe to the low street and for those place of the town to which the water of that small river can not be convey they have great cistern for receive the rainwater which supply the want of the other the town be compass with a high and thick wall in which there be many tower and fort there be also a broad and deep dry ditch set thick with thorn cast round three side of the town and the river be instead of a ditch on the fourth side the street be very convenient for all carriage and be well shelter from the wind their building be good and be so uniform that a whole side of a street look like one house the street be twenty foot broad there lie garden behind all their house these be large but enclose with building that on all hand face the street so that every house have both a door to the street and a back door to the garden their door have all two leaf which a they be easily open so they shut of their own accord and there be no property among them every man may freely enter into any house whatsoever at every ten year end they shift their house by lot they cultivate their garden with great care so that they have both vine fruit herb and flower in them and all be so well ordered and so finely kept that i never saw garden anywhere that be both so fruitful and so beautiful a theirs and this humour of order their garden so well be not only keep up by the pleasure they find in it but also by an emulation between the inhabitant of the several street who vie with each other and there be indeed nothing belonging to the whole town that be both more useful and more pleasant so that he who found the town seem to have take care of nothing more than of their garden for they say the whole scheme of the town be design at first by utopus but he leave all that belong to the ornament and improvement of it to be add by those that should come after him that be too much for one man to bring to perfection their record that contain the history of their town and state be preserve with an exact care and run backwards seventeen hundred and sixty year from these it appear that their house be at first low and mean like cottage make of any sort of timber and be build with mud wall and thatch with straw but now their house be three storey high the front of them be face either with stone plastering or brick and between the facing of their wall they throw in their rubbish their roof be flat and on them they lay a sort of plaster which cost very little and yet be so tempered that it be not apt to take fire and yet resist the weather more than lead they have great quantity of glass among them with which they glaze their window they use also in their window a thin linen cloth that be so oiled or gum that it both keep out the wind and give free admission to the light thirty family choose every year a magistrate who be anciently call the syphogrant but be now call the philarch and over every ten syphogrants with the family subject to them there be another magistrate who be anciently call the tranibore but of late the archphilarch all the syphogrants who be in number two hundred choose the prince out of a list of four who be name by the people of the four division of the city but they take an oath before they proceed to an election that they will choose him whom they think most fit for the office they give him their voice secretly so that it be not know for whom every one give hi suffrage the prince be for life unless he be remove upon suspicion of some design to enslave the people the tranibors be new choose every year but yet they be for the most part continue all their other magistrate be only annual the tranibors meet every third day and oftener if necessary and consult with the prince either concern the affair of the state in general or such private difference a may arise sometimes among the people though that fall out but seldom there be always two syphogrants call into the council chamber and these be change every day it be a fundamental rule of their governmentthat no conclusion can be make in anything that relate to the public till it have be first debate three several day in their council it be death for any to meet and consult concern the state unless it be either in their ordinary council or in the assembly of the whole body of the people these thing have be so provide among them that the prince and the tranibors may not conspire together to change the governmentand enslave the people and therefore when anything of great importance be set on foot it be send to the syphogrants who after they have communicate it to the family that belong to their division and have consider it among themselves make report to the senate and upon great occasion the matter be refer to the council of the whole island one rule observe in their council be never to debate a thing on the same day in which it be first propose for that be always refer to the next meeting that so men may not rashly and in the heat of discourse engage themselves too soon which might bias them so much that instead of consult the good of the public they might rather study to support their first opinion and by a perverse and preposterous sort of shame hazard their country rather than endanger their own reputation or venture the be suspect to have want foresight in the expedient that they at first propose and therefore to prevent this they take care that they may rather be deliberate than sudden in their motion agriculture be that which be so universally understood among them that no person either man or woman be ignorant of it they be instruct in it from their childhood partly by what they learn at school and partly by practice they be lead out often into the field about the town where they not only see other at work but be likewise exercise in it themselves besides agriculture which be so common to them all every man have some peculiar trade to which he apply himself such a the manufacture of wool or flax masonry smiths work or carpenter work for there be no sort of trade that be in great esteem among them throughout the island they wear the same sort of clothes without any other distinction except what be necessary to distinguish the two sex and the married and unmarried the fashion never alters and a it be neither disagreeable nor uneasy so it be suit to the climate and calculate both for their summer and winter every family make their own clothes but all among them woman as well a men learn one or other of the trade formerly mention woman for the most part deal in wool and flax which suit best with their weakness leave the ruder trade to the men the same trade generally pass down from father to son inclination often follow descent but if any man genius lie another way he be by adoption translate into a family that deal in the trade to which he be incline and when that be to be do care be take not only by hi father but by the magistrate that he may be put to a discreet and good man and if after a person have learn one trade he desire to acquire another that be also allow and be manage in the same manner a the former when he have learn both he follow that which he like best unless the public have more occasion for the other the chief and almost the only business of the syphogrants be to take care that no man may live idle but that every one may follow hi trade diligently yet they do not wear themselves out with perpetual toil from morning to night a if they be beast of burden which a it be indeed a heavy slavery so it be everywhere the common course of life amongst all mechanic except the utopian but they divide the day and night into twentyfour hour appoint six of these for work three of which be before dinner and three after they then sup and at eight oclock count from noon go to bed and sleep eight hour the rest of their time besides that take up in work eating and sleeping be leave to every man discretion yet they be not to abuse that interval to luxury and idleness but must employ it in some proper exercise accord to their various inclination which be for the most part read it be ordinary to have public lecture every morning before daybreak at which none be oblige to appear but those who be mark out for literature yet a great many both men and woman of all rank go to hear lecture of one sort or other accord to their inclination but if other that be not make for contemplation choose rather to employ themselves at that time in their trade a many of them do they be not hinder but be rather commend a men that take care to serve their country after supper they spend an hour in some diversion in summer in their garden and in winter in the hall where they eat where they entertain each other either with music or discourse they do not so much a know dice or any such foolish and mischievous game they have however two sort of game not unlike our chess the one be between several number in which one number a it be consume another the other resemble a battle between the virtue and the vice in which the enmity in the vice among themselves and their agreement against virtue be not unpleasantly represent together with the special opposition between the particular virtue and vice a also the method by which vice either openly assault or secretly undermines virtue and virtue on the other hand resists it but the time appoint for labour be to be narrowly examined otherwise you may imagine that since there be only six hour appoint for work they may fall under a scarcity of necessary provision but it be so far from be true that this time be not sufficient for supply them with plenty of all thing either necessary or convenient that it be rather too much and this you will easily apprehend if you consider how great a part of all other nation be quite idle first woman generally do little who be the half of mankind and if some few woman be diligent their husband be idle then consider the great company of idle priest and of those that be call religious men add to these all rich men chiefly those that have estate in land who be call nobleman and gentleman together with their family make up of idle person that be keep more for show than use add to these all those strong and lusty beggar that go about pretend some disease in excuse for their begging and upon the whole account you will find that the number of those by whose labour mankind be supply be much less than you perhaps imagine then consider how few of those that work be employ in labour that be of real service for we who measure all thing by money give rise to many trade that be both vain and superfluous and serve only to support riot and luxury for if those who work be employ only in such thing a the convenience of life require there would be such an abundance of them that the price of them would so sink that tradesman could not be maintain by their gain if all those who labour about useless thing be set to more profitable employment and if all they that languish out their life in sloth and idleness every one of whom consumes as much a any two of the men that be at work be force to labour you may easily imagine that a small proportion of time would serve for do all that be either necessary profitable or pleasant to mankind especially while pleasure be keep within it due bound this appear very plainly in utopia for there in a great city and in all the territory that lie round it you can scarce find five hundred either men or woman by their age and strength capable of labour that be not engage in it even the syphogrants though excuse by the law yet do not excuse themselves but work that by their example they may excite the industry of the rest of the people the like exemption be allow to those who be recommend to the people by the priest be by the secret suffrage of the syphogrants privilege from labour that they may apply themselves wholly to study and if any of these fall short of those hope that they seem at first to give they be oblige to return to work and sometimes a mechanic that so employ hi leisure hour a to make a considerable advancement in learning be ease from be a tradesman and rank among their learn men out of these they choose their ambassador their priest their tranibors and the prince himself anciently call their barzenes but be call of late their ademus and thus from the great number among them that be neither suffer to be idle nor to be employ in any fruitless labour you may easily make the estimate how much may be do in those few hour in which they be oblige to labour but besides all that have be already say it be to be consider that the needful art among them be manage with less labour than anywhere els the building or the repairing of house among u employ many hand because often a thriftless heir suffers a house that hi father build to fall into decay so that hi successor must at a great cost repair that which he might have keep up with a small charge it frequently happen that the same house which one person build at a vast expense be neglect by another who think he have a more delicate sense of the beauty of architecture and he suffer it to fall to ruin build another at no less charge but among the utopian all thing be so regulated that men very seldom build upon a new piece of ground and be not only very quick in repair their house but show their foresight in prevent their decay so that their building be preserve very long with but very little labour and thus the builder to whom that care belongs be often without employment except the hewing of timber and the squaring of stone that the material may be in readiness for raise a building very suddenly when there be any occasion for it a to their clothes observe how little work be spend in them while they be at labour they be clothe with leather and skin cut carelessly about them which will last seven year and when they appear in public they put on an upper garment which hide the other and these be all of one colour and that be the natural colour of the wool a they need less woollen cloth than be use anywhere els so that which they make use of be much less costly they use linen cloth more but that be prepare with less labour and they value cloth only by the whiteness of the linen or the cleanness of the wool without much regard to the fineness of the thread while in other place four or five upper garment of woollen cloth of different colour and a many vest of silk will scarce serve one man and while those that be nice think ten too few every man there be content with one which very often serve him two year nor be there anything that can tempt a man to desire more for if he have them he would neither be the warm nor would he make one jot the good appearance for it and thus since they be all employ in some useful labour and since they content themselves with few thing it fall out that there be a great abundance of all thing among them so that it frequently happen that for want of other work vast number be send out to mend the highway but when no public undertaking be to be perform the hour of work be lessen the magistrate never engage the people in unnecessary labour since the chief end of the constitution be to regulate labour by the necessity of the public and to allow the people a much time a be necessary for the improvement of their mind in which they think the happiness of life consist but it be now time to explain to you the mutual intercourse of this people their commerce and the rule by which all thing be distribute among them a their city be compose of family so their family be make up of those that be nearly relate to one another their woman when they grow up be marry out but all the male both child and grandchild live still in the same house in great obedience to their common parent unless age have weaken hi understanding and in that case he that be next to him in age come in hi room but l any city should become either too great or by any accident be dispeopled provision be make that none of their city may contain above six thousand family besides those of the country around it no family may have less than ten and more than sixteen person in it but there can be no determined number for the child under age this rule be easily observe by remove some of the child of a more fruitful couple to any other family that do not abound so much in them by the same rule they supply city that do not increase so fast from other that breed fast and if there be any increase over the whole island then they draw out a number of their citizen out of the several town and send them over to the neighbouring continent where if they find that the inhabitant have more soil than they can well cultivate they fix a colony take the inhabitant into their society if they be willing to live with them and where they do that of their own accord they quickly enter into their method of life and conform to their rule and this prove a happiness to both nation for accord to their constitution such care be take of the soil that it become fruitful enough for both though it might be otherwise too narrow and barren for any one of them but if the native refuse to conform themselves to their law they drive them out of those bound which they mark out for themselves and use force if they resist for they account it a very just cause of war for a nation to hinder other from possess a part of that soil of which they make no use but which be suffer to lie idle and uncultivated since every man have by the law of nature a right to such a waste portion of the earth a be necessary for hi subsistence if an accident have so lessen the number of the inhabitant of any of their town that it can not be make up from the other town of the island without diminish them too much which be say to have fall out but twice since they be first a people when great number be carry off by the plague the loss be then supply by recall as many a be want from their colony for they will abandon these rather than suffer the town in the island to sink too low but to return to their manner of living in society the old man of every family a have be already say be it governor wife serve their husband and child their parent and always the young serve the elder every city be divide into four equal part and in the middle of each there be a marketplace what be bring thither and manufacture by the several family be carry from thence to house appoint for that purpose in which all thing of a sort be lay by themselves and thither every father go and take whatsoever he or hi family stand in need of without either pay for it or leave anything in exchange there be no reason for give a denial to any person since there be such plenty of everything among them and there be no danger of a man ask for more than he need they have no inducement to do this since they be sure they shall always be supply it be the fear of want that make any of the whole race of animal either greedy or ravenous but besides fear there be in man a pride that make him fancy it a particular glory to excel other in pomp and excess but by the law of the utopian there be no room for this near these market there be other for all sort of provision where there be not only herbs fruit and bread but also fish fowl and cattle there be also without their town place appoint near some running water for kill their beast and for wash away their filth which be do by their slave for they suffer none of their citizen to kill their cattle because they think that pity and goodnature which be among the best of those affection that be bear with u be much impair by the butchering of animal nor do they suffer anything that be foul or unclean to be bring within their town l the air should be infect by illsmells which might prejudice their health in every street there be great hall that lie at an equal distance from each other distinguish by particular name the syphogrants dwell in those that be set over thirty family fifteen lie on one side of it and as many on the other in these hall they all meet and have their repast the steward of every one of them come to the marketplace at an appoint hour and accord to the number of those that belong to the hall they carry home provision but they take more care of their sick than of any other these be lodge and provide for in public hospital they have belong to every town four hospital that be build without their wall and be so large that they may pass for little town by this mean if they have ever such a number of sick person they could lodge them conveniently and at such a distance that such of them a be sick of infectious disease may be keep so far from the rest that there can be no danger of contagion the hospital be furnish and store with all thing that be convenient for the ease and recovery of the sick and those that be put in them be look after with such tender and watchful care and be so constantly attend by their skilful physician that a none be send to them against their will so there be scarce one in a whole town that if he should fall ill would not choose rather to go thither than lie sick at home after the steward of the hospital have take for the sick whatsoever the physician prescribes then the best thing that be leave in the market be distribute equally among the hall in proportion to their number only in the first place they serve the prince the chief priest the tranibors the ambassador and stranger if there be any which indeed fall out but seldom and for whom there be house well furnish particularly appoint for their reception when they come among them at the hour of dinner and supper the whole syphogranty be call together by sound of trumpet they meet and eat together except only such a be in the hospital or lie sick at home yet after the hall be serve no man be hinder to carry provision home from the marketplace for they know that none do that but for some good reason for though any that will may eat at home yet none do it willingly since it be both ridiculous and foolish for any to give themselves the trouble to make ready an ill dinner at home when there be a much more plentiful one make ready for him so near hand all the uneasy and sordid service about these hall be perform by their slave but the dressing and cook their meat and the order their table belong only to the woman all those of every family take it by turn they sit at three or more table accord to their number the men sit towards the wall and the woman sit on the other side that if any of them should be take suddenly ill which be no uncommon case amongst woman with child she may without disturb the rest rise and go to the nurse room who be there with the sucking child where there be always clean water at hand and cradle in which they may lay the young child if there be occasion for it and a fire that they may shift and dress them before it every child be nurse by it own mother if death or sickness do not intervene and in that case the syphogrants wife find out a nurse quickly which be no hard matter for any one that can do it offer herself cheerfully for a they be much incline to that piece of mercy so the child whom they nurse considers the nurse a it mother all the child under five year old sit among the nurse the rest of the young sort of both sex till they be fit for marriage either serve those that sit at table or if they be not strong enough for that stand by them in great silence and eat what be give them nor have they any other formality of din in the middle of the first table which stand across the upper end of the hall sit the syphogrant and hi wife for that be the chief and most conspicuous place next to him sit two of the most ancient for there go always four to a mess if there be a temple within the syphogranty the priest and hi wife sit with the syphogrant above all the rest next them there be a mixture of old and young who be so placed that a the young be set near other so they be mixed with the more ancient which they say be appoint on this account that the gravity of the old people and the reverence that be due to them might restrain the young from all indecent word and gesture dish be not serve up to the whole table at first but the best be first set before the old whose seat be distinguish from the young and after them all the rest be serve alike the old men distribute to the young any curious meat that happen to be set before them if there be not such an abundance of them that the whole company may be serve alike thus old men be honour with a particular respect yet all the rest fare as well a they both dinner and supper be begin with some lecture of morality that be read to them but it be so short that it be not tedious nor uneasy to them to hear it from hence the old men take occasion to entertain those about them with some useful and pleasant enlargement but they do not engross the whole discourse so to themselves during their meal that the young may not put in for a share on the contrary they engage them to talk that so they may in that free way of conversation find out the force of every one spirit and observe hi temper they despatch their dinner quickly but sit long at supper because they go to work after the one and be to sleep after the other during which they think the stomach carry on the concoction more vigorously they never sup without music and there be always fruit serve up after meat while they be at table some burn perfume and sprinkle about fragrant ointment and sweet water in short they want nothing that may cheer up their spirit they give themselves a large allowance that way and indulge themselves in all such pleasure a be attend with no inconvenience thus do those that be in the town live together but in the country where they live at a great distance every one eats at home and no family want any necessary sort of provision for it be from them that provision be send unto those that live in the town if any man have a mind to visit hi friend that live in some other town or desire to travel and see the rest of the country he obtain leave very easily from the syphogrant and tranibors when there be no particular occasion for him at home such a travel carry with them a passport from the prince which both certify the licence that be grant for travel and limit the time of their return they be furnish with a waggon and a slave who drive the ox and look after them but unless there be woman in the company the waggon be send back at the end of the journey a a needless encumbrance while they be on the road they carry no provision with them yet they want for nothing but be everywhere treat a if they be at home if they stay in any place long than a night every one follow hi proper occupation and be very well use by those of hi own trade but if any man go out of the city to which he belong without leave and be find ramble without a passport he be severely treat he be punish a a fugitive and send home disgracefully and if he fall again into the like fault be condemn to slavery if any man have a mind to travel only over the precinct of hi own city he may freely do it with hi father permission and hi wifes consent but when he come into any of the country house if he expect to be entertain by them he must labour with them and conform to their rule and if he do this he may freely go over the whole precinct be then as useful to the city to which he belong a if he be still within it thus you see that there be no idle person among them nor pretence of excuse any from labour there be no taverns no alehouse nor stew among them nor any other occasion of corrupt each other of get into corner or form themselves into party all men live in full view so that all be oblige both to perform their ordinary task and to employ themselves well in their spare hour and it be certain that a people thus order must live in great abundance of all thing and these be equally distribute among them no man can want or be oblige to beg in their great council at amaurot to which there be three sent from every town once a year they examine what towns abound in provision and what be under any scarcity that so the one may be furnish from the other and this be do freely without any sort of exchange for accord to their plenty or scarcity they supply or be supply from one another so that indeed the whole island be a it be one family when they have thus take care of their whole country and lay up store for two year which they do to prevent the ill consequence of an unfavourable season they order an exportation of the overplus both of corn honey wool flax wood wax tallow leather and cattle which they send out commonly in great quantity to other nation they order a seventh part of all these good to be freely give to the poor of the country to which they send them and sell the rest at moderate rate and by this exchange they not only bring back those few thing that they need at home for indeed they scarce need anything but iron but likewise a great deal of gold and silver and by their driving this trade so long it be not to be imagine how vast a treasure they have get among them so that now they do not much care whether they sell off their merchandise for money in hand or upon trust a great part of their treasure be now in bond but in all their contract no private man stand bound but the writing run in the name of the town and the town that owe them money raise it from those private hand that owe it to them lay it up in their public chamber or enjoy the profit of it till the utopian call for it and they choose rather to let the great part of it lie in their hand who make advantage by it than to call for it themselves but if they see that any of their other neighbour stand more in need of it then they call it in and lend it to them whenever they be engage in war which be the only occasion in which their treasure can be usefully employ they make use of it themselves in great extremity or sudden accident they employ it in hire foreign troop whom they more willingly expose to danger than their own people they give them great pay know well that this will work even on their enemy that it will engage them either to betray their own side or at least to desert it and that it be the best mean of raise mutual jealousy among them for this end they have an incredible treasure but they do not keep it a a treasure but in such a manner a i be almost afraid to tell l you think it so extravagant a to be hardly credible this i have the more reason to apprehend because if i have not see it myself i could not have be easily persuade to have believe it upon any man report it be certain that all thing appear incredible to u in proportion a they differ from know custom but one who can judge aright will not wonder to find that since their constitution differs so much from ours their value of gold and silver should be measure by a very different standard for since they have no use for money among themselves but keep it a a provision against event which seldom happen and between which there be generally long intervene interval they value it no farther than it deserve that be in proportion to it use so that it be plain they must prefer iron either to gold or silver for men can no more live without iron than without fire or water but nature have mark out no use for the other metal so essential a not easily to be dispense with the folly of men have enhance the value of gold and silver because of their scarcity whereas on the contrary it be their opinion that nature a an indulgent parent have freely give u all the best thing in great abundance such a water and earth but have lay up and hid from u the thing that be vain and useless if these metal be lay up in any tower in the kingdom it would raise a jealousy of the prince and senate and give birth to that foolish mistrust into which the people be apt to fall a jealousy of their intending to sacrifice the interest of the public to their own private advantage if they should work it into vessel or any sort of plate they fear that the people might grow too fond of it and so be unwilling to let the plate be run down if a war make it necessary to employ it in pay their soldier to prevent all these inconvenience they have fall upon an expedient which a it agree with their other policy so be it very different from ours and will scarce gain belief among u who value gold so much and lay it up so carefully they eat and drink out of vessel of earth or glass which make an agreeable appearance though form of brittle material while they make their chamberpot and closestools of gold and silver and that not only in their public hall but in their private house of the same metal they likewise make chain and fetter for their slave to some of which a a badge of infamy they hang an earring of gold and make other wear a chain or a coronet of the same metal and thus they take care by all possible mean to render gold and silver of no esteem and from hence it be that while other nation part with their gold and silver as unwillingly a if one tore out their bowel those of utopia would look on their give in all they possess of those metal when there be any use for them but a the parting with a trifle or a we would esteem the loss of a penny they find pearl on their coast and diamond and carbuncle on their rock they do not look after them but if they find them by chance they polish them and with them they adorn their child who be delight with them and glory in them during their childhood but when they grow to year and see that none but child use such bauble they of their own accord without be bid by their parent lay them aside and would be as much ashamed to use them afterwards a child among u when they come to year be of their puppet and other toy i never saw a clear instance of the opposite impression that different custom make on people than i observe in the ambassador of the anemolians who come to amaurot when i be there a they come to treat of affair of great consequence the deputy from several town meet together to wait for their come the ambassador of the nation that lie near utopia know their custom and that fine clothes be in no esteem among them that silk be despise and gold be a badge of infamy use to come very modestly clothe but the anemolians lie more remote and have have little commerce with them understand that they be coarsely clothe and all in the same manner take it for grant that they have none of those fine thing among them of which they make no use and they be a vainglorious rather than a wise people resolve to set themselves out with so much pomp that they should look like god and strike the eye of the poor utopian with their splendour thus three ambassador make their entry with a hundred attendant all clothe in garment of different colour and the great part in silk the ambassador themselves who be of the nobility of their country be in clothofgold and adorn with massy chain earring and ring of gold their cap be cover with bracelet set full of pearl and other gem in a word they be set out with all those thing that among the utopian be either the badge of slavery the mark of infamy or the plaything of child it be not unpleasant to see on the one side how they look big when they compare their rich habit with the plain clothes of the utopian who be come out in great number to see them make their entry and on the other to observe how much they be mistake in the impression which they hop this pomp would have make on them it appear so ridiculous a show to all that have never stir out of their country and have not see the custom of other nation that though they pay some reverence to those that be the most meanly clothe a if they have be the ambassador yet when they saw the ambassador themselves so full of gold and chain they look upon them a slave and forbore to treat them with reverence you might have see the child who be grow big enough to despise their plaything and who have throw away their jewel call to their mother push them gently and cry out see that great fool that wear pearl and gem a if he be yet a child while their mother very innocently reply hold your peace this i believe be one of the ambassador fool other censure the fashion of their chain and observe that they be of no use for they be too slight to bind their slave who could easily break them and besides hung so loose about them that they think it easy to throw their away and so get from them but after the ambassador have stay a day among them and saw so vast a quantity of gold in their house which be a much despise by them a it be esteem in other nation and behold more gold and silver in the chain and fetter of one slave than all their ornament amount to their plume fell and they be ashamed of all that glory for which they have form value themselves and accordingly lay it aside a resolution that they immediately take when on their engaging in some free discourse with the utopian they discover their sense of such thing and their other custom the utopian wonder how any man should be so much take with the glare doubtful lustre of a jewel or a stone that can look up to a star or to the sun himself or how any should value himself because hi cloth be make of a finer thread for how fine soever that thread may be it be once no good than the fleece of a sheep and that sheep be a sheep still for all it wear it they wonder much to hear that gold which in itself be so useless a thing should be everywhere so much esteem that even man for whom it be make and by whom it have it value should yet be think of less value than this metal that a man of lead who have no more sense than a log of wood and be as bad a he be foolish should have many wise and good men to serve him only because he have a great heap of that metal and that if it should happen that by some accident or trick of law which sometimes produce a great change a chance itself all this wealth should pass from the master to the mean varlet of hi whole family he himself would very soon become one of hi servant a if he be a thing that belong to hi wealth and so be bind to follow it fortune but they much more admire and detest the folly of those who when they see a rich man though they neither owe him anything nor be in any sort dependent on hi bounty yet merely because he be rich give him little less than divine honour even though they know him to be so covetous and baseminded that notwithstanding all hi wealth he will not part with one farthing of it to them as long a he live these and such like notion have that people imbibe partly from their education be breed in a country whose custom and law be opposite to all such foolish maxim and partly from their learning and study for though there be but few in any town that be so wholly excuse from labour a to give themselves entirely up to their study these be only such person a discover from their childhood an extraordinary capacity and disposition for letter yet their child and a great part of the nation both men and woman be teach to spend those hour in which they be not oblige to work in reading and this they do through the whole progress of life they have all their learning in their own tongue which be both a copious and pleasant language and in which a man can fully express hi mind it run over a great tract of many country but it be not equally pure in all place they have never so much a heard of the name of any of those philosopher that be so famous in these part of the world before we go among them and yet they have make the same discovery a the greek both in music logic arithmetic and geometry but a they be almost in everything equal to the ancient philosopher so they far exceed our modern logician for they have never yet fall upon the barbarous nicety that our youth be force to learn in those trifle logical school that be among u they be so far from mind chimera and fantastical image make in the mind that none of them could comprehend what we mean when we talk to them of a man in the abstract a common to all men in particular so that though we speak of him a a thing that we could point at with our finger yet none of them could perceive him and yet distinct from every one a if he be some monstrous colossus or giant yet for all this ignorance of these empty notion they know astronomy and be perfectly acquaint with the motion of the heavenly body and have many instrument well contrive and divide by which they very accurately compute the course and position of the sun moon and star but for the cheat of divining by the star by their opposition or conjunction it have not so much a enter into their thought they have a particular sagacity found upon much observation in judging of the weather by which they know when they may look for rain wind or other alteration in the air but a to the philosophy of these thing the cause of the salt of the sea of it ebbing and flowing and of the original and nature both of the heaven and the earth they dispute of them partly a our ancient philosopher have do and partly upon some new hypothesis in which a they differ from them so they do not in all thing agree among themselves a to moral philosophy they have the same dispute among them a we have here they examine what be properly good both for the body and the mind and whether any outward thing can be call truly good or if that term belong only to the endowment of the soul they inquire likewise into the nature of virtue and pleasure but their chief dispute be concern the happiness of a man and wherein it consist whether in some one thing or in a great many they seem indeed more inclinable to that opinion that place if not the whole yet the chief part of a man happiness in pleasure and what may seem more strange they make use of argument even from religion notwithstanding it severity and roughness for the support of that opinion so indulgent to pleasure for they never dispute concern happiness without fetch some argument from the principle of religion as well a from natural reason since without the former they reckon that all our inquiry after happiness must be but conjectural and defective these be their religious principle that the soul of man be immortal and that god of hi goodness have design that it should be happy and that he have therefore appoint reward for good and virtuous action and punishment for vice to be distribute after this life though these principle of religion be convey down among them by tradition they think that even reason itself determine a man to believe and acknowledge them and freely confess that if these be take away no man would be so insensible a not to seek after pleasure by all possible mean lawful or unlawful use only this caution that a less pleasure might not stand in the way of a great and that no pleasure ought to be pursue that should draw a great deal of pain after it for they think it the mad thing in the world to pursue virtue that be a sour and difficult thing and not only to renounce the pleasure of life but willingly to undergo much pain and trouble if a man have no prospect of a reward and what reward can there be for one that have pass hi whole life not only without pleasure but in pain if there be nothing to be expect after death yet they do not place happiness in all sort of pleasure but only in those that in themselves be good and honest there be a party among them who place happiness in bare virtue other think that our nature be conduct by virtue to happiness a that which be the chief good of man they define virtue thus that it be a live accord to nature and think that we be make by god for that end they believe that a man then follow the dictate of nature when he pursue or avoids thing accord to the direction of reason they say that the first dictate of reason be the kindling in u a love and reverence for the divine majesty to whom we owe both all that we have and all that we can ever hope for in the next place reason direct u to keep our mind a free from passion and as cheerful a we can and that we should consider ourselves a bound by the tie of goodnature and humanity to use our utmost endeavour to help forward the happiness of all other person for there never be any man such a morose and severe pursuer of virtue such an enemy to pleasure that though he set hard rule for men to undergo much pain many watching and other rigor yet do not at the same time advise them to do all they could in order to relieve and ease the miserable and who do not represent gentleness and goodnature a amiable disposition and from thence they infer that if a man ought to advance the welfare and comfort of the rest of mankind there be no virtue more proper and peculiar to our nature than to ease the misery of other to free from trouble and anxiety in furnish them with the comfort of life in which pleasure consist nature much more vigorously lead them to do all this for himself a life of pleasure be either a real evil and in that case we ought not to assist other in their pursuit of it but on the contrary to keep them from it all we can a from that which be most hurtful and deadly or if it be a good thing so that we not only may but ought to help other to it why then ought not a man to begin with himself since no man can be more bound to look after the good of another than after hi own for nature can not direct u to be good and kind to other and yet at the same time to be unmerciful and cruel to ourselves thus a they define virtue to be live accord to nature so they imagine that nature prompt all people on to seek after pleasure a the end of all they do they also observe that in order to our support the pleasure of life nature incline u to enter into society for there be no man so much raise above the rest of mankind a to be the only favourite of nature who on the contrary seem to have place on a level all those that belong to the same species upon this they infer that no man ought to seek hi own convenience so eagerly a to prejudice other and therefore they think that not only all agreement between private person ought to be observe but likewise that all those law ought to be keep which either a good prince have publish in due form or to which a people that be neither oppressed with tyranny nor circumvent by fraud have consent for distribute those convenience of life which afford u all our pleasure they think it be an evidence of true wisdom for a man to pursue hi own advantage as far a the law allow it they account it piety to prefer the public good to one private concern but they think it unjust for a man to seek for pleasure by snatch another man pleasures from him and on the contrary they think it a sign of a gentle and good soul for a man to dispense with hi own advantage for the good of other and that by this mean a good man find as much pleasure one way a he part with another for a he may expect the like from other when he may come to need it so if that should fail him yet the sense of a good action and the reflection that he make on the love and gratitude of those whom he have so oblige give the mind more pleasure than the body could have find in that from which it have restrain itself they be also persuade that god will make up the loss of those small pleasure with a vast and endless joy of which religion easily convince a good soul thus upon an inquiry into the whole matter they reckon that all our action and even all our virtue terminate in pleasure a in our chief end and great happiness and they call every motion or state either of body or mind in which nature teach u to delight a pleasure thus they cautiously limit pleasure only to those appetite to which nature lead u for they say that nature lead u only to those delight to which reason as well a sense carry u and by which we neither injure any other person nor lose the possession of great pleasure and of such a draw no trouble after them but they look upon those delight which men by a foolish though common mistake call pleasure a if they could change a easily the nature of thing a the use of word a thing that greatly obstruct their real happiness instead of advance it because they so entirely posse the mind of those that be once captivate by them with a false notion of pleasure that there be no room leave for pleasure of a truer or purer kind there be many thing that in themselves have nothing that be truly delightful on the contrary they have a good deal of bitterness in them and yet from our perverse appetite after forbidden object be not only rank among the pleasure but be make even the great design of life among those who pursue these sophisticated pleasure they reckon such a i mention before who think themselves really the good for have fine clothes in which they think they be doubly mistake both in the opinion they have of their clothes and in that they have of themselves for if you consider the use of clothes why should a fine thread be think good than a coarse one and yet these men a if they have some real advantage beyond other and do not owe them wholly to their mistake look big seem to fancy themselves to be more valuable and imagine that a respect be due to them for the sake of a rich garment to which they would not have pretend if they have be more meanly clothe and even resent it a an affront if that respect be not pay them it be also a great folly to be take with outward mark of respect which signify nothing for what true or real pleasure can one man find in anothers stand bare or make leg to him will the bending another man knee give ease to yours and will the head be bare cure the madness of yours and yet it be wonderful to see how this false notion of pleasure bewitches many who delight themselves with the fancy of their nobility and be please with this conceit that they be descend from ancestor who have be hold for some succession rich and who have have great possession for this be all that make nobility at present yet they do not think themselves a whit the less noble though their immediate parent have leave none of this wealth to them or though they themselves have squander it away the utopian have no good opinion of those who be much take with gem and precious stone and who account it a degree of happiness next to a divine one if they can purchase one that be very extraordinary especially if it be of that sort of stone that be then in great request for the same sort be not at all time universally of the same value nor will men buy it unless it be dismount and take out of the gold the jeweller be then make to give good security and require solemnly to swear that the stone be true that by such an exact caution a false one might not be buy instead of a true though if you be to examine it your eye could find no difference between the counterfeit and that which be true so that they be all one to you as much a if you be blind or can it be think that they who heap up a useless mass of wealth not for any use that it be to bring them but merely to please themselves with the contemplation of it enjoy any true pleasure in it the delight they find be only a false shadow of joy those be no good whose error be somewhat different from the former and who hide it out of their fear of lose it for what other name can fit the hiding it in the earth or rather the restore it to it again it be thus cut off from be useful either to it owner or to the rest of mankind and yet the owner have hid it carefully be glad because he think he be now sure of it if it should be steal the owner though he might live perhaps ten year after the theft of which he know nothing would find no difference between hi have or lose it for both way it be equally useless to him among those foolish pursuer of pleasure they reckon all that delight in hunt in fowl or gaming of whose madness they have only hear for they have no such thing among them but they have ask u what sort of pleasure be it that men can find in throw the dice for if there be any pleasure in it they think the do it so often should give one a surfeit of it and what pleasure can one find in hear the barking and howling of dog which seem rather odious than pleasant sound nor can they comprehend the pleasure of see dog run after a hare more than of see one dog run after another for if the see them run be that which give the pleasure you have the same entertainment to the eye on both these occasion since that be the same in both case but if the pleasure lie in see the hare kill and tear by the dog this ought rather to stir pity that a weak harmless and fearful hare should be devour by strong fierce and cruel dog therefore all this business of hunting be among the utopian turn over to their butcher and those a have be already say be all slave and they look on hunting a one of the base part of a butcher work for they account it both more profitable and more decent to kill those beast that be more necessary and useful to mankind whereas the killing and tearing of so small and miserable an animal can only attract the huntsman with a false show of pleasure from which he can reap but small advantage they look on the desire of the bloodshed even of beast a a mark of a mind that be already corrupt with cruelty or that at least by too frequent return of so brutal a pleasure must degenerate into it thus though the rabble of mankind look upon these and on innumerable other thing of the same nature a pleasure the utopian on the contrary observing that there be nothing in them truly pleasant conclude that they be not to be reckon among pleasure for though these thing may create some tickling in the sens which seem to be a true notion of pleasure yet they imagine that this do not arise from the thing itself but from a deprave custom which may so vitiate a man taste that bitter thing may pass for sweet a woman with child think pitch or tallow taste sweeter than honey but a a man sense when corrupt either by a disease or some ill habit do not change the nature of other thing so neither can it change the nature of pleasure they reckon up several sort of pleasure which they call true one some belong to the body and other to the mind the pleasure of the mind lie in knowledge and in that delight which the contemplation of truth carry with it to which they add the joyful reflection on a wellspent life and the assured hope of a future happiness they divide the pleasure of the body into two sort the one be that which give our sens some real delight and be perform either by recruit nature and supply those part which fee the internal heat of life by eat and drinking or when nature be ease of any surcharge that oppress it when we be relieve from sudden pain or that which arise from satisfy the appetite which nature have wisely give to lead u to the propagation of the specie there be another kind of pleasure that arise neither from our receive what the body require nor it be relieve when overcharge and yet by a secret unseen virtue affect the sens raise the passion and strike the mind with generous impression this be the pleasure that arise from music another kind of bodily pleasure be that which result from an undisturbed and vigorous constitution of body when life and active spirit seem to actuate every part this lively health when entirely free from all mixture of pain of itself give an inward pleasure independent of all external object of delight and though this pleasure do not so powerfully affect u nor act so strongly on the sens a some of the other yet it may be esteem a the great of all pleasure and almost all the utopian reckon it the foundation and basis of all the other joy of life since this alone make the state of life easy and desirable and when this be want a man be really capable of no other pleasure they look upon freedom from pain if it do not rise from perfect health to be a state of stupidity rather than of pleasure this subject have be very narrowly canvass among them and it have be debate whether a firm and entire health could be call a pleasure or not some have think that there be no pleasure but what be excite by some sensible motion in the body but this opinion have be long ago exclude from among them so that now they almost universally agree that health be the great of all bodily pleasure and that a there be a pain in sickness which be a opposite in it nature to pleasure a sickness itself be to health so they hold that health be accompany with pleasure and if any should say that sickness be not really pain but that it only carry pain along with it they look upon that a a fetch of subtlety that do not much alter the matter it be all one in their opinion whether it be say that health be in itself a pleasure or that it beget a pleasure a fire give heat so it be grant that all those whose health be entire have a true pleasure in the enjoyment of it and they reason thus what be the pleasure of eat but that a man health which have be weaken do with the assistance of food drive away hunger and so recruit itself recover it former vigour and be thus refresh it find a pleasure in that conflict and if the conflict be pleasure the victory must yet breed a great pleasure except we fancy that it become stupid as soon a it have obtain that which it pursue and so neither know nor rejoices in it own welfare if it be say that health can not be felt they absolutely deny it for what man be in health that do not perceive it when he be awake is there any man that be so dull and stupid a not to acknowledge that he feel a delight in health and what be delight but another name for pleasure but of all pleasure they esteem those to be most valuable that lie in the mind the chief of which arise out of true virtue and the witness of a good conscience they account health the chief pleasure that belong to the body for they think that the pleasure of eating and drinking and all the other delight of sense be only so far desirable a they give or maintain health but they be not pleasant in themselves otherwise than a they resist those impression that our natural infirmity be still make upon u for a a wise man desire rather to avoid disease than to take physic and to be free from pain rather than to find ease by remedy so it be more desirable not to need this sort of pleasure than to be oblige to indulge it if any man imagine that there be a real happiness in these enjoyment he must then confess that he would be the happy of all men if he be to lead hi life in perpetual hunger thirst and itching and by consequence in perpetual eating drinking and scratch himself which any one may easily see would be not only a base but a miserable state of a life these be indeed the low of pleasure and the least pure for we can never relish them but when they be mixed with the contrary pain the pain of hunger must give u the pleasure of eating and here the pain outbalance the pleasure and a the pain be more vehement so it last much long for a it begin before the pleasure so it do not cease but with the pleasure that extinguish it and both expire together they think therefore none of those pleasure be to be value any further than a they be necessary yet they rejoice in them and with due gratitude acknowledge the tenderness of the great author of nature who have plant in u appetite by which those thing that be necessary for our preservation be likewise make pleasant to u for how miserable a thing would life be if those daily disease of hunger and thirst be to be carry off by such bitter drug a we must use for those disease that return seldom upon u and thus these pleasant as well a proper gift of nature maintain the strength and the sprightliness of our body they also entertain themselves with the other delight let in at their eye their ear and their nostril a the pleasant relish and seasoning of life which nature seem to have mark out peculiarly for man since no other sort of animal contemplate the figure and beauty of the universe nor be delight with smell any far than a they distinguish meat by them nor do they apprehend the concord or discord of sound yet in all pleasure whatsoever they take care that a less joy do not hinder a great and that pleasure may never breed pain which they think always follow dishonest pleasure but they think it madness for a man to wear out the beauty of hi face or the force of hi natural strength to corrupt the sprightliness of hi body by sloth and laziness or to waste it by fast that it be madness to weaken the strength of hi constitution and reject the other delight of life unless by renounce hi own satisfaction he can either serve the public or promote the happiness of other for which he expect a great recompense from god so that they look on such a course of life a the mark of a mind that be both cruel to itself and ungrateful to the author of nature a if we would not be behold to him for hi favour and therefore reject all hi blessing a one who should afflict himself for the empty shadow of virtue or for no good end than to render himself capable of bear those misfortune which possibly will never happen this be their notion of virtue and of pleasure they think that no man reason can carry him to a truer idea of them unless some discovery from heaven should inspire him with sublimer notion i have not now the leisure to examine whether they think right or wrong in this matter nor do i judge it necessary for i have only undertaken to give you an account of their constitution but not to defend all their principle i be sure that whatever may be say of their notion there be not in the whole world either a good people or a happy governmenttheir body be vigorous and lively and though they be but of a middle stature and have neither the fruitfullest soil nor the pure air in the world yet they fortify themselves so well by their temperate course of life against the unhealthiness of their air and by their industry they so cultivate their soil that there be nowhere to be see a great increase both of corn and cattle nor be there anywhere healthy men and freer from disease for one may there see reduce to practice not only all the art that the husbandman employ in manure and improve an ill soil but whole wood pluck up by the root and in other place new one plant where there be none before their principal motive for this be the convenience of carriage that their timber may be either near their town or grow on the bank of the sea or of some river so a to be float to them for it be a harder work to carry wood at any distance over land than corn the people be industrious apt to learn as well a cheerful and pleasant and none can endure more labour when it be necessary but except in that case they love their ease they be unwearied pursuer of knowledge for when we have give them some hint of the learning and discipline of the greek concern whom we only instruct them for we know that there be nothing among the roman except their historian and their poet that they would value much it be strange to see how eagerly they be set on learn that language we begin to read a little of it to them rather in compliance with their importunity than out of any hope of their reaping from it any great advantage but after a very short trial we find they make such progress that we saw our labour be like to be more successful than we could have expect they learn to write their character and to pronounce their language so exactly have so quick an apprehension they remember it so faithfully and become so ready and correct in the use of it that it would have look like a miracle if the great part of those whom we teach have not be men both of extraordinary capacity and of a fit age for instruction they be for the great part choose from among their learn men by their chief council though some study it of their own accord in three year time they become master of the whole language so that they read the best of the greek author very exactly i be indeed apt to think that they learn that language the more easily from it have some relation to their own i believe that they be a colony of the greek for though their language come nearer the persian yet they retain many name both for their town and magistrate that be of greek derivation i happen to carry a great many book with me instead of merchandise when i sail my fourth voyage for i be so far from think of soon come back that i rather think never to have return at all and i give them all my book among which be many of plato and some of aristotle work i have also theophrastus on plant which to my great regret be imperfect for have lay it carelessly by while we be at sea a monkey have seize upon it and in many place tear out the leaf they have no book of grammar but lascar for i do not carry theodorus with me nor have they any dictionary but hesichius and dioscerides they esteem plutarch highly and be much take with lucians wit and with hi pleasant way of writing a for the poet they have aristophanes homer euripides and sophocles of alduss edition and for historian thucydides herodotus and herodian one of my companion thricius apinatus happen to carry with him some of hippocrates work and galen microtechne which they hold in great estimation for though there be no nation in the world that need physic so little a they do yet there be not any that honour it so much they reckon the knowledge of it one of the pleasant and most profitable part of philosophy by which a they search into the secret of nature so they not only find this study highly agreeable but think that such inquiry be very acceptable to the author of nature and imagine that a he like the inventor of curious engine amongst mankind have expose this great machine of the universe to the view of the only creature capable of contemplate it so an exact and curious observer who admire hi workmanship be much more acceptable to him than one of the herd who like a beast incapable of reason look on this glorious scene with the eye of a dull and unconcerned spectator the mind of the utopian when fence with a love for learn be very ingenious in discover all such art a be necessary to carry it to perfection two thing they owe to u the manufacture of paper and the art of print yet they be not so entirely indebted to u for these discovery but that a great part of the invention be their own we show them some book print by aldus we explain to them the way of make paper and the mystery of print but a we have never practise these art we describe them in a crude and superficial manner they seize the hint we give them and though at first they could not arrive at perfection yet by make many essay they at last find out and correct all their error and conquer every difficulty before this they only write on parchment on reed or on the bark of tree but now they have establish the manufacture of paper and set up printing press so that if they have but a good number of greek author they would be quickly supply with many copy of them at present though they have no more than those i have mention yet by several impression they have multiply them into many thousand if any man be to go among them that have some extraordinary talent or that by much travelling have observe the custom of many nation which make u to be so well receive he would receive a hearty welcome for they be very desirous to know the state of the whole world very few go among them on the account of traffic for what can a man carry to them but iron or gold or silver which merchant desire rather to export than import to a strange country and a for their exportation they think it good to manage that themselves than to leave it to foreigner for by this mean a they understand the state of the neighbouring country well so they keep up the art of navigation which can not be maintain but by much practice they do not make slave of prisoner of war except those that be take in battle nor of the son of their slave nor of those of other nation the slave among them be only such a be condemn to that state of life for the commission of some crime or which be more common such a their merchant find condemn to die in those part to which they trade whom they sometimes redeem at low rate and in other place have them for nothing they be keep at perpetual labour and be always chain but with this difference that their own native be treat much bad than other they be consider a more profligate than the rest and since they could not be restrain by the advantage of so excellent an education be judge worthy of harder usage another sort of slave be the poor of the neighbouring country who offer of their own accord to come and serve them they treat these good and use them in all other respect as well a their own countryman except their imposing more labour upon them which be no hard task to those that have be accustom to it and if any of these have a mind to go back to their own country which indeed fall out but seldom a they do not force them to stay so they do not send them away emptyhanded i have already tell you with what care they look after their sick so that nothing be leave undone that can contribute either to their case or health and for those who be take with fixed and incurable disease they use all possible way to cherish them and to make their life as comfortable a possible they visit them often and take great pain to make their time pass off easily but when any be take with a torturing and linger pain so that there be no hope either of recovery or ease the priest and magistrates come and exhort them that since they be now unable to go on with the business of life be become a burden to themselves and to all about them and they have really outlive themselves they should no longer nourish such a rooted distemper but choose rather to die since they can not live but in much misery be assure that if they thus deliver themselves from torture or be willing that other should do it they shall be happy after death since by their act thus they lose none of the pleasure but only the trouble of life they think they behave not only reasonably but in a manner consistent with religion and piety because they follow the advice give them by their priest who be the expounder of the will of god such a be work on by these persuasion either starve themselves of their own accord or take opium and by that mean die without pain but no man be force on this way of end hi life and if they can not be persuade to it this do not induce them to fail in their attendance and care of them but a they believe that a voluntary death when it be choose upon such an authority be very honourable so if any man take away hi own life without the approbation of the priest and the senate they give him none of the honour of a decent funeral but throw hi body into a ditch their woman be not marry before eighteen nor their men before twoandtwenty and if any of them run into forbidden embrace before marriage they be severely punish and the privilege of marriage be deny them unless they can obtain a special warrant from the prince such disorder cast a great reproach upon the master and mistress of the family in which they happen for it be suppose that they have fail in their duty the reason of punish this so severely be because they think that if they be not strictly restrain from all vagrant appetite very few would engage in a state in which they venture the quiet of their whole life by be confine to one person and be oblige to endure all the inconvenience with which it be accompany in choose their wife they use a method that would appear to u very absurd and ridiculous but it be constantly observe among them and be account perfectly consistent with wisdom before marriage some grave matron present the bride naked whether she be a virgin or a widow to the bridegroom and after that some grave man present the bridegroom naked to the bride we indeed both laugh at this and condemn it a very indecent but they on the other hand wonder at the folly of the men of all other nation who if they be but to buy a horse of a small value be so cautious that they will see every part of him and take off both hi saddle and all hi other tackle that there may be no secret ulcer hid under any of them and that yet in the choice of a wife on which depend the happiness or unhappiness of the rest of hi life a man should venture upon trust and only see about a handsbreadth of the face all the rest of the body be cover under which may lie hide what may be contagious as well a loathsome all men be not so wise a to choose a woman only for her good quality and even wise men consider the body a that which add not a little to the mind and it be certain there may be some such deformity cover with clothes a may totally alienate a man from hi wife when it be too late to part with her if such a thing be discover after marriage a man have no remedy but patience they therefore think it be reasonable that there should be good provision make against such mischievous fraud there be so much the more reason for them to make a regulation in this matter because they be the only people of those part that neither allow of polygamy nor of divorce except in the case of adultery or insufferable perverseness for in these case the senate dissolve the marriage and grant the injured person leave to marry again but the guilty be make infamous and be never allow the privilege of a second marriage none be suffer to put away their wife against their will from any great calamity that may have fall on their person for they look on it a the height of cruelty and treachery to abandon either of the married person when they need most the tender care of their consort and that chiefly in the case of old age which a it carry many disease along with it so it be a disease of itself but it frequently fall out that when a married couple do not well agree they by mutual consent separate and find out other person with whom they hope they may live more happily yet this be not do without obtain leave of the senate which never admit of a divorce but upon a strict inquiry make both by the senator and their wife into the ground upon which it be desire and even when they be satisfied concern the reason of it they go on but slowly for they imagine that too great easiness in grant leave for new marriage would very much shake the kindness of married people they punish severely those that defile the marriage bed if both party be marry they be divorce and the injured person may marry one another or whom they please but the adulterer and the adulteress be condemn to slavery yet if either of the injured person can not shake off the love of the marry person they may live with them still in that state but they must follow them to that labour to which the slave be condemn and sometimes the repentance of the condemn together with the unshaken kindness of the innocent and injured person have prevail so far with the prince that he have take off the sentence but those that relapse after they be once pardon be punish with death their law do not determine the punishment for other crime but that be leave to the senate to temper it accord to the circumstance of the fact husband have power to correct their wife and parent to chastise their child unless the fault be so great that a public punishment be think necessary for strike terror into other for the most part slavery be the punishment even of the great crime for a that be no less terrible to the criminal themselves than death so they think the preserve them in a state of servitude be more for the interest of the commonwealth than kill them since a their labour be a great benefit to the public than their death could be so the sight of their misery be a more lasting terror to other men than that which would be give by their death if their slave rebel and will not bear their yoke and submit to the labour that be enjoin them they be treat a wild beast that can not be keep in order neither by a prison nor by their chain and be at last put to death but those who bear their punishment patiently and be so much wrought on by that pressure that lie so hard on them that it appear they be really more troubled for the crime they have commit than for the misery they suffer be not out of hope but that at last either the prince will by hi prerogative or the people by their intercession restore them again to their liberty or at least very much mitigate their slavery he that tempt a married woman to adultery be no less severely punish than he that commit it for they believe that a deliberate design to commit a crime be equal to the fact itself since it not take effect do not make the person that miscarry in hi attempt at all the less guilty they take great pleasure in fool and a it be think a base and unbecoming thing to use them ill so they do not think it amiss for people to divert themselves with their folly and in their opinion this be a great advantage to the fool themselves for if men be so sullen and severe a not at all to please themselves with their ridiculous behaviour and foolish saying which be all that they can do to recommend themselves to other it could not be expect that they would be so well provide for nor so tenderly use a they must otherwise be if any man should reproach another for hi be misshaped or imperfect in any part of hi body it would not at all be think a reflection on the person so treated but it would be account scandalous in him that have upbraid another with what he could not help it be think a sign of a sluggish and sordid mind not to preserve carefully one natural beauty but it be likewise infamous among them to use paint they all see that no beauty recommend a wife so much to her husband a the probity of her life and her obedience for a some few be catch and hold only by beauty so all be attract by the other excellence which charm all the world a they fright men from commit crime by punishment so they invite them to the love of virtue by public honour therefore they erect statue to the memory of such worthy men a have deserve well of their country and set these in their marketplace both to perpetuate the remembrance of their action and to be an incitement to their posterity to follow their example if any man aspire to any office he be sure never to compass it they all live easily together for none of the magistrate be either insolent or cruel to the people they affect rather to be call father and by be really so they well deserve the name and the people pay them all the mark of honour the more freely because none be exact from them the prince himself have no distinction either of garment or of a crown but be only distinguish by a sheaf of corn carry before him a the high priest be also know by hi be precede by a person carry a wax light they have but few law and such be their constitution that they need not many they very much condemn other nation whose law together with the commentary on them swell up to so many volume for they think it an unreasonable thing to oblige men to obey a body of law that be both of such a bulk and so dark a not to be read and understand by every one of the subject they have no lawyer among them for they consider them a a sort of people whose profession it be to disguise matter and to wrest the law and therefore they think it be much good that every man should plead hi own cause and trust it to the judge a in other place the client trust it to a counsellor by this mean they both cut off many delay and find out truth more certainly for after the party have lay open the merit of the cause without those artifice which lawyer be apt to suggest the judge examine the whole matter and support the simplicity of such wellmeaning person whom otherwise crafty men would be sure to run down and thus they avoid those evil which appear very remarkably among all those nation that labour under a vast load of law every one of them be skilled in their law for a it be a very short study so the plain meaning of which word be capable be always the sense of their law and they argue thus all law be promulgate for this end that every man may know hi duty and therefore the plainest and most obvious sense of the word be that which ought to be put upon them since a more refined exposition can not be easily comprehend and would only serve to make the law become useless to the great part of mankind and especially to those who need most the direction of them for it be all one not to make a law at all or to couch it in such term that without a quick apprehension and much study a man can not find out the true meaning of it since the generality of mankind be both so dull and so much employ in their several trade that they have neither the leisure nor the capacity requisite for such an inquiry some of their neighbour who be master of their own liberty have long ago by the assistance of the utopian shake off the yoke of tyranny and be much take with those virtue which they observe among them have come to desire that they would send magistrate to govern them some change them every year and other every five year at the end of their governmentthey bring them back to utopia with great expression of honour and esteem and carry away other to govern in their stead in this they seem to have fall upon a very good expedient for their own happiness and safety for since the good or ill condition of a nation depend so much upon their magistrate they could not have make a good choice than by pitch on men whom no advantage can bias for wealth be of no use to them since they must so soon go back to their own country and they be stranger among them be not engage in any of their heat or animosity and it be certain that when public judicatory be sway either by avarice or partial affection there must follow a dissolution of justice the chief sinew of society the utopian call those nation that come and ask magistrate from them neighbour but those to whom they have be of more particular service friend and a all other nation be perpetually either make league or break them they never enter into an alliance with any state they think league be useless thing and believe that if the common tie of humanity do not knit men together the faith of promise will have no great effect and they be the more confirmed in this by what they see among the nation round about them who be no strict observer of league and treaties we know how religiously they be observe in europe more particularly where the christian doctrine be receive among whom they be sacred and inviolable which be partly owe to the justice and goodness of the prince themselves and partly to the reverence they pay to the pope who a they be the most religious observer of their own promise so they exhort all other prince to perform theirs and when fainter method do not prevail they compel them to it by the severity of the pastoral censure and think that it would be the most indecent thing possible if men who be particularly distinguish by the title of the faithful should not religiously keep the faith of their treaty but in that newfound world which be not more distant from u in situation than the people be in their manner and course of life there be no trust to league even though they be make with all the pomp of the most sacred ceremony on the contrary they be on this account the sooner break some slight pretence be find in the word of the treaty which be purposely couch in such ambiguous term that they can never be so strictly bind but they will always find some loophole to escape at and thus they break both their league and their faith and this be do with such impudence that those very men who value themselves on have suggest these expedient to their prince would with a haughty scorn declaim against such craft or to speak plainer such fraud and deceit if they find private men make use of it in their bargain and would readily say that they deserve to be hang by this mean it be that all sort of justice pass in the world for a lowspirited and vulgar virtue far below the dignity of royal greatness or at least there be set up two sort of justice the one be mean and creep on the ground and therefore become none but the low part of mankind and so must be keep in severely by many restraint that it may not break out beyond the bound that be set to it the other be the peculiar virtue of prince which a it be more majestic than that which become the rabble so take a freer compass and thus lawful and unlawful be only measure by pleasure and interest these practice of the prince that lie about utopia who make so little account of their faith seem to be the reason that determine them to engage in no confederacy perhaps they would change their mind if they live among u but yet though treaty be more religiously observe they would still dislike the custom of make them since the world have take up a false maxim upon it a if there be no tie of nature unite one nation to another only separate perhaps by a mountain or a river and that all be bear in a state of hostility and so might lawfully do all that mischief to their neighbour against which there be no provision make by treaty and that when treaty be make they do not cut off the enmity or restrain the licence of prey upon each other if by the unskilfulness of word them there be not effectual proviso make against them they on the other hand judge that no man be to be esteem our enemy that have never injure u and that the partnership of human nature be instead of a league and that kindness and good nature unite men more effectually and with great strength than any agreement whatsoever since thereby the engagement of men heart become strong than the bond and obligation of word they detest war a a very brutal thing and which to the reproach of human nature be more practised by men than by any sort of beast they in opposition to the sentiment of almost all other nation think that there be nothing more inglorious than that glory that be gain by war and therefore though they accustom themselves daily to military exercise and the discipline of war in which not only their men but their woman likewise be train up that in case of necessity they may not be quite useless yet they do not rashly engage in war unless it be either to defend themselves or their friend from any unjust aggressor or out of good nature or in compassion assist an oppressed nation in shake off the yoke of tyranny they indeed help their friend not only in defensive but also in offensive war but they never do that unless they have be consult before the breach be make and be satisfy with the ground on which they go they have find that all demand of reparation be reject so that a war be unavoidable this they think to be not only just when one neighbour make an inroad on another by public order and carry away the spoil but when the merchant of one country be oppress in another either under pretence of some unjust law or by the perverse wresting of good one this they count a juster cause of war than the other because those injury be do under some colour of law this be the only ground of that war in which they engage with the nephelogetes against the aleopolitanes a little before our time for the merchant of the former have a they think meet with great injustice among the latter which whether it be in itself right or wrong drew on a terrible war in which many of their neighbour be engage and their keenness in carry it on be support by their strength in maintain it it not only shake some very flourishing state and very much afflict other but after a series of much mischief end in the entire conquest and slavery of the aleopolitanes who though before the war they be in all respect much superior to the nephelogetes be yet subdue but though the utopian have assist them in the war yet they pretend to no share of the spoil but though they so vigorously assist their friend in obtain reparation for the injury they have receive in affair of this nature yet if any such fraud be commit against themselves provide no violence be do to their person they would only on their be refuse satisfaction forbear trading with such a people this be not because they consider their neighbour more than their own citizen but since their neighbour trade every one upon hi own stock fraud be a more sensible injury to them than it be to the utopian among whom the public in such a case only suffer a they expect no thing in return for the merchandise they export but that in which they so much abound and be of little use to them the loss do not much affect them they think therefore it would be too severe to revenge a loss attend with so little inconvenience either to their life or their subsistence with the death of many person but if any of their people be either kill or wound wrongfully whether it be do by public authority or only by private men as soon a they hear of it they send ambassador and demand that the guilty person may be deliver up to them and if that be deny they declare war but if it be comply with the offender be condemn either to death or slavery they would be both troubled and ashamed of a bloody victory over their enemy and think it would be a foolish a purchase a to buy the most valuable good at too high a rate and in no victory do they glory so much a in that which be gain by dexterity and good conduct without bloodshed in such case they appoint public triumph and erect trophy to the honour of those who have succeed for then do they reckon that a man act suitably to hi nature when he conquer hi enemy in such a way a that no other creature but a man could be capable of and that be by the strength of hi understanding bear lion boars wolf and dog and all other animal employ their bodily force one against another in which a many of them be superior to men both in strength and fierceness so they be all subdue by hi reason and understand the only design of the utopian in war be to obtain that by force which if it have be grant them in time would have prevent the war or if that can not be do to take so severe a revenge on those that have injure them that they may be terrify from do the like for the time to come by these end they measure all their design and manage them so that it be visible that the appetite of fame or vainglory do not work so much on there a a just care of their own security as soon a they declare war they take care to have a great many schedule that be seal with their common seal affix in the most conspicuous place of their enemy country this be carry secretly and do in many place all at once in these they promise great reward to such a shall kill the prince and lesser in proportion to such a shall kill any other person who be those on whom next to the prince himself they cast the chief balance of the war and they double the sum to him that instead of kill the person so mark out shall take him alive and put him in their hand they offer not only indemnity but reward to such of the person themselves that be so marked if they will act against their countryman by this mean those that be name in their schedule become not only distrustful of their fellowcitizens but be jealous of one another and be much distract by fear and danger for it have often fall out that many of them and even the prince himself have be betray by those in whom they have trust most for the reward that the utopian offer be so immeasurably great that there be no sort of crime to which men can not be draw by them they consider the risk that those run who undertake such service and offer a recompense proportion to the danger not only a vast deal of gold but great revenue in land that lie among other nation that be their friend where they may go and enjoy them very securely and they observe the promise they make of their kind most religiously they very much approve of this way of corrupt their enemy though it appear to other to be base and cruel but they look on it a a wise course to make an end of what would be otherwise a long war without so much a hazard one battle to decide it they think it likewise an act of mercy and love to mankind to prevent the great slaughter of those that must otherwise be kill in the progress of the war both on their own side and on that of their enemy by the death of a few that be most guilty and that in so do they be kind even to their enemy and pity them no less than their own people a know that the great part of them do not engage in the war of their own accord but be drive into it by the passion of their prince if this method do not succeed with them then they sow seed of contention among their enemy and animate the prince brother or some of the nobility to aspire to the crown if they can not disunite them by domestic broil then they engage their neighbour against them and make them set on foot some old pretension which be never want to prince when they have occasion for them these they plentifully supply with money though but very sparingly with any auxiliary troop for they be so tender of their own people that they would not willingly exchange one of them even with the prince of their enemy country but a they keep their gold and silver only for such an occasion so when that offer itself they easily part with it since it would be no convenience to them though they should reserve nothing of it to themselves for besides the wealth that they have among them at home they have a vast treasure abroad many nation round about them be deep in their debt so that they hire soldier from all place for carry on their war but chiefly from the zapolets who live five hundred mile east of utopia they be a rude wild and fierce nation who delight in the wood and rock among which they be bear and breed up they be harden both against heat cold and labour and know nothing of the delicacy of life they do not apply themselves to agriculture nor do they care either for their house or their clothes cattle be all that they look after and for the great part they live either by hunt or upon rapine and be make a it be only for war they watch all opportunity of engage in it and very readily embrace such a be offer them great number of them will frequently go out and offer themselves for a very low pay to serve any that will employ them they know none of the art of life but those that lead to the take it away they serve those that hire them both with much courage and great fidelity but will not engage to serve for any determined time and agree upon such term that the next day they may go over to the enemy of those whom they serve if they offer them a great encouragement and will perhaps return to them the day after that upon a high advance of their pay there be few war in which they make not a considerable part of the army of both side so it often fall out that they who be relate and be hire in the same country and so have live long and familiarly together forget both their relation and former friendship kill one another upon no other consideration than that of be hire to it for a little money by prince of different interest and such a regard have they for money that they be easily work on by the difference of one penny a day to change side so entirely do their avarice influence them and yet this money which they value so highly be of little use to them for what they purchase thus with their blood they quickly waste on luxury which among them be but of a poor and miserable form this nation serve the utopian against all people whatsoever for they pay high than any other the utopian hold this for a maxim that a they seek out the best sort of men for their own use at home so they make use of this bad sort of men for the consumption of war and therefore they hire them with the offer of vast reward to expose themselves to all sort of hazard out of which the great part never return to claim their promise yet they make them good most religiously to such a escape this animate them to adventure again whenever there be occasion for it for the utopian be not at all trouble how many of these happen to be kill and reckon it a service do to mankind if they could be a mean to deliver the world from such a lewd and vicious sort of people that seem to have run together a to the drain of human nature next to these they be serve in their war with those upon whose account they undertake them and with the auxiliary troop of their other friend to whom they join a few of their own people and send some man of eminent and approve virtue to command in chief there be two sent with him who during hi command be but private men but the first be to succeed him if he should happen to be either kill or take and in case of the like misfortune to him the third come in hi place and thus they provide against all event that such accident a may befall their general may not endanger their army when they draw out troop of their own people they take such out of every city a freely offer themselves for none be force to go against their will since they think that if any man be press that want courage he will not only act faintly but by hi cowardice dishearten other but if an invasion be make on their country they make use of such men if they have good body though they be not brave and either put them aboard their ship or place them on the wall of their town that be so post they may find no opportunity of fly away and thus either shame the heat of action or the impossibility of fly bear down their cowardice they often make a virtue of necessity and behave themselves well because nothing els be leave them but a they force no man to go into any foreign war against hi will so they do not hinder those woman who be willing to go along with their husband on the contrary they encourage and praise them and they stand often next their husband in the front of the army they also place together those who be relate parent and child kindred and those that be mutually ally near one another that those whom nature have inspire with the great zeal for assist one another may be the near and readiest to do it and it be matter of great reproach if husband or wife survive one another or if a child survive hi parent and therefore when they come to be engage in action they continue to fight to the last man if their enemy stand before them and a they use all prudent method to avoid the endanger their own men and if it be possible let all the action and danger fall upon the troop that they hire so if it become necessary for themselves to engage they then charge with as much courage a they avoid it before with prudence nor be it a fierce charge at first but it increase by degree and a they continue in action they grow more obstinate and press harder upon the enemy insomuch that they will much sooner die than give ground for the certainty that their child will be well look after when they be dead free them from all that anxiety concern them which often master men of great courage and thus they be animate by a noble and invincible resolution their skill in military affair increase their courage and the wise sentiment which accord to the law of their country be instill into them in their education give additional vigour to their mind for a they do not undervalue life so as prodigally to throw it away they be not so indecently fond of it a to preserve it by base and unbecoming method in the great heat of action the bravest of their youth who have devote themselves to that service single out the general of their enemy set on him either openly or by ambuscade pursue him everywhere and when spent and weary out be relieve by other who never give over the pursuit either attack him with close weapon when they can get near him or with those which wind at a distance when other get in between them so that unless he secure himself by flight they seldom fail at last to kill or to take him prisoner when they have obtain a victory they kill as few a possible and be much more bent on take many prisoner than on kill those that fly before them nor do they ever let their men so loose in the pursuit of their enemy a not to retain an entire body still in order so that if they have be force to engage the last of their battalion before they could gain the day they will rather let their enemy all escape than pursue them when their own army be in disorder remember well what have often fall out to themselves that when the main body of their army have be quite defeat and break when their enemy imagine the victory obtain have let themselves loose into an irregular pursuit a few of them that lay for a reserve wait a fit opportunity have fall on them in their chase and when straggle in disorder and apprehensive of no danger but count the day their own have turn the whole action and wrest out of their hand a victory that seem certain and undoubted while the vanquished have suddenly become victorious it be hard to tell whether they be more dexterous in lay or avoid ambush they sometimes seem to fly when it be far from their thought and when they intend to give ground they do it so that it be very hard to find out their design if they see they be ill post or be like to be overpower by number they then either march off in the night with great silence or by some stratagem delude their enemy if they retire in the daytime they do it in such order that it be no less dangerous to fall upon them in a retreat than in a march they fortify their camp with a deep and large trench and throw up the earth that be dig out of it for a wall nor do they employ only their slave in this but the whole army work at it except those that be then upon the guard so that when so many hand be at work a great line and a strong fortification be finish in so short a time that it be scarce credible their armour be very strong for defence and yet be not so heavy a to make them uneasy in their march they can even swim with it all that be train up to war practise swim both horse and foot make great use of arrow and be very expert they have no sword but fight with a poleaxe that be both sharp and heavy by which they thrust or strike down an enemy they be very good at find out warlike machine and disguise them so well that the enemy do not perceive them till he feel the use of them so that he can not prepare such a defence as would render them useless the chief consideration have in the make them be that they may be easily carry and manage if they agree to a truce they observe it so religiously that no provocation will make them break it they never lay their enemy country waste nor burn their corn and even in their march they take all possible care that neither horse nor foot may tread it down for they do not know but that they may have use for it themselves they hurt no man whom they find disarmed unless he be a spy when a town be surrender to them they take it into their protection and when they carry a place by storm they never plunder it but put those only to the sword that oppose the rendering of it up and make the rest of the garrison slave but for the other inhabitant they do them no hurt and if any of them have advise a surrender they give them good reward out of the estate of those that they condemn and distribute the rest among their auxiliary troop but they themselves take no share of the spoil when a war be end they do not oblige their friend to reimburse their expense but they obtain them of the conquered either in money which they keep for the next occasion or in land out of which a constant revenue be to be pay them by many increase the revenue which they draw out from several country on such occasion be now rise to above 700000 ducat a year they send some of their own people to receive these revenue who have order to live magnificently and like prince by which mean they consume much of it upon the place and either bring over the rest to utopia or lend it to that nation in which it lie this they most commonly do unless some great occasion which fall out but very seldom should oblige them to call for it all it be out of these land that they assign reward to such a they encourage to adventure on desperate attempt if any prince that engage in war with them be make preparation for invade their country they prevent him and make hi country the seat of the war for they do not willingly suffer any war to break in upon their island and if that should happen they would only defend themselves by their own people but would not call for auxiliary troop to their assistance there be several sort of religion not only in different part of the island but even in every town some worship the sun other the moon or one of the planet some worship such men a have be eminent in former time for virtue or glory not only a ordinary deity but a the supreme god yet the great and wise sort of them worship none of these but adore one eternal invisible infinite and incomprehensible deity a a being that be far above all our apprehension that be spread over the whole universe not by hi bulk but by hi power and virtue him they call the father of all and acknowledge that the beginning the increase the progress the vicissitude and the end of all thing come only from him nor do they offer divine honour to any but to him alone and indeed though they differ concern other thing yet all agree in this that they think there be one supreme being that make and govern the world whom they call in the language of their country mithra they differ in this that one think the god whom he worship be this supreme being and another think that hi idol be that god but they all agree in one principle that whoever be this supreme being he be also that great essence to whose glory and majesty all honour be ascribe by the consent of all nation by degree they fall off from the various superstition that be among them and grow up to that one religion that be the best and most in request and there be no doubt to be make but that all the other have vanish long ago if some of those who advise them to lay aside their superstition have not meet with some unhappy accident which be consider a inflict by heaven make them afraid that the god whose worship have like to have be abandon have interpose and revenge themselves on those who despise their authority after they have hear from u an account of the doctrine the course of life and the miracle of christ and of the wonderful constancy of so many martyr whose blood so willingly offer up by them be the chief occasion of spread their religion over a vast number of nation it be not to be imagine how inclined they be to receive it i shall not determine whether this proceed from any secret inspiration of god or whether it be because it seem so favourable to that community of good which be an opinion so particular as well a so dear to them since they perceive that christ and hi follower live by that rule and that it be still keep up in some community among the sincere sort of christian from whichsoever of these motif it might be true it be that many of them come over to our religion and be initiate into it by baptism but a two of our number be dead so none of the four that survive be in priest order we therefore could only baptise them so that to our great regret they could not partake of the other sacrament that can only be administer by priest but they be instruct concern them and long most vehemently for them they have have great dispute among themselves whether one chosen by them to be a priest would not be thereby qualify to do all the thing that belong to that character even though he have no authority derive from the pope and they seem to be resolve to choose some for that employment but they have not do it when i leave them those among them that have not receive our religion do not fright any from it and use none ill that go over to it so that all the while i be there one man be only punish on this occasion he be newly baptise do notwithstanding all that we could say to the contrary dispute publicly concern the christian religion with more zeal than discretion and with so much heat that he not only preferred our worship to theirs but condemn all their rite a profane and cry out against all that adhere to them a impious and sacrilegious person that be to be damn to everlasting burning upon hi have frequently preach in this manner he be seize and after trial he be condemn to banishment not for have disparage their religion but for hi inflame the people to sedition for this be one of their most ancient law that no man ought to be punish for hi religion at the first constitution of their governmentutopus have understood that before hi come among them the old inhabitant have be engage in great quarrel concern religion by which they be so divide among themselves that he find it an easy thing to conquer them since instead of unite their force against him every different party in religion fight by themselves after he have subdue them he make a law that every man might be of what religion he please and might endeavour to draw other to it by the force of argument and by amicable and modest way but without bitterness against those of other opinion but that he ought to use no other force but that of persuasion and be neither to mix with it reproach nor violence and such a do otherwise be to be condemn to banishment or slavery this law be make by utopus not only for preserve the public peace which he saw suffer much by daily contention and irreconcilable heat but because he think the interest of religion itself require it he judge it not fit to determine anything rashly and seem to doubt whether those different form of religion might not all come from god who might inspire man in a different manner and be please with this variety he therefore think it indecent and foolish for any man to threaten and terrify another to make him believe what do not appear to him to be true and suppose that only one religion be really true and the rest false he imagine that the native force of truth would at last break forth and shine bright if support only by the strength of argument and attend to with a gentle and unprejudiced mind while on the other hand if such debate be carry on with violence and tumult a the most wicked be always the most obstinate so the best and most holy religion might be choke with superstition a corn be with briar and thorn he therefore leave men wholly to their liberty that they might be free to believe a they should see cause only he make a solemn and severe law against such a should so far degenerate from the dignity of human nature a to think that our soul die with our body or that the world be govern by chance without a wise overrule providence for they all formerly believe that there be a state of reward and punishment to the good and bad after this life and they now look on those that think otherwise a scarce fit to be count men since they degrade so noble a be a the soul and reckon it no good than a beast thus they be far from look on such men a fit for human society or to be citizen of a wellordered commonwealth since a man of such principle must need as oft a he dare do it despise all their law and custom for there be no doubt to be make that a man who be afraid of nothing but the law and apprehend nothing after death will not scruple to break through all the law of hi country either by fraud or force when by this mean he may satisfy hi appetite they never raise any that hold these maxim either to honour or office nor employ them in any public trust but despise them a men of base and sordid mind yet they do not punish them because they lay this down a a maxim that a man can not make himself believe anything he please nor do they drive any to dissemble their thought by threatenings so that men be not tempt to lie or disguise their opinion which be a sort of fraud be abhor by the utopian they take care indeed to prevent their disputing in defence of these opinion especially before the common people but they suffer and even encourage them to dispute concern them in private with their priest and other grave men be confident that they will be cure of those mad opinion by have reason lay before them there be many among them that run far to the other extreme though it be neither think an ill nor unreasonable opinion and therefore be not at all discourage they think that the soul of beast be immortal though far inferior to the dignity of the human soul and not capable of so great a happiness they be almost all of them very firmly persuade that good men will be infinitely happy in another state so that though they be compassionate to all that be sick yet they lament no man death except they see him loath to part with life for they look on this a a very ill presage a if the soul conscious to itself of guilt and quite hopeless be afraid to leave the body from some secret hint of approach misery they think that such a man appearance before god can not be acceptable to him who be call on do not go out cheerfully but be backward and unwilling and be a it be drag to it they be strike with horror when they see any die in this manner and carry them out in silence and with sorrow and pray god that he would be merciful to the error of the departed soul they lay the body in the ground but when any die cheerfully and full of hope they do not mourn for them but sing hymn when they carry out their body and commend their soul very earnestly to god their whole behaviour be then rather grave than sad they burn the body and set up a pillar where the pile be make with an inscription to the honour of the decease when they come from the funeral they discourse of hi good life and worthy action but speak of nothing oftener and with more pleasure than of hi serenity at the hour of death they think such respect pay to the memory of good men be both the great incitement to engage other to follow their example and the most acceptable worship that can be offer them for they believe that though by the imperfection of human sight they be invisible to u yet they be present among u and hear those discourse that pass concern themselves they believe it inconsistent with the happiness of departed soul not to be at liberty to be where they will and do not imagine them capable of the ingratitude of not desire to see those friend with whom they live on earth in the strict bond of love and kindness besides they be persuade that good men after death have these affection and all other good disposition increase rather than diminish and therefore conclude that they be still among the living and observe all they say or do from hence they engage in all their affair with the great confidence of success a trust to their protection while this opinion of the presence of their ancestor be a restraint that prevent their engaging in ill design they despise and laugh at augury and the other vain and superstitious way of divination so much observe among other nation but have great reverence for such miracle a can not flow from any of the power of nature and look on them a effect and indication of the presence of the supreme being of which they say many instance have occur among them and that sometimes their public prayer which upon great and dangerous occasion they have solemnly put up to god with assured confidence of be hear have be answer in a miraculous manner they think the contemplating god in hi work and the adore him for them be a very acceptable piece of worship to him there be many among them that upon a motive of religion neglect learning and apply themselves to no sort of study nor do they allow themselves any leisure time but be perpetually employ believing that by the good thing that a man do he secure to himself that happiness that come after death some of these visit the sick other mend highway cleanse ditch repair bridge or dig turf gravel or stone other fell and cleave timber and bring wood corn and other necessary on cart into their town nor do these only serve the public but they serve even private men more than the slave themselves do for if there be anywhere a rough hard and sordid piece of work to be do from which many be frighten by the labour and loathsomeness of it if not the despair of accomplish it they cheerfully and of their own accord take that to their share and by that mean a they ease other very much so they afflict themselves and spend their whole life in hard labour and yet they do not value themselves upon this nor lessen other people credit to raise their own but by their stooping to such servile employment they be so far from be despise that they be so much the more esteemed by the whole nation of these there be two sort some live unmarried and chaste and abstain from eat any sort of flesh and thus wean themselves from all the pleasure of the present life which they account hurtful they pursue even by the hardest and painfullest method possible that blessedness which they hope for hereafter and the nearer they approach to it they be the more cheerful and earnest in their endeavour after it another sort of them be less willing to put themselves to much toil and therefore prefer a married state to a single one and a they do not deny themselves the pleasure of it so they think the begetting of child be a debt which they owe to human nature and to their country nor do they avoid any pleasure that do not hinder labour and therefore eat flesh so much the more willingly a they find that by this mean they be the more able to work the utopian look upon these a the wiser sect but they esteem the other a the most holy they would indeed laugh at any man who from the principle of reason would prefer an unmarried state to a marry or a life of labour to an easy life but they reverence and admire such a do it from the motif of religion there be nothing in which they be more cautious than in give their opinion positively concern any sort of religion the men that lead those severe life be call in the language of their country brutheskas which answer to those we call religious order their priest be men of eminent piety and therefore they be but few for there be only thirteen in every town one for every temple but when they go to war seven of these go out with their force and seven other be choose to supply their room in their absence but these enter again upon their employment when they return and those who serve in their absence attend upon the high priest till vacancy fall by death for there be one set over the rest they be choose by the people a the other magistrate be by suffrage give in secret for prevent of faction and when they be choose they be consecrate by the college of priest the care of all sacred thing the worship of god and an inspection into the manner of the people be commit to them it be a reproach to a man to be send for by any of them or for them to speak to him in secret for that always give some suspicion all that be incumbent on them be only to exhort and admonish the people for the power of correcting and punishing ill men belong wholly to the prince and to the other magistrates the severe thing that the priest do be the exclude those that be desperately wicked from join in their worship there be not any sort of punishment more dread by them than this for a it load them with infamy so it fill them with secret horror such be their reverence to their religion nor will their body be long exempt from their share of trouble for if they do not very quickly satisfy the priest of the truth of their repentance they be seize on by the senate and punish for their impiety the education of youth belongs to the priest yet they do not take so much care of instruct them in letter a in form their mind and manner aright they use all possible method to infuse very early into the tender and flexible mind of child such opinion a be both good in themselves and will be useful to their country for when deep impression of these thing be make at that age they follow men through the whole course of their life and conduce much to preserve the peace of the governmentwhich suffers by nothing more than by vice that rise out of ill opinion the wife of their priest be the most extraordinary woman of the whole country sometimes the woman themselves be make priest though that fall out but seldom nor be any but ancient widow choose into that order none of the magistrate have great honour pay them than be pay the priest and if they should happen to commit any crime they would not be question for it their punishment be leave to god and to their own conscience for they do not think it lawful to lay hand on any man how wicked soever he be that have be in a peculiar manner dedicate to god nor do they find any great inconvenience in this both because they have so few priest and because these be choose with much caution so that it must be a very unusual thing to find one who merely out of regard to hi virtue and for hi be esteem a singularly good man be raise up to so great a dignity degenerate into corruption and vice and if such a thing should fall out for man be a changeable creature yet there be few priest and these have no authority but what rise out of the respect that be pay them nothing of great consequence to the public can proceed from the indemnity that the priest enjoy they have indeed very few of them l great number share in the same honour might make the dignity of that order which they esteem so highly to sink in it reputation they also think it difficult to find out many of such an exalted pitch of goodness a to be equal to that dignity which demand the exercise of more than ordinary virtue nor be the priest in great veneration among them than they be among their neighbouring nation a you may imagine by that which i think give occasion for it when the utopian engage in battle the priest who accompany them to the war apparel in their sacred vestment kneel down during the action in a place not far from the field and lift up their hand to heaven pray first for peace and then for victory to their own side and particularly that it may be gain without the effusion of much blood on either side and when the victory turn to their side they run in among their own men to restrain their fury and if any of their enemy see them or call to them they be preserve by that mean and such a can come so near them a to touch their garment have not only their life but their fortune secure to them it be upon this account that all the nation round about consider them so much and treat them with such reverence that they have be often no less able to preserve their own people from the fury of their enemy than to save their enemy from their rage for it have sometimes fall out that when their army have be in disorder and force to fly so that their enemy be run upon the slaughter and spoil the priest by interpose have separate them from one another and stop the effusion of more blood so that by their mediation a peace have be conclude on very reasonable term nor be there any nation about them so fierce cruel or barbarous a not to look upon their person a sacred and inviolable the first and the last day of the month and of the year be a festival they measure their month by the course of the moon and their year by the course of the sun the first day be call in their language the cynemernes and the last the trapemernes which answer in our language to the festival that begin or end the season they have magnificent temple that be not only nobly build but extremely spacious which be the more necessary a they have so few of them they be a little dark within which proceeds not from any error in the architecture but be do with design for their priest think that too much light dissipate the thought and that a more moderate degree of it both recollect the mind and raise devotion though there be many different form of religion among them yet all these how various soever agree in the main point which be the worship the divine essence and therefore there be nothing to be see or hear in their temple in which the several persuasion among them may not agree for every sect performs those rite that be peculiar to it in their private house nor be there anything in the public worship that contradict the particular way of those different sect there be no image for god in their temple so that every one may represent him to hi thought accord to the way of hi religion nor do they call this one god by any other name but that of mithra which be the common name by which they all express the divine essence whatsoever otherwise they think it to be nor be there any prayer among them but such a every one of them may use without prejudice to hi own opinion they meet in their temple on the evening of the festival that conclude a season and not have yet break their fast they thank god for their good success during that year or month which be then at an end and the next day be that which begin the new season they meet early in their temple to pray for the happy progress of all their affair during that period upon which they then enter in the festival which conclude the period before they go to the temple both wife and child fall on their knee before their husband or parent and confess everything in which they have either err or fail in their duty and beg pardon for it thus all little discontent in family be remove that they may offer up their devotion with a pure and serene mind for they hold it a great impiety to enter upon them with disturbed thought or with a consciousness of their bearing hatred or anger in their heart to any person whatsoever and think that they should become liable to severe punishment if they presume to offer sacrifice without cleanse their heart and reconcile all their difference in the temple the two sex be separate the men go to the right hand and the woman to the left and the male and female all place themselves before the head and master or mistress of the family to which they belong so that those who have the governmentof them at home may see their deportment in public and they intermingle them so that the young and the old may be set by one another for if the young sort be all set together they would perhaps trifle away that time too much in which they ought to beget in themselves that religious dread of the supreme being which be the great and almost the only incitement to virtue they offer up no living creature in sacrifice nor do they think it suitable to the divine being from whose bounty it be that these creature have derive their life to take pleasure in their death or the offer up their blood they burn incense and other sweet odour and have a great number of wax light during their worship not out of any imagination that such oblation can add anything to the divine nature which even prayer can not do but a it be a harmless and pure way of worship god so they think those sweet savour and light together with some other ceremony by a secret and unaccountable virtue elevate men soul and inflame them with great energy and cheerfulness during the divine worship all the people appear in the temple in white garment but the priest vestment be particoloured and both the work and colour be wonderful they be make of no rich material for they be neither embroidered nor set with precious stone but be compose of the plume of several bird lay together with so much art and so neatly that the true value of them be far beyond the costly material they say that in the ordering and place those plume some dark mystery be represent which pass down among their priest in a secret tradition concern them and that they be a hieroglyphic put them in mind of the blessing that they have receive from god and of their duty both to him and to their neighbour as soon a the priest appear in those ornament they all fall prostrate on the ground with so much reverence and so deep a silence that such a look on can not but be strike with it a if it be the effect of the appearance of a deity after they have be for some time in this posture they all stand up upon a sign give by the priest and sing hymn to the honour of god some musical instrument play all the while these be quite of another form than those use among u but a many of them be much sweet than ours so other be make use of by u yet in one thing they very much exceed u all their music both vocal and instrumental be adapt to imitate and express the passion and be so happily suit to every occasion that whether the subject of the hymn be cheerful or form to soothe or trouble the mind or to express grief or remorse the music take the impression of whatever be represent affect and kindle the passion and work the sentiment deep into the heart of the hearer when this be do both priest and people offer up very solemn prayer to god in a set form of word and these be so composed that whatsoever be pronounce by the whole assembly may be likewise apply by every man in particular to hi own condition in these they acknowledge god to be the author and governor of the world and the fountain of all the good they receive and therefore offer up to him their thanksgiving and in particular bless him for hi goodness in order it so that they be bear under the happy governmentin the world and be of a religion which they hope be the truest of all other but if they be mistake and if there be either a good governmentor a religion more acceptable to god they implore hi goodness to let them know it vow that they resolve to follow him whithersoever he lead them but if their governmentbe the best and their religion the true then they pray that he may fortify them in it and bring all the world both to the same rule of life and to the same opinion concern himself unless accord to the unsearchableness of hi mind he be pleased with a variety of religion then they pray that god may give them an easy passage at last to himself not presume to set limit to him how early or late it should be but if it may be wish for without derogate from hi supreme authority they desire to be quickly deliver and to be take to himself though by the most terrible kind of death rather than to be detain long from see him by the most prosperous course of life when this prayer be end they all fall down again upon the ground and after a little while they rise up go home to dinner and spend the rest of the day in diversion or military exercise thus have i describe to you as particularly a i could the constitution of that commonwealth which i do not only think the best in the world but indeed the only commonwealth that truly deserve that name in all other place it be visible that while people talk of a commonwealth every man only seek hi own wealth but there where no man have any property all men zealously pursue the good of the public and indeed it be no wonder to see men act so differently for in other commonwealth every man know that unless he provide for himself how flourishing soever the commonwealth may be he must die of hunger so that he see the necessity of prefer hi own concern to the public but in utopia where every man have a right to everything they all know that if care be take to keep the public store full no private man can want anything for among them there be no unequal distribution so that no man be poor none in necessity and though no man have anything yet they be all rich for what can make a man so rich a to lead a serene and cheerful life free from anxiety neither apprehend want himself nor vexed with the endless complaint of hi wife he be not afraid of the misery of hi child nor be he contrive how to raise a portion for hi daughter but be secure in this that both he and hi wife hi child and grandchild to a many generation a he can fancy will all live both plentifully and happily since among them there be no less care take of those who be once engage in labour but grow afterwards unable to follow it than there be elsewhere of these that continue still employ i would gladly hear any man compare the justice that be among them with that of all other nation among whom may i perish if i see anything that look either like justice or equity for what justice be there in this that a nobleman a goldsmith a banker or any other man that either do nothing at all or at best be employ in thing that be of no use to the public should live in great luxury and splendour upon what be so ill acquire and a mean man a carter a smith or a ploughman that work hard even than the beast themselves and be employ in labour so necessary that no commonwealth could hold out a year without them can only earn so poor a livelihood and must lead so miserable a life that the condition of the beast be much good than theirs for a the beast do not work so constantly so they fee almost as well and with more pleasure and have no anxiety about what be to come whilst these men be depress by a barren and fruitless employment and torment with the apprehension of want in their old age since that which they get by their daily labour do but maintain them at present and be consume a fast a it come in there be no overplus leave to lay up for old age be not that governmentboth unjust and ungrateful that be so prodigal of it favour to those that be call gentleman or goldsmith or such other who be idle or live either by flattery or by contrive the art of vain pleasure and on the other hand take no care of those of a meaner sort such a plowman collier and smith without whom it could not subsist but after the public have reap all the advantage of their service and they come to be oppress with age sickness and want all their labour and the good they have do be forget and all the recompense give them be that they be leave to die in great misery the rich sort be often endeavour to bring the hire of labourer low not only by their fraudulent practice but by the law which they procure to be make to that effect so that though it be a thing most unjust in itself to give such small reward to those who deserve so well of the public yet they have give those hardship the name and colour of justice by procure law to be make for regulate them therefore i must say that a i hope for mercy i can have no other notion of all the other governmentthat i see or know than that they be a conspiracy of the rich who on pretence of manage the public only pursue their private end and devise all the way and art they can find out first that they may without danger preserve all that they have so illacquired and then that they may engage the poor to toil and labour for them at a low rate a possible and oppress them as much a they please and if they can but prevail to get these contrivance establish by the show of public authority which be consider a the representative of the whole people then they be account law yet these wicked men after they have by a most insatiable covetousness divide that among themselves with which all the rest might have be well supply be far from that happiness that be enjoy among the utopian for the use as well a the desire of money be extinguish much anxiety and great occasion of mischief be cut off with it and who do not see that the frauds theft robbery quarrel tumult contention sedition murder treachery and witchcraft which be indeed rather punish than restrain by the severity of law would all fall off if money be not any more value by the world men fear solicitudes care labour and watching would all perish in the same moment with the value of money even poverty itself for the relief of which money seem most necessary would fall but in order to the apprehend this aright take one instance consider any year that have be so unfruitful that many thousand have die of hunger and yet if at the end of that year a survey be make of the granary of all the rich men that have hoard up the corn it would be find that there be enough among them to have prevent all that consumption of men that perish in misery and that if it have be distribute among them none would have felt the terrible effect of that scarcity so easy a thing would it be to supply all the necessity of life if that bless thing call money which be pretend to be invent for procure them be not really the only thing that obstruct their be procure i do not doubt but rich men be sensible of this and that they well know how much a great happiness it be to want nothing necessary than to abound in many superfluity and to be rescue out of so much misery than to abound with so much wealth and i can not think but the sense of every man interest add to the authority of christ command who a he be infinitely wise know what be best and be not less good in discover it to u would have draw all the world over to the law of the utopian if pride that plague of human nature that source of so much misery do not hinder it for this vice do not measure happiness so much by it own convenience a by the misery of other and would not be satisfy with be think a goddess if none be leave that be miserable over whom she might insult pride think it own happiness shin the brighter by compare it with the misfortune of other person that by display it own wealth they may feel their poverty the more sensibly this be that infernal serpent that creep into the breast of mortal and possess them too much to be easily draw out and therefore i be glad that the utopian have fall upon this form of governmentin which i wish that all the world could be so wise a to imitate them for they have indeed lay down such a scheme and foundation of policy that a men live happily under it so it be like to be of great continuance for they have root out of the mind of their people all the seed both of ambition and faction there be no danger of any commotion at home which alone have be the ruin of many state that seem otherwise to be well secure but as long a they live in peace at home and be govern by such good law the envy of all their neighbouring prince who have often though in vain attempt their ruin will never be able to put their state into any commotion or disorder when raphael have thus make an end of speak though many thing occur to me both concern the manner and law of that people that seem very absurd a well in their way of make war a in their notion of religion and divine matter together with several other particular but chiefly what seem the foundation of all the rest their living in common without the use of money by which all nobility magnificence splendour and majesty which accord to the common opinion be the true ornament of a nation would be quite take away yet since i perceive that raphael be weary and be not sure whether he could easily bear contradiction remember that he have take notice of some who seem to think they be bind in honour to support the credit of their own wisdom by find out something to censure in all other men invention besides their own i only commend their constitution and the account he have give of it in general and so take him by the hand carry him to supper and tell him i would find out some other time for examine this subject more particularly and for discourse more copiously upon it and indeed i shall be glad to embrace an opportunity of do it in the meanwhile though it must be confess that he be both a very learned man and a person who have obtain a great knowledge of the world i can not perfectly agree to everything he have relate however there be many thing in the commonwealth of utopia that i rather wish than hope to see follow in our government
