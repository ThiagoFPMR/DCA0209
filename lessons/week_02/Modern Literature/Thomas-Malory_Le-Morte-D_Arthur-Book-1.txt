and make great joy of hi victory and then he fell pass sore sick so that three day and three night he be speechless wherefore all the baron make great sorrow and ask merlin what counsel be best there be none other remedy say merlin but god will have hi will but look ye all baron be before king uther tomorn and god and i shall make him to speak so on the morn all the baron with merlin come tofore the king then merlin say aloud unto king uther sir shall your son arthur be king after your day of this realm with all the appurtenance then uther pendragon turn him and say in hearing of them all i give him god blessing and mine and bid him pray for my soul and righteously and worship that he claim the crown upon forfeiture of my blessing and therewith he yield up the ghost and then be he inter a long to a king wherefore the queen fair igraine make great sorrow and all the baron then stand the realm in great jeopardy long while for every lord that be mighty of men make him strong and many weened to have be king then merlin go to the archbishop of canterbury and counsel him for to send for all the lord of the realm and all the gentleman of arm that they should to london come by christmas upon pain of cursing and for this cause that jesus that be bear on that night that he would of hi great mercy show some miracle a he be come to be king of mankind for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm so the archbishop by the advice of merlin send for all the lord and gentleman of arm that they should come by christmas even unto london and many of them make them clean of their life that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto god so in the great church of london whether it be paul or not the french book maketh no mention all the estate be long or day in the church for to pray and when matins and the first mass be do there be see in the churchyard against the high altar a great stone four square like unto a marble stone and in midst thereof be like an anvil of steel a foot on high and therein stick a fair sword naked by the point and letter there be write in gold about the sword that say thus whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil be rightwise king born of all england then the people marvel and tell it to the archbishop i command say the archbishop that ye keep you within your church and pray unto god still that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all do so when all mass be do all the lord go to behold the stone and the sword and when they saw the scripture some assay such a would have be king but none might stir the sword nor move it he be not here say the archbishop that shall achieve the sword but doubt not god will make him know but this be my counsel say the archbishop that we let purvey ten knight men of good fame and they to keep this sword so it be ordain and then there be make a cry that every man should assay that would for to win the sword and upon new year day the baron let make a joust and a tournament that all knight that would joust or tourney there might play and all this be ordain for to keep the lord together and the common for the archbishop trust that god would make him know that should win the sword so upon new year day when the service be do the baron ride unto the field some to joust and some to tourney and so it happen that sir ector that have great livelihood about london rode unto the joust and with him ride sir kay hi son and young arthur that be hi nourished brother and sir kay be make knight at all hallowmas afore so a they ride to the joustsward sir kay lose hi sword for he have leave it at hi father lodge and so he pray young arthur for to ride for hi sword i will well say arthur and ride fast after the sword and when he come home the lady and all be out to see the jousting then be arthur wroth and say to himself i will ride to the churchyard and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone for my brother sir kay shall not be without a sword this day so when he come to the churchyard sir arthur alight and tie hi horse to the stile and so he go to the tent and find no knight there for they be at the jousting and so he handle the sword by the handle and lightly and fiercely pull it out of the stone and take hi horse and ride hi way until he come to hi brother sir kay and deliver him the sword and as soon a sir kay saw the sword he wist well it be the sword of the stone and so he ride to hi father sir ector and say sir lo here be the sword of the stone wherefore i must be king of this land when sir ector behold the sword he return again and come to the church and there they alight all three and go into the church and anon he make sir kay swear upon a book how he come to that sword sir say sir kay by my brother arthur for he bring it to me how gat ye this sword say sir ector to arthur sir i will tell you when i come home for my brother sword i find nobody at home to deliver me hi sword and so i think my brother sir kay should not be swordless and so i come hither eagerly and pull it out of the stone without any pain found ye any knight about this sword say sir ector nay say arthur now say sir ector to arthur i understand ye must be king of this land wherefore i say arthur and for what cause sir say ector for god will have it so for there should never man have draw out this sword but he that shall be rightwise king of this land now let me see whether ye can put the sword there a it be and pull it out again that be no mastery say arthur and so he put it in the stone wherewithal sir ector assay to pull out the sword and fail now assay say sir ector unto sir kay and anon he pull at the sword with all hi might but it would not be now shall ye assay say sir ector to arthur i will well say arthur and pull it out easily and therewithal sir ector kneel down to the earth and sir kay ala say arthur my own dear father and brother why kneel ye to me nay nay my lord arthur it be not so i be never your father nor of your blood but i wot well ye be of an high blood than i weened ye be and then sir ector tell him all how he be betaken him for to nourish him and by whose commandment and by merlin deliverance then arthur make great dole when he understand that sir ector be not hi father sir say ector unto arthur will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye be king els be i to blame say arthur for ye be the man in the world that i be most beholden to and my good lady and mother your wife that as well a her own hath foster me and keep and if ever it be god will that i be king a ye say ye shall desire of me what i may do and i shall not fail you god forbid i should fail you sir say sir ector i will ask no more of you but that ye will make my son your foster brother sir kay seneschal of all your land that shall be do say arthur and more by the faith of my body that never man shall have that office but he while he and i live therewithal they go unto the archbishop and tell him how the sword be achieve and by whom and on twelfthday all the baron come thither and to assay to take the sword who that would assay but there afore them all there might none take it out but arthur wherefore there be many lord wroth and say it be great shame unto them all and the realm to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood born and so they fell out at that time that it be put off till candlemas and then all the baron should meet there again but always the ten knight be ordain to watch the sword day and night and so they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword and five always watch so at candlemas many more great lord come thither for to have win the sword but there might none prevail and right a arthur do at christmas he do at candlemas and pull out the sword easily whereof the baron be sore aggrieve and put it off in delay till the high feast of easter and a arthur speed before so do he at easter yet there be some of the great lord have indignation that arthur should be king and put it off in a delay till the feast of pentecost then the archbishop of canterbury by merlin providence let purvey then of the best knight that they might get and such knight a uther pendragon love best and most trust in hi day and such knight be put about arthur a sir baudwin of britain sir kay sir ulfius sir brastias all these with many other be always about arthur day and night till the feast of pentecost and at the feast of pentecost all manner of men assay to pull at the sword that would assay but none might prevail but arthur and pull it out afore all the lord and common that be there wherefore all the common cry at once we will have arthur unto our king we will put him no more in delay for we all see that it be god will that he shall be our king and who that holdeth against it we will slay him and therewithal they kneel at once both rich and poor and cry arthur mercy because they have delay him so long and arthur forgive them and take the sword between both hi hand and offer it upon the altar where the archbishop be and so be he make knight of the best man that be there and so anon be the coronation make and there be he swear unto hi lord and the common for to be a true king to stand with true justice from thenceforth the day of this life also then he make all lord that hold of the crown to come in and to do service a they ought to do and many complaint be make unto sir arthur of great wrong that be do since the death of king uther of many land that be bereave lord knight lady and gentleman wherefore king arthur make the land to be give again unto them that own them when this be do that the king have stablished all the country about london then he let make sir kay seneschal of england and sir baudwin of britain be make constable and sir ulfius be make chamberlain and sir brastias be make warden to wait upon the north from trent forward for it be that time the most party the king enemy but within few year after arthur win all the north scotland and all that be under their obeissance also wales a part of it hold against arthur but he overcome them all a he do the remnant through the noble prowess of himself and hi knight of the round table then the king remove into wale and let cry a great feast that it should be holden at pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city of carlion unto the feast come king lot of lothian and of orkney with five hundred knight with him also there come to the feast king uriens of gore with four hundred knight with him also there come to that feast king nentres of garlot with seven hundred knight with him also there come to the feast the king of scotland with six hundred knight with him and he be but a young man also there come to the feast a king that be call the king with the hundred knight but he and hi men be pass well beseen at all point also there come the king of carados with five hundred knight and king arthur be glad of their come for he weened that all the king and knight have come for great love and to have do him worship at hi feast wherefore the king make great joy and send the king and knight great present but the king would none receive but rebuke the messenger shamefully and say they have no joy to receive no gift of a beardless boy that be come of low blood and send him word they would none of hi gift but that they be come to give him gift with hard sword betwixt the neck and the shoulder and therefore they come thither so they tell to the messenger plainly for it be great shame to all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a realm a this land be with this answer the messenger depart and tell to king arthur this answer wherefore by the advice of hi baron he take him to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him and all the king aforesaid in a manner lay a siege tofore him but king arthur be well victualed and within fifteen day there come merlin among them into the city of carlion then all the king be pass glad of merlin and ask him for what cause be that boy arthur make your king sir say merlin i shall tell you the cause for he be king uther pendragon son bear in wedlock gotten on igraine the dukes wife of tintagil then be he a bastard they say all nay say merlin after the death of the duke more than three hour be arthur begotten and thirteen day after king uther wed igraine and therefore i prove him he be no bastard and who saith nay he shall be king and overcome all hi enemy and or he die he shall be long king of all england and have under hi obeissance wale ireland and scotland and more realm than i will now rehearse some of the king have marvel of merlin word and deem well that it should be a he say and some of them laugh him to scorn a king lot and more other call him a witch but then be they accord with merlin that king arthur should come out and speak with the king and to come safe and to go safe such surance there be make so merlin go unto king arthur and tell him how he have do and bid him fear not but come out boldly and speak with them and spare them not but answer them a their king and chieftain for ye shall overcome them all whether they will or nill then king arthur come out of hi tower and have under hi gown a jesseraunt of double mail and there go with him the archbishop of canterbury and sir baudwin of britain and sir kay and sir brastias these be the men of most worship that be with him and when they be meet there be no meekness but stout word on both side but always king arthur answer them and say he would make them to bow an he live wherefore they depart with wrath and king arthur bid keep them well and they bid the king keep him well so the king return him to the tower again and arm him and all hi knight what will ye do say merlin to the king ye be good for to stint for ye shall not here prevail though ye be ten time so many be we well advise to be afeared of a dreamreader say king lot with that merlin vanish away and come to king arthur and bid him set on them fiercely and in the meanwhile there be three hundred good men of the best that be with the king that go straight unto king arthur and that comfort him greatly sir say merlin to arthur fight not with the sword that ye have by miracle till that ye see ye go unto the bad then draw it out and do your best so forthwith king arthur set upon them in their lodging and sir baudwin sir kay and sir brastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it be marvel and always king arthur on horseback lay on with a sword and do marvellous deed of arm that many of the king have great joy of hi deed and hardiness then king lot brake out on the back side and the king with the hundred knight and king carados and set on arthur fiercely behind him with that sir arthur turn with hi knight and smote behind and before and ever sir arthur be in the foremost press till hi horse be slay underneath him and therewith king lot smite down king arthur with that hi four knight receive him and set him on horseback then he draw hi sword excalibur but it be so bright in hi enemy eye that it give light like thirty torch and therewith he put them aback and slew much people and then the common of carlion arose with club and stave and slew many knight but all the king hold them together with their knight that be leave alive and so fled and departed and merlin come unto arthur and counsel him to follow them no far so after the feast and journey king arthur draw him unto london and so by the counsel of merlin the king let call hi baron to council for merlin have tell the king that the six king that make war upon him would in all haste be awroke on him and on hi land wherefore the king ask counsel at them all they could no counsel give but say they be big enough ye say well say arthur i thank you for your good courage but will ye all that loveth me speak with merlin ye know well that he hath do much for me and he knoweth many thing and when he be afore you i would that ye pray him heartily of hi best advice all the baron say they would pray him and desire him so merlin be send for and fair desire of all the baron to give them best counsel i shall say you say merlin i warn you all your enemy be pass strong for you and they be good men of arm a be alive and by this time they have get to them four king more and a mighty duke and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than he may make within the bound of hi own realm an he fight with them in battle he shall be overcome and slay what be best to do in this cause say all the baron i shall tell you say merlin mine advice there be two brother beyond the sea and they be kings both and marvellous good men of their hand and that one hight king ban of benwick and that other hight king bors of gaul that be france and on these two king warreth a mighty man of men the king claudas and striveth with them for a castle and great war be betwixt them but this claudas be so mighty of good whereof he getteth good knight that he putteth these two king most part to the bad wherefore this be my counsel that our king and sovereign lord send unto the king ban and bors by two trusty knight with letter well devise that an they will come and see king arthur and hi court and so help him in hi war that he will be swear unto them to help them in their war against king claudas now what say ye unto this counsel say merlin this be well counsel say the king and all the baron right so in all haste there be ordain to go two knight on the message unto the two king so be there make letter in the pleasant wise accord unto king arthur desire ulfius and brastias be make the messenger and so rode forth well horse and well armed and a the guise be that time and so pass the sea and rode toward the city of benwick and there besides be eight knight that espy them and at a strait passage they meet with ulfius and brastias and would have take them prisoner so they pray them that they might pass for they be messenger unto king ban and bors send from king arthur therefore say the eight knight ye shall die or be prisoner for we be knight of king claudas and therewith two of them dress their spear and ulfius and brastias dress their spear and run together with great raundom and claudas knight brake their spear and theirs toheld and bare the two knight out of their saddle to the earth and so leave them lie and ride their way and the other six knight ride afore to a passage to meet with them again and so ulfius and brastias smite other two down and so pass on their way and at the fourth passage there meet two for two and both be lay unto the earth so there be none of the eight knight but he be sore hurt or bruise and when they come to benwick it fortuned there be both king ban and bors and when it be tell the king that there be come messenger there be send unto them two knight of worship the one hight lionses lord of the country of payarne and sir phariance a worshipful knight anon they ask from whence they come and they say from king arthur king of england so they take them in their arm and make great joy each of other but anon a the two king wist they be messenger of arthur there be make no tarry but forthwith they spake with the knight and welcome them in the faithfullest wise and say they be most welcome unto them before all the king living and therewith they kiss the letter and deliver them and when ban and bors understand the letter then they be more welcome than they be before and after the haste of the letter they give them this answer that they would fulfil the desire of king arthur writing and ulfius and brastias tarry there as long a they would they should have such cheer a might be make them in those march then ulfius and brastias tell the king of the adventure at their passage of the eight knight ha ah say ban and bors they be my good friend i would i have wist of them they should not have escape so so ulfius and brastias have good cheer and great gift as much a they might bear away and have their answer by mouth and by write that those two king would come unto arthur in all the haste that they might so the two knight ride on afore and pass the sea and come to their lord and tell him how they have speed whereof king arthur be pass glad at what time suppose ye the two king will be here sir say they afore all hallowmas then the king let purvey for a great feast and let cry a great joust and by all hallowmas the two king be come over the sea with three hundred knight well arrayed both for the peace and for the war and king arthur meet with them ten mile out of london and there be great joy a could be think or make and on all hallowmas at the great feast sit in the hall the three king and sir kay seneschal serve in the hall and sir lucas the butler that be duke corneus son and sir griflet that be the son of cardol these three knight have the rule of all the service that serve the king and anon a they have washen and rise all knight that would joust make them ready by then they be ready on horseback there be seven hundred knight and arthur ban and bors with the archbishop of canterbury and sir ector kays father they be in a place cover with cloth of gold like an hall with lady and gentlewoman for to behold who do best and thereon to give judgment and king arthur and the two king let depart the seven hundred knight in two party and there be three hundred knight of the realm of benwick and of gaul turn on the other side then they dress their shield and begin to couch their spear many good knight so griflet be the first that met with a knight one ladinas and they meet so eagerly that all men have wonder and they so fight that their shield fell to piece and horse and man fell to the earth and both the french knight and the english knight lay so long that all men weened they have be dead when lucas the butler saw griflet so lie he horse him again anon and they two do marvellous deed of arm with many bachelor also sir kay come out of an ambush with five knight with him and they six smite other six down but sir kay do that day marvellous deed of arm that there be none do so well a he that day then there come ladinas and gracian two knight of france and do pass well that all men praise them then come there sir placidas a good knight and meet with sir kay and smite him down horse and man where fore sir griflet be wroth and meet with sir placidas so hard that horse and man fell to the earth but when the five knight wist that sir kay have a fall they be wroth out of wit and therewith each of them five bare down a knight when king arthur and the two king saw them begin to wax wroth on both party they leap on small hackney and let cry that all men should depart unto their lodging and so they go home and unarm them and so to evensong and supper and after the three king go into a garden and give the prize unto sir kay and to lucas the butler and unto sir griflet and then they go unto council and with them gwenbaus the brother unto sir ban and bors a wise clerk and thither go ulfius and brastias and merlin and after they have be in council they go unto bed and on the morn they hear mass and to dinner and so to their council and make many argument what be best to do at the last they be conclude that merlin should go with a token of king ban and that be a ring unto hi men and king bors and gracian and placidas should go again and keep their castle and their country a for king ban of benwick and king bors of gaul have ordain them and so pass the sea and come to benwick and when the people saw king ban ring and gracian and placidas they be glad and ask how the king fare and make great joy of their welfare and cording and accord unto the sovereign lord desire the men of war make them ready in all haste possible so that they be fifteen thousand on horse and foot and they have great plenty of victual with them by merlin provision but gracian and placidas be leave to furnish and garnish the castle for dread of king claudas right so merlin pass the sea well victual both by water and by land and when he come to the sea he send home the footman again and take no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback the most part men of arm and so shipped and pass the sea into england and land at dover and through the wit of merlin he have the host northward the privy way that could be think unto the forest of bedegraine and there in a valley he lodge them secretly then ride merlin unto arthur and the two king and tell them how he have speed whereof they have great marvel that man on earth might speed so soon and go and come so merlin tell them ten thousand be in the forest of bedegraine well arm at all point then be there no more to say but to horseback go all the host a arthur have afore purvey so with twenty thousand he pass by night and day but there be make such an ordinance afore by merlin that there should no man of war ride nor go in no country on this side trent water but if he have a token from king arthur where through the king enemy durst not ride a they do tofore to espy and so within a little space the three king come unto the castle of bedegraine and find there a passing fair fellowship and well beseen whereof they have great joy and victual they want none this be the cause of the northern host that they be rear for the despite and rebuke the six king have at carlion and those six king by their mean gat unto them five other king and thus they begin to gather their people and now they sware that for weal nor woe they should not leave other till they have destroy arthur and then they make an oath the first that begin the oath be the duke of cambenet that he would bring with him five thousand men of arm the which be ready on horseback then sware king brandegoris of stranggore that he would bring five thousand men of arm on horseback then sware king clariance of northumberland he would bring three thousand men of arm then sware the king of the hundred knight that be a passing good man and a young that he would bring four thousand men of arm on horseback then

they rescue themselves and their fellowship marvellously when king bors saw those knight put aback it grieve him sore then he come on so fast that hi fellowship seem as black a inde when king lot have espy king bors he know him well then he say o jesu defend u from death and horrible maims for i see well we be in great peril of death for i see yonder a king one of the most worshipfullest men and one of the best knight of the world be incline unto hi fellowship what be he say the king with the hundred knight it be say king lot king bors of gaul i marvel how they come into this country without witting of u all it be by merlin advice say the knight a for him say king carados i will encounter with king bors an ye will rescue me when myster be go on say they all we will do all that we may then king carados and hi host rode on a soft pace till that they come a nigh king bors a bowdraught then either battle let their horse run as fast a they might and bleoberis that be godson unto king bors he bare hi chief standard that be a passing good knight now shall we see say king bors how these northern briton can bear the arm and king bors encounter with a knight and smote him throughout with a spear that he fell dead unto the earth and after draw hi sword and do marvellous deed of arm that all party have great wonder thereof and hi knight fail not but do their part and king carados be smite to the earth with that come the king with the hundred knight and rescue king carados mightily by force of arm for he be a passing good knight of a king and but a young man by then come into the field king ban as fierce a a lion with band of green and thereupon gold ha a say king lot we must be discomfit for yonder i see the most valiant knight of the world and the man of the most renown for such two brother a be king ban and king bors be not live wherefore we must need void or die and but if we avoid manly and wisely there be but death when king ban come into the battle he come in so fiercely that the stroke redound again from the wood and the water wherefore king lot wept for pity and dole that he saw so many good knight take their end but through the great force of king ban they make both the northern battle that be depart hurtle together for great dread and the three king and their knight slew on ever that it be pity on to behold that multitude of the people that flee but king lot and king of the hundred knight and king morganore gather the people together pass knightly and do great prowess of arm and hold the battle all that day like hard when the king of the hundred knight behold the great damage that king ban do he thrust unto him with hi horse and smite him on high upon the helm a great stroke and astonied him sore then king ban be wroth with him and follow on him fiercely the other saw that and cast up hi shield and spur hi horse forward but the stroke of king ban fell down and carve a cantel off the shield and the sword slide down by the hauberk behind hi back and cut through the trapping of steel and the horse even in two piece that the sword felt the earth then the king of the hundred knight void the horse lightly and with hi sword he broach the horse of king ban through and through with that king ban void lightly from the dead horse and then king ban smote at the other so eagerly and smite him on the helm that he fell to the earth also in that ire he fell king morganore and there be great slaughter of good knight and much people by then come into the press king arthur and find king ban stand among dead men and dead horse fight on foot a a wood lion that there come none nigh him as far a he might reach with hi sword but he catch a grievous buffet whereof king arthur have great pity and arthur be so bloody that by hi shield there might no man know him for all be blood and brain on hi sword and a arthur look by him he saw a knight that be passingly well horse and therewith sir arthur run to him and smite him on the helm that hi sword go unto hi teeth and the knight sink down to the earth dead and anon arthur take the horse by the rein and lead him unto king ban and say fair brother have this horse for he have great myster thereof and me repenteth sore of your great damage it shall be soon revenge say king ban for i trust in god mine ure be not such but some of them may sore repent this i will well say arthur for i see your deed full actual nevertheless i might not come at you at that time but when king ban be mount on horseback then there begin new battle the which be sore and hard and pass great slaughter and so through great force king arthur king ban and king bors make their knight a little to withdraw them but alway the eleven king with their chivalry never turn back and so withdraw them to a little wood and so over a little river and there they rest them for on the night they might have no rest on the field and then the eleven king and knight put them on a heap all together a men adread and out of all comfort but there be no man might pass them they hold them so hard together both behind and before that king arthur have marvel of their deed of arm and be pass wroth ah sir arthur say king ban and king bors blame them not for they do as good men ought to do for by my faith say king ban they be the best fight men and knight of most prowess that ever i saw or heard speak of and those eleven king be men of great worship and if they be long unto you there be no king under the heaven have such eleven knight and of such worship i may not love them say arthur they would destroy me that wot we well say king ban and king bors for they be your mortal enemy and that hath be prove aforehand and this day they have do their part and that be great pity of their wilfulness then all the eleven king draw them together and then say king lot lord ye must other way than ye do or els the great loss be behind ye may see what people we have lose and what good men we lose because we wait always on these footman and ever in save of one of the footman we lose ten horseman for him therefore this be mine advice let u put our footman from u for it be near night for the noble arthur will not tarry on the footman for they may save themselves the wood be near hand and when we horsemen be together look every each of you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death and who that seeth any man dress him to flee lightly that he be slay for it be well that we slay a coward than through a coward all we to be slain how say ye say king lot answer me all ye king it be well say quoth king nentres so say the king of the hundred knight the same say the king carados and king uriens so do king idres and king brandegoris and so do king cradelment and the duke of cambenet the same say king clariance and king agwisance and sware they would never fail other neither for life nor for death and whoso that flee but do a they do should be slay then they amend their harness and right their shield and take new spear and set them on their thigh and stood still a it have be a plump of wood when sir arthur and king ban and bors behold them and all their knight they praise them much for their noble cheer of chivalry for the hardy fighter that ever they hear or saw with that there dress them a forty noble knight and say unto the three king they would break their battle these be their name lionses phariance ulfius brastias ector kay lucas the butler griflet le fise de dieu mariet de la roche guinas de bloi briant de la forest savage bellaus morians of the castle maiden flannedrius of the castle of lady annecians that be king bors godson a noble knight ladinas de la rouse emerause caulas graciens le castlein one blois de la case and sir colgrevaunce de gorre all these knight rode on afore with spear on their thigh and spur their horse mightily a the horse might run and the eleven king with part of their knight rush with their horse a fast a they might with their spear and there they do on both party marvellous deed of arm so come into the thick of the press arthur ban and bors and slew down right on both hand that their horse go in blood up to the fetlock but ever the eleven king and their host be ever in the visage of arthur wherefore ban and bors have great marvel consider the great slaughter that there be but at the last they be drive aback over a little river with that come merlin on a great black horse and say unto arthur thou hast never do hast thou not do enough of three score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand and it be time to say ho for god be wroth with thee that thou wilt never have do for yonder eleven king at this time will not be overthrow but an thou tarry on them any longer thy fortune will turn and they shall increase and therefore withdraw you unto your lodging and rest you as soon a ye may and reward your good knight with gold and with silver for they have well deserve it there may no rich be too dear for them for of so few men a ye have there be never men do more of prowess than they have do today for ye have match this day with the best fighter of the world that be truth say king ban and bors also say merlin withdraw you where ye list for this three year i dare undertake they shall not dere you and by then ye shall hear new tidings and then merlin say unto arthur these eleven king have more on hand than they be ware of for the saracen be land in their country more than forty thousand that burn and slay and have lay siege at the castle wandesborow and make great destruction therefore dread you not this three year also sir all the good that be get at this battle let it be search and when ye have it in your hand let it be give freely unto these two king ban and bors that they may reward their knight withal and that shall cause stranger to be of good will to do you service at need also you be able to reward your own knight of your own good whensomever it liketh you it be well say quoth arthur and a thou hast devise so shall it be do when it be deliver to ban and bors they give the good a freely to their knight as freely a it be give to them then merlin take hi leave of arthur and of the two king for to go and see hi master bleise that dwell in northumberland and so he depart and come to hi master that be pass glad of hi come and there he tell how arthur and the two king have speed at the great battle and how it be end and tell the name of every king and knight of worship that be there and so bleise write the battle word by word a merlin tell him how it begin and

disguised that king arthur know him not for he be all befurred in black sheepskin and a great pair of boot and a bow and arrows in a russet gown and bring wild goose in hi hand and it be on the morn after candlemas day but king arthur know him not sir say merlin unto the king will ye give me a gift wherefore say king arthur should i give thee a gift churl sir say merlin ye be good to give me a gift that be not in your hand than to lose great rich for here in the same place where the great battle be be great treasure hid in the earth who tell thee so churl say arthur merlin tell me so say he then ulfius and brastias know him well enough and smile sir say these two knight it be merlin that so speaketh unto you then king arthur be greatly abash and have marvel of merlin and so have king ban and king bors and so they have great disport at him so in the meanwhile there come a damosel that be an earls daughter hi name be sanam and her name be lionors a passing fair damosel and so she come

might prove thee whether thou be good on horseback or i well say the knight seek me here when thou wilt and here nigh this well thou shalt find me and so pass on hi way then the king sit in a study and bid hi men fetch hi horse as fast a ever they might right so come by him merlin like a child of fourteen year of age and salute the king and ask him why he be so pensive i may well be pensive say the king for i have see the marvellest sight that ever i saw that know i well say merlin as well a thyself and of all thy thought but thou art but a fool to take thought for it will not amend thee

for he weened he have slay him and then he unlace hi helm and gat him wind and so with the truncheon he set him on hi horse and so betook him to god and say he have a mighty heart and if he might live

hi sword and say i will assay thee sir knight on foot for i have lose the honour on horseback i will be on horseback say the knight then be arthur wroth and dress hi shield toward him with hi sword drawn when the knight saw that he alight for him think no worship to have a knight at such avail he to be on horseback and he on foot and so he alight and dress hi shield unto arthur and there begin a strong battle with many great stroke and so hew with their sword that the cantels fly in the field and much blood they bleed both that all the place there a they fight be overbled with blood and thus they fight long and rest them and then they go to the battle again and so hurtled together like two ram that either fell to the earth so at the last they smite together that both their sword meet even together but the sword of the knight smote king arthur sword in two piece wherefore he be heavy then say the knight unto arthur thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee and but thou yield thee a overcome and recreant thou shalt die a for death say king arthur welcome be it when it cometh but to yield me unto thee a recreant i have liefer die than to be so shamed and therewithal the king leapt unto pellinore and take him by the middle and throw him down and race off hi helm when the knight felt that he be adread for he be a passing big man of might and anon he bring arthur under him and race off hi helm and would have smite off hi head therewithal come merlin and say knight hold thy hand for an thou slay that knight thou puttest this realm in the great damage that ever be realm for this knight be a man of more worship than thou wotest of why who be he say the knight it be king arthur then would he have slay him for dread of hi wrath and heave up hi sword and therewith merlin cast an enchantment to the knight that he fell to the earth in a great sleep then merlin take up king arthur and ride forth on the knight horse ala say arthur what hast thou do merlin hast thou slain this good knight by thy craft there liveth not so worshipful a knight a he be i have liefer than the stint of my land a year that he be alive care ye not say merlin for he be whole than ye for he be but asleep and will awake within three hour i tell you say merlin what a knight he be here have ye be slay have i not be also there liveth not a big knight than he be one and he shall hereafter do you right good service and hi name be pellinore and he shall have two son that shall be pass good men save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good living and their name shall be percivale of wale and lamerake of wale and he shall tell you the name of your own son begotten of your sister that shall be the destruction of all this realm right so the king and he depart and go unto an hermit that be a good man and a great leech so the hermit search all hi wound and give him good salve so the king be there three day and then be hi wound well amend that he might ride and go and so departed and a they ride arthur say i have no sword no force say merlin hereby be a sword that shall be yours an i may so they ride till they come to a lake the which be a fair water and broad and in the midst of the lake arthur be ware of an arm clothe in white samite that hold a fair sword in that hand lo say merlin yonder be that sword that i spake of with that they saw a damosel go upon the lake what damosel be that say arthur that be the lady of the lake say merlin and within that lake be a rock and therein be a fair a place a any on earth and richly beseen and this damosel will come to you anon and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword anon withal come the damosel unto arthur and salute him and he her again damosel say arthur what sword be that that yonder the arm holdeth above the water i would it be mine for i have no sword sir arthur king say the damosel that sword be mine and if ye will give me a gift when i ask it you ye shall have it by my faith say arthur i will give you what gift ye will ask well say the damosel go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword and take it and the scabbard with you and i will ask my gift when i see my time so sir arthur and merlin alight and tie their horse to two tree and so they go into the ship and when they come to the sword that the hand hold sir arthur take it up by the handle and take it with him and the arm and the hand go under the water and so they come unto the land and ride forth and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion what signifieth yonder pavilion it be the knight pavilion say merlin that ye fought with last sir pellinore but he be out he be not there he hath ado with a knight of yours that hight egglame and they have foughten together but at the last egglame flee and els he have be dead and he hath chase him even to carlion and we shall meet with him anon in the highway that be well say say arthur now have i a sword now will i wage battle with him and be avenge on him sir you shall not so say merlin for the knight be weary of fight and chase so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him also he will not be lightly match of one knight living and therefore it be my counsel let him pass for he shall do you good service in short time and hi son after hi day also ye shall see that day in short space you shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed when i see him i will do a ye advise say arthur then sir arthur look on the sword and like it pass well whether liketh you good say merlin the sword or the scabbard me liketh good the sword say arthur ye be more unwise say merlin for the scabbard be worth ten of the sword for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood be ye never so sore wounded therefore keep well the scabbard always with you so they ride unto carlion and by the way they meet with sir pellinore but merlin have do such a craft that pellinore saw not arthur and he pass by without any word i marvel say arthur that the knight would not speak sir say merlin he saw you not for an he have see you ye have not lightly depart so they come unto carlion whereof hi knight be pass glad and when they hear of hi adventure they marvel that he would jeopard hi person so alone but all men of worship say it be merry to be under such a chieftain that would put hi person in adventure a other poor knight do this meanwhile come a messenger from king rience of north wale and king he be of all ireland and of many isle and this be hi message greet well king arthur in this manner wise say that king rience have discomfit and overcome eleven king and everych of them do him homage and that be this they give him their beard clean flay off as much a there be wherefore the messenger come for king arthur beard for king rience have purfled a mantle with king beard and there lack one place of the mantle wherefore he send for hi beard or els he would enter into hi land and burn and slay and never leave till he have the head and the beard well say arthur thou hast say thy message the which be the most villainous and lewd message that ever man heard send unto a king also thou mayest see my beard be full young yet to make a purfle of it but tell thou thy king this i owe him none homage nor none of mine elder but or it be long to he shall do me homage on both hi knee or els he shall lose hi head by the faith of my body for this be the most shameful message that ever i hear speak of i have espy thy king meet never yet with worshipful man but tell him i will have hi head without he do me homage then the messenger depart now be there any here say arthur that knoweth king rience then answer a knight that hight naram sir i know the king well he be a passing good man of hi body a few be live and a passing proud man and sir doubt ye not he will make war on you with a mighty puissance well say arthur i shall ordain for him in short time then king arthur let send for all the child bear on mayday begotten of lord and born of lady for merlin tell king arthur that he that should destroy him should be bear on mayday wherefore he send for them all upon pain of death and so there be find many lord son and all be send unto the king and so be mordred send by king lot wife and all be put in a ship to the sea and some be four week old and some less and so by fortune the ship drave unto a castle and be all toriven and destroy the most part save that mordred be cast up and a good man find him and nourish him till he be fourteen year old and then he bring him to the court a it rehearseth afterward toward the end of the death of arthur so many lord and baron of this realm be displease for their child be so lose and many put the wite on merlin more than on arthur so what for dread and for love they hold their peace but when the messenger come to king rience then be he wood out of measure and purvey him for a great host a it rehearseth after in the book of balin le savage that followeth next
