shield and draw hi sword and would have do battle to the utterance for he be wood wroth not so say sir bleoberis de ganis a at this time i will not fight upon foot then the damosel maledisant rebuke him in the foul manner and bid him turn again coward ah damosel he say i pray you of mercy to missay me no more my grief be enough though ye give me no more i call myself never the bad knight when a mare son faileth me and also i count me never the bad knight for a fall of sir bleoberis so thus he ride with her two day and by fortune there come sir palomides and encounter with him and he in the same wise serve him a do bleoberis toforehand what dost thou here in my fellowship say the damosel maledisant thou canst not sit no knight nor withstand him one buffet but if it be sir dagonet ah fair damosel i be not the bad to take a fall of sir palomides and yet great disworship have i none for neither bleoberis nor yet palomides would not fight with me on foot a for that say the damosel wit thou well they have disdain and scorn to light off their horse to fight with such a lewd knight a thou art so in the meanwhile there come sir mordred sir gawain brother and so he fell in the fellowship with the damosel maledisant and then they come afore the castle orgulous and there be such a custom that there might no knight come by that castle but either he must joust or be prisoner or at the least to lose hi horse and hi harness and there come out two knight against them and sir mordred joust with the foremost and that knight of the castle smote sir mordred down off hi horse and then la cote male tail joust with that other and either of them smite other down horse and all to the earth and when they avoid their horse then either of them take other horse and then la cote male tail ride unto that knight that smite down sir mordred and joust with him and there sir la cote male tail hurt and wound him pass sore and put him from hi horse a he have be dead so he turn unto him that meet him afore and he take the flight towards the castle and sir la cote male tail rode after him into the castle orgulous and there la cote male tail slew him and anon there come an hundred knight about him and assail him and when he saw hi horse should be slay he alight and void hi horse and put the bridle under hi foot and so put him out of the gate and when he have so do he hurl in among them and dress hi back unto a lady chamberwall think himself that he have liefer die there with worship than to abide the rebuke of the damosel maledisant and in the meantime a he stand and fight that lady whose be the chamber go out slily at her postern and without the gate she find la cote male tailes horse and lightly she gat him by the bridle and tie him to the postern and then she go unto her chamber slily again for to behold how that one knight fought against an hundred knight and when she have behold him long she go to a window behind hi back and say thou knight thou fightest wonderly well but for all that at the last thou must need die but an thou canst through thy mighty prowess win unto yonder postern for there have i fasten thy horse to abide thee but wit thou well thou must think on thy worship and think not to die for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and mightily when la cote male tail hear her say so he grip hi sword in hi hand and put hi shield fair afore him and through the thick press he thrulled through them and when he come to the postern he find there ready four knight and at two the first stroke he slew two of the knight and the other fled and so he win hi horse and rode from them and all a it be it be rehearse in king arthur court how he slew twelve knight within the castle orgulous and so he ride on hi way and in the meanwhile the damosel say to sir mordred i ween my foolish knight be either slay or take prisoner then be they ware where he come rid and when he be come unto them he tell all how he have speed and escape in despite of them all and some of the best of them will tell no tale thou li falsely say the damosel that dare i make good but a a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee pas that may ye prove say la cote male tail with that she send a courier of hers that ride alway with her for to know the truth of this deed and so he ride thither lightly and ask how and in what manner that la cote male tail be escape out of the castle then all the knight curse him and say that he be a fiend and no man for he hath slain here twelve of our best knight and we weened unto this day that it have be too much for sir launcelot du lake or for sir tristram de lion and in despite of u all he be depart from u and maugre our head with this answer the courier depart and come to maledisant hi lady and tell her all how sir la cote male tail have speed at the castle orgulous then she smite down her head and say little by my head say sir mordred to the damosel ye be greatly to blame so to rebuke him for i warn you plainly he be a good knight and i doubt not but he shall prove a noble knight but a yet he may not yet sit sure on horseback for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage and exercise but when he cometh to the stroke of hi sword he be then noble and mighty and that saw sir bleoberis and sir palomides for wit ye well they be wily men of arm and anon they know when they see a young knight by hi rid how they be sure to give him a fall from hi horse or a great buffet but for the most part they will not light on foot with young knight for they be wight and strongly arm for in likewise sir launcelot du lake when he be first make knight he be often put to the bad upon horseback but ever upon foot he recover hi renown and slew and defoiled many knight of the round table and therefore the rebuke that sir launcelot do unto many knight causeth them that be men of prowess to beware for often i have see the old proved knight rebuke and slay by them that be but young beginner thus they ride sure talk by the way together here leave we off a while of this tale and speak we of sir launcelot du lake that when he be come to the court of king arthur then hear he tell of the young knight la cote male tail how he slew the lion and how he take upon him the adventure of the black shield the which be name at that time the hardy adventure of the world so god me save say sir launcelot unto many of hi fellow it be shame to all the noble knight to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon him for hi destruction for i will that ye wit say sir launcelot that that damosel maledisant hath borne that shield many a day for to seek the most proved knight and that be she that breuse saunce pite take that shield from her and after tristram de lion rescue that shield from him and give it to the damosel again a little afore that time that sir tristram fought with my nephew sir blamore de ganis for a quarrel that be betwixt the king of ireland and him then many knight be sorry that sir la cote male tail be go forth to that adventure truly say sir launcelot i cast me to ride after him and within seven day sir launcelot overtook la cote male tail and then he salute him and the damosel maledisant and when sir mordred saw sir launcelot then he leave their fellowship and so sir launcelot rode with them all a day and ever that damosel rebuke la cote male tail and then sir launcelot answer for him then she leave off and rebuke sir launcelot so this meantime sir tristram send by a damosel a letter unto sir launcelot excuse him of the wedding of isoud la blanch main and say in the letter a he be a true knight he have never ado fleshly with isoud la blanch main and pass courteously and gentily sir tristram write unto sir launcelot ever beseech him to be hi good friend and unto la beale isoud of cornwall and that sir launcelot would excuse him if that ever he saw her and within short time by the grace of god say sir tristram that he would speak with la beale isoud and with him right hastily then sir launcelot depart from the damosel and from sir la cote male tail for to oversee that letter and to write another letter unto sir tristram de lion and in the meanwhile la cote male tail rode with the damosel until they come to a castle that hight pendragon and there be six knight stand afore him and one of them proffer to joust with la cote male tail and there la cote male tail smite him over hi horse croup and then the five knight set upon him all at once with their spear and there they smite la cote male tail down horse and man and then they alight suddenly and set their hand upon him all at once and take him prisoner and so lead him unto the castle and keep him a prisoner and on the morn sir launcelot arise and deliver the damosel with letter unto sir tristram and then he take hi way after la cote male tail and by the way upon a bridge there be a knight proffer sir launcelot to joust and sir launcelot smite him down and then they fight upon foot a noble battle together and a mighty and at the last sir launcelot smite him down grovel upon hi hand and hi knee and then that knight yield him and sir launcelot receive him fair sir say the knight i require thee tell me your name for much my heart giveth unto you nay say sir launcelot a at this time i will not tell you my name unless then that ye tell me your name certainly say the knight my name be sir nerovens that be make knight of my lord sir launcelot du lake ah nerovens de lile say sir launcelot i be right glad that ye be prove a good knight for now wit ye well my name be sir launcelot du lake ala say sir nerovens de lile what have i do and therewithal flatling he fell to hi foot and would have kiss them but sir launcelot would not let him and then either make great joy of other and then sir nerovens tell sir launcelot that he should not go by the castle of pendragon for there be a lord a mighty knight and many knight with him and this night i hear say that they take a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel and they say he be a knight of the round table ah say sir launcelot that knight be my fellow and him shall i rescue or els i shall lose my life therefore and therewithal he ride fast till he come before the castle of pendragon and anon therewithal there come six knight and all make them ready to set upon sir launcelot at once then sir launcelot feutred hi spear and smite the foremost that he brake hi back insunder and three of them hit and three fail and then sir launcelot pass through them and lightly he turn in again and smite another knight through the breast and throughout the back more than an ell and therewithal hi spear brake so then all the remnant of the four knight draw their sword and lash at sir launcelot and at every stroke sir launcelot bestow so hi stroke that at four stroke sundry they avoid their saddle pass sore wound and forthwith he ride hurl into that castle and anon the lord of the castle that be that time cleped sir brian de le isle the which be a noble man and a great enemy unto king arthur within a while he be arm and upon horseback and then they feutred their spear and hurl together so strongly that both their horse rash to the earth and then they avoid their saddle and dress their shield and draw their sword and flang together a wood men and there be many stroke give in a while at the last sir launcelot give to sir brian such a buffet that he kneel upon hi knee and then sir launcelot rash upon him and with great force he pull off hi helm and when sir brian saw that he should be slay he yield him and put him in hi mercy and in hi grace then sir launcelot make him to deliver all hi prisoner that he have within hi castle and therein sir launcelot find of arthur knight thirty and forty lady and so he deliver them and then he ride hi way and anon a la cote male tail be deliver he gat hi horse and hi harness and hi damosel maledisant the meanwhile sir nerovens that sir launcelot have foughten withal afore at the bridge he send a damosel after sir launcelot to wit how he speed at the castle of pendragon and then they within the castle marvel what knight he be when sir brian and hi knight deliver all those prisoner have ye no marvel say the damosel for the best knight in this world be here and do this journey and wit ye well she say it be sir launcelot then be sir brian full glad and so be hi lady and all hi knight that such a man should win them and when the damosel and la cote male tail understand that it be sir launcelot du lake that have ride with them in fellowship and that she remember her how she have rebuke him and call him coward then be she pass heavy so then they take their horse and ride forth a pace after sir launcelot and within two mile they overtake him and salute him and thank him and the damosel cry sir launcelot mercy of her evil deed and say for now i know the flower of all knighthood be depart even between sir tristram and you for god knoweth say the damosel that i have seek you my lord sir launcelot and sir tristram long and now i thank god i have meet with you and once at camelot i meet with sir tristram and there he rescue this black shield with the white hand hold a naked sword that sir breuse saunce pite have take from me now fair damosel say sir launcelot who tell you my name sir say she there come a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at the bridge and she tell me your name be sir launcelot du lake blame have she then say sir launcelot but her lord sir nerovens hath tell her but damosel say sir launcelot upon this covenant i will ride with you so that ye will not rebuke this knight sir la cote male tail no more for he be a good knight and i doubt not he shall prove a noble knight and for hi sake and pity that he should not be destroy i follow him to succour him in this great need ah jesu thank you say the damosel for now i will say unto you and to him both i rebuke him never for no hate that i hat him but for great love that i have to him for ever i suppose that he have be too young and too tender to take upon him these adventure and therefore by my will i would have drive him away for jealousy that i have of hi life for it may be no young knight deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end pardieu say sir launcelot it be well say and where ye be call the damosel maledisant i will call you the damosel bienpensant and so they ride forth a great while unto they come to the border of the country of surluse and there they find a fair village with a strong bridge like a fortress and when sir launcelot and they be at the bridge there stert forth afore them of gentleman and yeoman many that say fair lord ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress because of that black shield that i see one of you bear and therefore there shall not pass but one of you at once therefore choose you which of you shall enter within this bridge first then sir launcelot proffer himself first to enter within this bridge sir say la cote male tail i beseech you let me enter within this fortress and if i may speed well i will send for you and if it happen that i be slay there it goeth and if so be that i be a prisoner take then may ye rescue me i be loath say sir launcelot to let you pass this passage sir say la cote male tail i

sir ye be the man in the world except sir tristram that i be most loath to have ado withal but an ye will need fight with me i shall endure you as long a i may then spake sir bleoberis and say my lord sir launcelot i wist you never so misadvised a ye be now for sir lamorak sayeth you but reason and knightly for i warn you i have a lady and methinketh that she be the fair lady of the world were this

good friend then sir launcelot say unto sir lamorak i pray you forgive me mine evil will and if i be misadvise i will amend it sir say sir lamorak the amends be soon make betwixt you and me and so sir launcelot and sir bleoberis depart and sir meliagaunce and sir lamorak take their horse and either depart from other and within a while come king arthur and meet with sir lamorak and joust with him and there he smite down sir lamorak and wound him sore with a spear and so he ride from him wherefore sir lamorak be wroth that he would not fight with him on foot howbeit that sir lamorak know not king arthur now leave we of this tale and speak we of sir tristram that a he ride he meet with sir kay the seneschal and there sir kay ask sir tristram of what country he be he answer that he be of the country of cornwall it may well be say sir kay for yet hear i never that ever good knight come out of cornwall that be evil spoken say sir tristram but an it please you to tell me your name i require you sir wit ye well say sir kay that my name be sir kay the seneschal be that your name say sir tristram now wit ye well that ye be name the shamefullest knight of your tongue that now be live howbeit ye be call a good knight but ye be call unfortunate and pass overthwart of your tongue and thus they ride together till they come to a bridge and there be a knight would not let them pass till one of them joust with him and so that knight joust with sir kay and there that knight give sir kay a fall hi name be sir tor sir lamoraks halfbrother and then they two rode to their lodging and there they find sir brandiles and sir tor come thither anon after and a they sit at supper these four knight three of them spake all shame by cornish knight sir tristram hear all that they say and he say but little but he think the more but at that time he discover not hi name upon the morn sir tristram take hi horse and abide them upon their way and there sir brandiles proffer to joust with sir tristram and sir tristram smite him down horse and all to the earth then sir tor le fise de vayshoure encounter with sir tristram and there sir tristram smite him down and then he ride hi way and sir kay follow him but he would not of hi fellowship then sir brandiles come to sir kay and say i would wit fain what be that knight name come on with me say sir kay and we shall pray him to tell u hi name so they ride together till they come nigh him and then they be ware where he sit by a well and have put off hi helm to drink at the well and when he saw them come he lace on hi helm lightly and take hi horse and proffer them to joust nay say sir brandiles we joust late enough with you we come not in that intent but for this we come to require you of knighthood to tell u your name my fair knight sithen that be your desire and to please you ye shall wit that my name be sir tristram de lion nephew unto king mark of cornwall in good time say sir brandiles and well be ye find and wit ye well that we be right glad that we have find you and we be of a fellowship that would be right glad of your company for ye be the knight in the world that the noble fellowship of the round table most desireth to have the company of god thank them say sir tristram of their great goodness but a yet i feel well that i be unable to be of their fellowship for i be never yet of such deed of worthiness to be in the company of such a fellowship ah say sir kay an ye be sir tristram de lion ye be the man call now most of prowess except sir launcelot du lake for he beareth not the life christian nor heathen that can find such another knight to speak of hi prowess and of hi hand and hi truth withal for yet could there never creature say of him dishonour and make it good thus they talk a great while and then they depart either from other such way a them seem best now shall ye hear what be the cause that king arthur come into the forest perilous that be in north wale by the mean of a lady her name be annowre and this lady come to king arthur at cardiff and she by fair promise and fair behest make king arthur to ride with her into that forest perilous and she be a great sorceress and many day she have love king arthur and because she would have him to lie by her she come into that country so when the king be go with her many of hi knight follow after king arthur when they miss him a sir launcelot brandiles and many other and when she have bring him to her tower she desire him to lie by her and then the king remember him of hi lady and would not lie by her for no craft that she could do then every day she would make him ride into that forest with hi own knight to the intent to have have king arthur slain for when this lady annowre saw that she might not have him at her will then she labour by false mean to have destroy king arthur and slay then the lady of the lake that be alway friendly to king arthur she understood by her subtle craft that king arthur be like to be destroy and therefore this lady of the lake that hight nimue come into that forest to seek after sir launcelot du lake or sir tristram for to help king arthur fora that same day this lady of the lake know well that king arthur should be slain unless that he have help of one of these two knight and thus she ride up and down till she meet with sir tristram and anon a she saw him she know him o my lord sir tristram she say well be ye met and bless be the time that i have meet with you for this same day and within these two hour shall be do the foul deed that ever be do in this land o fair damosel say sir tristram may i amend it come on with me she say and that in all the haste ye may for ye shall see the most worshipfullest knight of the world hard bestead then say sir tristram i be ready to help such a noble man he be neither good nor bad say the lady of the lake but the noble king arthur himself god defend say sir tristram that ever he should be in such distress then they ride together a great pace until they come to a little turret or castle and underneath that castle they saw a knight stand upon foot fight with two knight and so sir tristram behold them and at the last the two knight smite down the one knight and that one of them unlace hi helm to have slay him and the lady annowre gat king arthur sword in her hand to have stricken off hi head and therewithal come sir tristram with all hi might cry traitress traitress leave that and anon there sir tristram smite the one of the knight through the body that he fell dead and then he rash to the other and smite hi back asunder and in the meanwhile the lady of the lake cry to king arthur let not that false lady escape then king arthur overtake her and with the same sword he smite off her head and the lady of the lake take up her head and hung it up by the hair of her saddlebow and then sir tristram horse king arthur and ride forth with him but he charge the lady of the lake not to discover hi name a at that time when the king be horse he thank heartily sir tristram and desire to wit hi name but he would not tell him but that he be a poor knight adventurous and so he bare king arthur fellowship till he meet with some of hi knight and within a while he meet with sir ector de mari and he know not king arthur nor sir tristram and he desire to joust with one of them then sir tristram rode unto sir ector and smite him from hi horse and when he have do so he come again to the king and say my lord yonder be one of your knight he may bare you fellowship and another day that deed that i have do for you i trust to god ye shall understand that i would do you service ala say king arthur let me wit what ye be not at this time say sir tristram so he depart and leave king arthur and sir ector together and then at a day set sir tristram and sir lamorak meet at the well and then they take kehydius at the forester house and so they ride with him to the ship where they leave dame bragwaine and gouvernail and so they sail into cornwall all wholly together and by assent and information of dame bragwaine when they be land they ride unto sir dinas the seneschal a trusty friend of sir tristram and so dame bragwaine and sir dinas rode to the court of king mark and tell the queen la beale isoud that sir tristram be nigh her in that country then for very pure joy la beale isoud swoon and when she might speak she say gentle knight seneschal help that i might speak with him outher my heart will brast then sir dinas and dame bragwaine bring sir tristram and kehydius privily unto the court unto a chamber whereas la beale isoud have assign it and to tell the joy that be betwixt la beale isoud and sir tristram there be no tongue can tell it nor heart think it nor pen write it and a the french book maketh mention at the first time that ever sir kehydius saw la beale isoud he be so enamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never withdraw it and at the last a ye shall hear or the book be end sir kehydius die for the love of la beale isoud and then privily he write unto her letter and ballad of the most goodly that be use in those day and when la beale isoud understand hi letter she have pity of hi complaint and unavised she write another letter to comfort him withal and sir tristram be all this while in a turret at the commandment of la beale isoud and when she might she come unto sir tristram so on a day king mark play at the chess under a chamber window and at that time sir tristram and sir kehydius be within the chamber over king mark and a it mishap sir tristram find the letter that kehydius send unto la beale isoud also he have find the letter that she write unto kehydius and at that same time la beale isoud be in the same chamber then sir tristram come unto la beale isoud and say madam here be a letter that be send unto you and here be the letter that ye send unto him that send you that letter ala madam the good love that i have love you and many land and rich have i forsake for your love and now ye be a traitress to me the which doth me great pain but a for thee sir kehydius i bring thee out of brittany into this country and thy father king howel i win hi land howbeit i wed thy sister isoud la blanch main for the goodness she do unto me and yet a i be true knight she be a clean maiden for me but wit thou well sir kehydius for this falsehood and treason thou hast do me i will revenge it upon thee and therewithal sir tristram draw out hi sword and say sir kehydius keep thee and then la beale isoud swoon to the earth and when sir kehydius saw sir tristram come upon him he saw none other boot but leap out at a baywindow even over the head where sat king mark playing at the chess and when the king saw one come hurling over hi head he say fellow what art thou and what be the cause thou leapest out at that window my lord the king say kehydius it fortuned me that i be asleep in the window above your head and a i sleep i slumber and so i fell down and thus sir kehydius excuse him then sir tristram dread sore l he be discover unto the king that he be there wherefore he draw him to the strength of the tower and arm him in such armour a he have for to fight with them that would withstand him and so when sir tristram saw there be no resistance against him he send gouvernail for hi horse and hi spear and knightly he ride forth out of the castle openly that be call the castle of tintagil and even at gate he meet with gingalin sir gawain son and anon sir gingalin put hi spear in hi rest and run upon sir tristram and brake hi spear and sir tristram at that time have but a sword and give him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell down from hi saddle and hi sword slide adown and carve asunder hi horse neck and so sir tristram ride hi way into the forest and all this do saw king mark and then he send a squire unto the hurt knight and command him to come to him and so he do and when king mark wist that it be sir gingalin he welcome him and give him an horse and ask him what knight it be that have encounter with him sir say gingalin i wot not what knight he be but well i wot that he sigheth and maketh great dole then sir tristram within a while meet with a knight of hi own that hight sir fergus and when he have meet with him he make great sorrow insomuch that he fell down off hi horse in a swoon and in such sorrow he be in three day and three night then at the last sir tristram send unto the court by sir fergus for to spere what tidings and so a he ride by the way he meet with a damosel that come from sir palomides to know and seek how sir tristram do then sir fergus tell her how he be almost out of hi mind ala say the damosel where shall i find him in such a place say sir fergus then sir fergus find queen isoud sick in her bed make the great dole that ever any earthly woman make and when the damosel find sir tristram she make great dole because she might not amend him for the more she make of him the more be hi pain and at the last sir tristram take hi horse and ride away from her and then be it three day or that she could find him and then she bring him meat and drink but he would none and then another time sir tristram escape away from the damosel and it hap him to ride by the same castle where sir palomides and sir tristram do battle when la beale isoud depart them and there by fortune the damosel meet with sir tristram again make the great dole that ever earthly creature make and she yede to the lady of that castle and tell her of the misadventure of sir tristram ala say the lady of that castle where be my lord sir tristram right here by your castle say the damosel in good time say the lady be he so nigh me he shall have meat and drink of the best and an harp i have of hi whereupon he teach me for of goodly harp he beareth the prize in the world so this lady and damosel bring him meat and drink but he eat little thereof then upon a night he put hi horse from him and then he unlace hi armour and then sir tristram would go into the wilderness and brast down the tree and bough and otherwhile when he find the harp that the lady send him then would he harp and play thereupon and weep together and sometime when sir tristram be in the wood that the lady wist not where he be then would she sit her down and play upon that harp then would sir tristram come to that harp and hearken thereto and sometime he would harp himself thus he there endure a quarter of a year then at the last he run hi way and she wist not where he be become and then be he naked and waxed lean and poor of flesh and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherd and daily they would give him some of their meat and drink and when he do any shrewd deed they would beat him with rod and so they clip him with shear and make him like a fool and upon a day dagonet king arthur fool come into cornwall with two squire with him and a they ride through that forest they come by a fair well where sir tristram be wont to be and the weather be hot and they alight to drink of that well and in the meanwhile their horse brake loose right so sir tristram come unto them and first he souse sir dagonet in that well and after hi squire and thereat laugh the shepherd and forthwith he run after their horse and bring them again one by one and right so wet a they be he make them leap up and ride their way thus sir tristram endure there an half year naked and would never come in town nor village the meanwhile the damosel that sir palomides send to seek sir tristram she yede unto sir palomides and tell him all the mischief that sir tristram endure ala say sir palomides it be great pity that ever so noble a knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady but nevertheless i will go and seek him and comfort him an i may then a little before that time la beale isoud have command sir kehydius out of the country of cornwall so sir kehydius depart with a dolorous heart and by adventure he meet with sir palomides and they enfellowshipped together and either complain to other of their hot love that they love la beale isoud now let u say sir palomides seek sir tristram that love her as well a we and let u prove whether we may recover him so they ride into that forest and three day and three night they would never take their lodging but ever seek sir tristram and upon a time by adventure they meet with king mark that be ride from hi men all alone when they saw him sir palomides know him but sir kehydius know him not ah false king say sir palomides it be pity thou hast thy life for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful knight and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroy that most noble knight sir tristram de lion and therefore defend thee say sir palomides for thou shalt die this day that be shame say king mark for ye two be arm and i be unarmed a for that say sir palomides i shall find a remedy therefore here be a knight with me and thou shalt have hi harness nay say king mark i will not have ado with you for cause have ye none to me for all the misease that sir tristram hath be for a letter that he find for a to me i do to him no displeasure and god knoweth i be full sorry for hi disease and malady so when the king have thus excuse him they be friend and king mark would have have them unto tintagil but sir palomides would not but turn unto the realm of logris and sir kehydius say that he would go into brittany now turn we unto sir dagonet again that when he and hi squire be upon horseback he deem that the shepherd have send that fool to array them so because that they laugh at them and so they ride unto the keeper of beast and all tobeat them sir tristram saw them beat that be wont to give him meat and drink then he run thither and gat sir dagonet by the head and give him such a fall to the earth that he bruise him sore so that he lay still and then he wrast hi sword out of hi hand and therewith he run to one of hi squire and smite off hi head and the other fled and so sir tristram take hi way with that sword in hi hand run a he have be wild wood then sir dagonet rode to king mark and tell him how he have speed in that forest and therefore say sir dagonet beware king mark that thou come not about that well in the forest for there be a fool naked and that fool and i fool meet together and he have almost slay me ah say king mark that be sir matto le breune that fell out of hi wit because he lose hi lady for when sir gaheris smite down sir matto and win hi lady of him never since be he in hi mind and that be pity for he be a good knight then sir andred that be cousin unto sir tristram make a lady that be hi paramour to say and to noise it that she be with sir tristram or ever he die and this tale she bring unto king mark court that she bury him by a well and that or he die he beseech king mark to make hi cousin sir andred king of the country of lion of the which sir tristram be lord of all this do sir andred because he would have have sir tristram land and when king mark hear tell that sir tristram be dead he weep and make great dole but when queen isoud heard of these tidings she make such sorrow that she be nigh out of her mind and so upon a day she think to slay herself and never to live after sir tristram death and so upon a day la beale isoud gat a sword privily and bare it to her garden and there she pight the sword through a plum tree up to the hilt so that it stick fast and it stand breast high and a she would have run upon the sword and to have slay herself all this espied king mark how she kneel down and say sweet lord jesu have mercy upon me for i may not live after the death of sir tristram de lion for he be my first love and he shall be the last and with these word come king mark and take her in hi arm and then he take up the sword and bare her away with him into a tower and there he make her to be keep and watch her surely and after that she lay long sick nigh at the point of death this meanwhile run sir tristram naked in the forest with the sword in hi hand and so he come to an hermitage and there he lay him down and slept and in the meanwhile the hermit steal away hi sword and laid meat down by him thus be he keep there ten day and at the last he depart and come to the herdmen again and there be a giant in that country that hight tauleas and for fear of sir tristram more than seven year he durst never much go at large but for the most part he keep him in a sure castle of hi own and so this tauleas heard tell that sir tristram be dead by the noise of the court of king mark then this tauleas go daily at large and so he hap upon a day he come to the herdmen wander and langering and there he set him down to rest among them the meanwhile there come a knight of cornwall that lead a lady with him and hi name be sir dinant and when the giant saw him he go from the herdmen and hide him under a tree and so the knight come to that well and there he alight to repose him and as soon a he be from hi horse this giant tauleas come betwixt this knight and hi horse and take the horse and leapt upon him so forthwith he ride unto sir dinant and take him by the collar and pull him afore him upon hi horse and there would have stricken off hi head then the herdmen say unto sir tristram help yonder knight help ye him say sir tristram we dare not say the herdmen then sir tristram be ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay and so thither he run and take up the sword and strike off sir tauleas head and so he yede hi way to the herdmen then the knight take up the giant head and bare it with him unto king mark and tell him what adventure betid him in the forest and how a naked man rescue him from the grimly giant tauleas where have ye this adventure say king mark forsooth say sir dinant at the fair fountain in your forest where many adventurous knight meet and there be the mad man well say king mark i will see that

knight will favour another and like will draw to like then the king with the hundred knight withdraw hi knight and all this while and long tofore sir launcelot have watch upon sir tristram with a very purpose to have fellowship with him and then suddenly sir tristram sir dinadan and gouvernail hi man ride their way into the forest that no man perceive where they go so then king arthur blow unto lodging and give the king of northgalis the prize because sir tristram be upon hi side then sir launcelot rode here and there so wood a lion that fauted hi fill because he have lose sir tristram and so he return unto king arthur and then in all the field be a noise that with the wind it might be hear two mile thence how the lord and lady cry the knight with the black shield hath win the field ala say king arthur where be that knight become it be shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away from you but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have bring him unto me to the castle of

sore wound and many be whole my fellow say king arthur look that ye be of good cheer for tomorn i will be in the field with you and revenge you of your enemy so that night king arthur and hi knight

country madam she answer i come for none other cause but from my lady la beale isoud to wit of your welfare for in no wise she would not tell the queen that she come for sir tristram sake so this lady dame bragwaine take her leave of queen guenever and she ride after sir tristram and a she ride through the forest she hear a great cry then she command her squire to go into the forest to wit what be that noise and so he come to a well and there he find a knight bounden till a tree cry a he have be wood and hi horse and hi harness standing by him and when he espy that squire therewith he abraid

fountain then sir palomides wail and wrang hi hand and at the last for pure sorrow he run into that fountain over hi belly and seek after hi sword then sir tristram saw that and run upon sir palomides and hold him in hi arm fast what art thou say palomides that holdeth me so i be a man of this forest that would thee none harm ala say sir palomides i may never win worship where sir tristram be for ever where he be an i be there then get i no worship and if he be away for the most part i have the gree unless that sir launcelot be there or sir lamorak then sir palomides say once in ireland sir tristram put me to the bad and another time in cornwall and in other place in this land what would ye do say sir tristram an ye have sir tristram i would fight with him say sir palomides and ease my heart upon him and yet to say thee sooth sir tristram be the gentle knight in this world live what will ye do say sir tristram will ye go with me to your lodge nay say he i will go to the king with

anon hastily he arm him and take hi horse and a great spear in hi hand and say to sir dinadan adieu and ride toward sir palomides a soft pace then when sir palomides saw that he make countenance to amend hi horse but he do it for this cause for he abide sir gaheris that come after him and when he be come he ride toward sir tristram then sir tristram send unto sir palomides and require him to

sir tristram and sir dinadan rode to an old knight place to lodge them and that old knight have five son at the tournament for whom he pray god heartily for their coming home and so a the french book saith they come home all five well beaten and when sir tristram depart into the forest sir launcelot hold alway the stour like hard a a man araged that take no heed to himself and wit ye well there be many a noble knight against him and when king arthur saw sir launcelot do so marvellous deed of arm he then arm him and take hi horse and hi armour and rode into the field to help sir launcelot and so many knight come in with king arthur and to make short tale in conclusion the king of northgalis and the king of the hundred knight be put to the bad and because sir launcelot abode and be the last in the field the prize be give him but sir launcelot would neither for king queen nor knight have the prize but where the cry be cry through the field sir launcelot sir launcelot hath win the field this day sir launcelot let make another cry contrary sir tristram hath win the field for he begin first and last he hath endured and so hath he do the first day the second and the third day then all the estate and degree high and low say of sir launcelot great worship for the honour that he do unto sir tristram and for that honour do to sir tristram he be at that time more praised and renowned than an he have overthrow five hundred knight and all the people wholly for this gentleness first the estate both high and low and after the commonalty cry at once sir launcelot hath win the field whosoever say nay then be sir launcelot wroth and ashamed and so therewithal he ride to king arthur ala say the king we be all dismayed that sir tristram be thus depart from u by god say king arthur he be one of the noble knight that ever i saw hold spear or sword in hand and the most courteoust knight in hi fighting for full hard i saw him say king arthur when he smite sir palomides upon the helm thrice that he abash hi helm with hi stroke and also he say here be a stroke for sir tristram and thus thrice he say then king arthur sir launcelot and sir dodinas le savage take their horse to seek sir tristram and by the mean of sir persides he have tell king arthur where sir tristram be in hi pavilion but when they come there sir tristram and sir dinadan be go then king arthur and sir launcelot be heavy and return again to the castle of maiden make great dole for the hurt of sir tristram and hi sudden departing so god me help say king arthur i be more heavy that i can not meet with him than for all the hurt that all my knight have have at the tournament right so come sir gaheris and tell king arthur how sir tristram have smite down sir palomides and it be at sir palomides own request ala say king arthur that be great dishonour to sir palomides inasmuch a sir tristram be sore wounded and now may we all king and knight and men of worship say that sir tristram may be call a noble knight and one of the best knight that ever i saw the day of my life for i will that ye all king and knight know say king arthur that i never saw knight do so marvellously a he hath do these three day for he be the first that begin and that long hold on save this last day and though he be hurt it be a manly adventure of two noble knight and when two noble men encounter need must the one have the bad like a god will suffer at that time a for me say sir launcelot for all the land that ever my father leave me i would not have hurt sir tristram an i have know him at that time that i hurt him be for i saw not hi shield for an i have see hi black shield i would not have meddle with him for many cause for late he do as much for me a ever do knight and that be well know that he have ado with thirty knight and no help save sir dinadan and one thing shall i promise say sir launcelot sir palomides shall repent it a in hi unkindly deal for to follow that noble knight that i by mishap hurt thus sir launcelot say all the worship that might be say by sir tristram then king arthur make a great feast to all that would come and thus we let pass king arthur and a little we will turn unto sir palomides that after he have a fall of sir tristram he be nighhand araged out of hi wit for despite of sir tristram and so he follow him by adventure and a he come by a river in hi wood he would have make hi horse to have leap over and the horse fail footing and fell in the river wherefore sir palomides be adread l he should have be drown and then he avoid hi horse and swam to the land and let hi horse go down by adventure and when he come to the land he take off hi harness and sit roaring and cry a a man out of hi mind right so come a damosel even by sir palomides that be send from sir gawain and hi brother unto sir mordred that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where sir tristram be for a the french book saith sir persides hurt so sir mordred a ten day afore and have it hot be for the love of sir gawain and hi brother sir persides have slay sir mordred and so this damosel come by sir palomides and she and he have language together the which please neither of them and so the damosel ride her way till she come to the old knight place and there she tell that old knight how she meet with the woodest knight by adventure that ever she meet withal what bare he in hi shield say sir tristram it be indent with white and black say the damosel ah say sir tristram that be sir palomides the good knight for well i know him say sir tristram for one of the best knight live in this realm then that old knight take a little hackney and rode for sir palomides and bring him unto hi own manor and full well know sir tristram sir palomides but he say but little for at that time sir tristram be walk upon hi foot and well amend of hi hurt and always when sir palomides saw sir tristram he would behold him full marvellously and ever him seem that he have see him then would he say unto sir dinadan an ever i may meet with sir tristram he shall not escape mine hand i marvel say sir dinadan that ye boast behind sir tristram for it be but late that he be in your hand and ye in hi hand why would ye not hold him when ye have him for i saw myself twice or thrice that ye gat but little worship of sir tristram then be sir palomides ashamed so leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old knight sir darras now shall we speak of king arthur that say to sir launcelot had not ye be we have not lose sir tristram for he be here daily unto the time ye meet with him and in an evil time say arthur ye encounter with him my lord arthur say launcelot ye put upon me that i should be cause of hi departition god knoweth it be against my will but when men be hot in deed of arm oft they hurt their friend as well a their foe and my lord say sir launcelot ye shall understand that sir tristram be a man that i be loath to offend for he hath do for me more than ever i do for him a yet but then sir launcelot make bring forth a book and then sir launcelot say here we be ten knight that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where we rest another this twelvemonth until that we find sir tristram and a for me say sir launcelot i promise you upon this book that an i may meet with him either with fairness or foulness i shall bring him to this court or els i shall die therefore and the name of these ten knight that have undertake this quest be these follow first be sir launcelot sir ector de mari sir bors de ganis and bleoberis and sir blamore de ganis and lucan the butler sir uwaine sir galihud lionel and galiodin so these ten noble knight depart from the court of king arthur and so they ride upon their quest together until they come to a cross where depart four way and there depart the fellowship in four to seek sir tristram and a sir launcelot rode by adventure he meet with dame bragwaine that be send into that country to seek sir tristram and she flee as fast a her palfrey might go so sir launcelot meet with her and ask her why she flee ah fair knight say dame bragwaine i flee for dread of my life for here followethme sir breuse saunce pite to slay me hold you nigh me say sir launcelot then when sir launcelot saw sir breuse saunce pite sir launcelot cry unto him and say false knight destroyer of lady and damosel now thy last day be come when sir breuse saunce pite saw sir launcelots shield he know it well for at that time he bare not the arm of cornwall but he bare hi own shield and then sir breuse flee and sir launcelot follow after him but sir breuse be so well horse that when him list to flee he might well flee and also abide when him list and then sir launcelot return unto dame bragwaine and she thank him of hi great labour now will we speak of sir lucan the butler that by fortune he come rid to the same place thereas be sir tristram and in he come in none other intent but to ask harbour then the porter ask what be hi name tell your lord that my name be sir lucan the butler a knight of the round table so the porter go unto sir darras lord of the place and tell him who be there to ask harbour nay nay say sir daname that be nephew to sir darras say him that he shall not be lodge here but let him wit that i sir daname will meet with him anon and bid him make him ready so sir daname come forth on horseback and there they meet together with spear and sir lucan smite down sir daname over hi horse croup and then he flee into that place and sir lucan rode after him and ask after him many time then sir dinadan say to sir tristram it be shame to see the lord cousin of this place defoiled abide say sir tristram and i shall redress it and in the meanwhile sir dinadan be on horseback and he joust with lucan the butler and there sir lucan smote dinadan through the thick of the thigh and so he ride hi way and sir tristram be wroth that sir dinadan be hurt and follow after and think to avenge him and within a while he overtake sir lucan and bid him turn and so they meet together so that sir tristram hurt sir lucan pass sore and give him a fall with that come sir uwaine a gentle knight and when he saw sir lucan so hurt he call sir tristram to joust with him fair knight say sir tristram tell me your name i require you sir knight wit ye well my name be sir uwaine le fise de roy ureine ah say sir tristram by my will i would not have ado with you at no time ye shall not so say sir uwaine but ye shall have ado with me and then sir tristram saw none other bote but rode against him and overthrow sir uwaine and hurt him in the side and so he depart unto hi lodging again and when sir dinadan understand that sir tristram have hurt sir lucan he would have ride after sir lucan for to have slay him but sir tristram would not suffer him then sir uwaine let ordain an horse litter and bring sir lucan to the abbey of ganis and the castle thereby hight the castle of ganis of the which sir bleoberis be lord and at that castle sir launcelot promise all hi fellow to meet in the quest of sir tristram so when sir tristram be come to hi lodge there come a damosel that tell sir darras that three of hi son be slay at that tournament and two grievously wound that they be never like to help themself and all this be do by a noble knight that bare the black shield and that be he that bare the prize then come there one and tell sir darras that the same knight be within him that bare the black shield then sir darras yede unto sir tristram chamber and there he find hi shield and show it to the damosel ah sir say the damosel that same be he that slew your three son then without any tarry sir darras put sir tristram and sir palomides and sir dinadan within a strong prison and there sir tristram be like to have die of great sickness and every day sir palomides would reprove sir tristram of old hate betwixt them and ever sir tristram spake fair and say little but when sir palomides saw the fall of sickness of sir tristram then be he heavy for him and comfort him in all the best wise he could and a the french book saith there come forty knight to sir darras that be of hi own kin and they would have slay sir tristram and hi two fellow but sir darras would not suffer that but keep them in prison and meat and drink they have so sir tristram endure there great pain for sickness have undertake him and that be the great pain a prisoner may have for all the while a prisoner may have hi health of body he may endure under the mercy of god and in hope of good deliverance but when sickness toucheth a prisoner body then may a prisoner say all wealth be him bereft and then he hath cause to wail and to weep right so do sir tristram when sickness have undertake him for then he take such sorrow that he have almost slay himself now will we speak and leave sir tristram sir palomides and sir dinadan in prison and speak we of other knight that seek after sir tristram many diver part of this land and some yede into cornwall and by adventure sir gaheris nephew unto king arthur come unto king mark and there he be well receive and sit at king mark own table and ate of hi own mess then king mark ask sir gaheris what tidings there be in the realm of logris sir say sir gaheris the king reigneth a a noble knight and now but late there be a great joust and tournament a ever i saw any in the realm of logris and the most noble knight be at that joust but there be one knight that do marvellously three day and he bare a black shield and of all knight that ever i saw he prove the best knight then say king mark that be sir launcelot or sir palomides the paynim not so say sir gheris for both sir launcelot and sir palomides be on the contrary party against the knight with the black shield then be it sir tristram say the king yea say sir gaheris and therewithal the king smite down hi head and in hi heart he fear sore that sir tristram should get him such worship in the realm of logris wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him thus sir gaheris have great cheer with king mark and with queen la beale isoud the which be glad of sir gaheris word for well she wist by hi deed and manner that it be sir tristram and then the king make a feast royal and to that feast come sir uwaine le fise de roy ureine and some call him uwaine le blanchemains and this sir uwaine challenge all the knight of cornwall then be the king wood wroth that he have no knight to answer him then sir andred nephew unto king mark leap up and say i will encounter with sir uwaine then he yede and arm him and horse him in the best manner and there sir uwaine meet with sir andred and smite him down that he swoon on the earth then be king mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he have no knight to revenge hi nephew sir andred so the king call unto him sir dinas the seneschal and pray him for hi sake to take upon him to joust with sir uwaine sir say sir dinas i be full loath to have ado with any knight of the round table yet say the king for my love take upon thee to joust so sir dinas make him ready and anon they encounter together with great spear but sir dinas be overthrown horse and man a great fall who be wroth but king mark ala he say have i no knight that will encounter with yonder knight sir say sir gaheris for your sake i will joust so sir gaheris make him ready and when he be arm he ride into the field and when sir uwaine saw sir gaheris shield he ride to him and say sir ye do not your part for sir the first time ye be make knight of the round table ye sware that ye should not have ado with your fellowship wittingly and pardie sir gaheris ye know me well enough by my shield and so do i know you by your shield and though ye would break your oath i would not break mine for there be not one here nor ye that shall think i be afeard of you but i durst right well have ado with you and yet we be sister son then be sir gaheris ashamed and so therewithal every knight go their way and sir uwaine rode into the country then king mark arm him and take hi horse and hi spear with a squire with him and then he ride afore sir uwaine and suddenly at a gap he run upon him a he that be not ware of him and there he smite him almost through the body and there leave him so within a while there come sir kay and find sir uwaine and ask him how he be hurt i wot not say sir uwaine why nor wherefore but by treason i be sure i gat this hurt for here come a knight suddenly upon me or that i be ware and suddenly hurt me then there be come sir andred to seek king mark thou traitor knight say sir kay an i wist it be thou that thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my hand sir say sir andred i do never hurt him and that i will report me to himself fie on you false knight say sir kay for ye of cornwall be nought worth so sir kay make carry sir uwaine to the abbey of the black cross and there he be heal and then sir gaheris take hi leave of king mark but or he depart he say sir king ye do a foul shame unto you and your court when ye banish sir tristram out of this country for ye need not to have doubt no knight an he have be here and so he depart then there come sir kay the seneschal unto king mark and there he have good cheer show outward now fair lord say he will ye prove any adventure in the forest of morris in the which i know well be as hard an adventure a i know any sir say sir kay i will prove it and sir gaheris say he would be avised for king mark be ever full of treason and therewithal sir gaheris depart and ride hi way and by the same way that sir kay should ride he lay him down to rest charge hi squire to wait upon sir kay and warn me when he cometh so within a while sir kay come rid that way and then sir gaheris take hi horse and meet him and say sir kay ye be not wise to ride at the request of king mark for he dealeth all with treason then say sir kay i require you let u prove this adventure i shall not fail you say sir gaheris and so they ride that time till a lake that be that time call the perilous lake and there they abide under the shaw of the wood the meanwhile king mark within the castle of tintagil avoid all hi baron and all other save such a be privy with him be avoid out of hi chamber and then he let call hi nephew sir andred and bid arm him and horse him lightly and by that time it be midnight and so king mark be arm in black horse and all and so at a privy postern they two issue out with their varlet with them and ride till they come to that lake then sir kay espy them first and gat hi spear and proffer to joust and king mark rode against him and smite each other full hard for the moon shone a the bright day and there at that joust sir kays horse fell down for hi horse be not so big a the king horse and sir kays horse bruise him full sore then sir gaheris be wroth that sir kay have a fall then he cry knight sit thou fast in thy saddle for i will revenge my fellow then king mark be afeard of sir gaheris and so with evil will king mark rode against him and sir gaheris give him such a stroke that he fell down so then forthwith sir gaheris run unto sir andred and smite him from hi horse quite that hi helm smote in the earth and nigh have break hi neck and therewithal sir gaheris alight and gat up sir kay and then they yode both on foot to them and bid them yield them and tell their name outher they should die then with great pain sir andred spake first and say it be king mark of cornwall therefore be ye ware what ye do and i be sir andred hi cousin fie on you both say sir gaheris for a false traitor and false treason hast thou wrought and he both under the feigned cheer that ye make u it be pity say sir gaheris that thou shouldst live any long save my life say king mark and i will make amends and consider that i be a king anoint it be the more shame say sir gaheris to save thy life thou art a king anoint with cream and therefore thou shouldst hold with all men of worship and therefore thou art worthy to die with that he lash at king mark without say any more and cover him with hi shield and defend him a he might and then sir kay lash at sir andred and therewithal king mark yield him unto sir gaheris and then he kneel adown and make hi oath upon the cross of the sword that never while he live he would be against errantknights and also he sware to be good friend unto sir tristram if ever he come into cornwall by then sir andred be on the earth and sir kay would have slay him let be say sir gaheris slay him not i pray you it be pity say sir kay that he should live any long for this be nigh cousin unto sir tristram and ever he hath be a traitor unto him and by him he be exile out of cornwall and therefore i will slay him say sir kay ye shall not say sir gaheris sithen i have give the king hi life i pray you give him hi life and therewithal sir kay let him go and so sir kay and sir gaheris ride their way unto dinas the seneschal for because they hear say that he love well sir tristram so they repose them there and soon after they ride unto the realm of logris and so within a little while they meet with sir launcelot that always have dame bragwaine with him to that intent he weened to have meet the sooner with sir tristram and sir launcelot ask what tidings in cornwall and whether they hear of sir tristram or not sir kay and sir gaheris answer and say that they hear not of him then they tell sir launcelot word by word of their adventure then sir launcelot smile and say hard it be to take out of the flesh that be breed in the bone and so make them merry together now leave we off this tale and speak we of sir dinas that have within the castle a paramour and she love another knight well than him and so when sir dinas go out ahunting she slip down by a towel and take with her two brachets and so she yede to the knight that she love and he her again and when sir dinas come home and miss hi paramour and hi brachets then be he the more wrother for hi brachets than for the lady so then he ride after the knight that have hi paramour and bid him turn and joust so sir dinas smote him down that with the fall he brake hi leg and hi arm and then hi lady and paramour cry sir dinas mercy and say she would love him good than ever she do nay say sir dinas i shall never trust them that once betray me and therefore a ye have begin so end for i will never meddle with you and so sir dinas depart and take hi brachets with him and so ride to hi castle now will we turn unto sir launcelot that be right heavy that he could never hear no tidings of sir tristram for all this while he be in prison with sir darras palomides and dinadan then dame bragwaine take her leave to go into cornwall and sir launcelot sir kay and sir gaheris rode to seek sir tristram in the country of surluse now speaketh this tale of sir tristram and of hi two fellow for every day sir palomides brawl and say language against sir tristram i marvel say sir dinadan of thee sir palomides an thou haddest sir tristram here thou wouldst do him no harm for an a wolf and a sheep be together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in peace and wit thou well say sir dinadan this same be sir tristram at a word and now must thou do thy best with him and let see now if ye can skift it with your hand then be sir palomides abash and say little sir palomides then say sir tristram i have hear much of your maugre against me but i will not meddle with you as at this time by my will because i dread the lord of this place that hath u in governance for an i dread him not more than i do thee soon it should be skift so they peaced themself right so come in a damosel and say knight be of good cheer for ye be sure of your life and that i hear say my lord sir darras then be they glad all three for daily they weened they should have die then soon after this sir tristram fell sick that he weened to have die then sir dinadan wept and so do sir palomides under them both make great sorrow so a damosel come in to them and find them mourn then she go unto sir darras and tell him how that mighty knight that bare the black shield be likely to die that shall not be say sir darras for god defend when knight come to me for succour that i should suffer them to die within my prison therefore say sir darras to the damosel fetch that knight and hi fellow afore me and then anon sir darras saw sir tristram bring afore him he say sir knight me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art call a full noble knight and so it seemeth by thee and wit ye well it shall never be say that sir darras shall destroy such a noble knight a thou art in prison howbeit that thou hast slain three of my son whereby i be greatly aggrieve but now shalt thou go and thy fellow and your harness and horse have be fair and clean kept and ye shall go where it liketh you upon this covenant that thou knight wilt promise me to be good friend to my son two that be now alive and also that thou tell me thy name sir say he a for me my name be sir tristram de lion and in cornwall be i bear and nephew i be unto king mark and a for the death of your son i might not do withal for an they have be the next kin that i have i might have do none otherwise and if i have slay them by treason or treachery i have be worthy to have die all this i consider say sir darras that all that ye do be by force of knighthood and that be the cause i would not put you to death but sith ye be sir tristram the good knight i pray you heartily to be my good friend and to my son sir say sir tristram i promise you by the faith of my body ever while i live i will do you service for ye have do to u but a a natural knight ought to do then sir tristram repose him there till that he be amend of hi sickness and when he be big and strong they take their leave and every knight take their horse and so departed and ride together till they come to a cross way now fellows say sir tristram here will we depart in sundry way and because sir dinadan have the first adventure of him i will begin so a sir dinadan rode by a well he find a lady make great dole what aileth you say sir dinadan sir knight say the lady i be the wofullest lady of the world for within these five day here come a knight call sir breuse saunce pite and he slew mine own brother and ever since he hath keep me at hi own will and of all men in the world i hate him most and therefore i require you of knighthood to avenge me for he will not tarry but be here anon let him come say sir dinadan and because of honour of all woman i will do my part with this come sir breuse and when he saw a knight with hi lady he be wood wroth and then he say sir knight keep thee from me so they hurtle together a thunder and either smote other pass sore but sir dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound and or ever sir dinadan might turn him sir breuse be go and flee then the lady pray him to bring her to a castle there beside but four mile thence and so sir dinadan bring her there and she be welcome for the lord of that castle be her uncle and so sir dinadan ride hi way upon hi adventure now turn we this tale unto sir tristram that by adventure he come to a castle to ask lodge wherein be queen morgan le fay and so when sir tristram be let into that castle he have good cheer all that night and upon the morn when he would have depart the queen say wit ye well ye shall not depart lightly for ye be here a a prisoner jesu defend say sir tristram for i be

the other side and ever queen morgan would behold sir tristram and thereat the knight be jealous and be in will suddenly to have run upon sir tristram with a sword but he leave it for shame then the queen say to sir tristram tell me thy name and i shall suffer you to depart when ye will upon that covenant i tell you my name be sir tristram de lion ah say morgan le fay an i have wist that thou shouldst not have depart so soon a thou shalt but sithen i have make a promise i will hold it with that thou wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that i shall deliver thee unto the castle of the

upon both their head i shall tell you say morgan le fay it signifieth king arthur and queen guenever and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and in servage who be that knight say sir tristram that shall ye not wit a at this time say the queen but a the french book saith queen morgan love sir launcelot best and ever she desire him and he would never love her nor do nothing at her request
