devastation and horror lorenzo be shock at have be the cause however innocent of this frightful disturbance he endeavour to repair hi fault by protect the helpless inhabitant of the convent he enter it with the mob and exert himself to repress the prevailing fury till the sudden and alarm progress of the flame compel him to provide for hi own safety the people now hurry out as eagerly a they have before throng in but their number clog up the doorway and the fire gain upon them rapidly many of them perish ere they have time to effect their escape lorenzos good fortune direct him to a small door in a farther aisle of the chapel the bolt be already undrawn he open the door and find himself at the foot of st clares sepulchre here he stop to breathe the duke and some of hi attendant have follow him and thus be in security for the present they now consult what step they should take to escape from this scene of disturbance but their deliberation be considerably interrupt by the sight of volume of fire rise from amidst the convent massy wall by the noise of some heavy arch tumble down in ruin or by the mingled shriek of the nun and rioter either suffocate in the press perishing in the flame or crush beneath the weight of the fall mansion lorenzo enquire whither the wicket lead he be answer to the garden of the capuchin and it be resolve to explore an outlet upon that side accordingly the

without hesitation the other do the same and the whole party soon arrive at the foot of the stair the upper door have be leave open the neighbour flame dart from above a sufficient light to enable lorenzos catch a glance of the fugitive running through the long passage and distant vault but when a sudden turn deprive him of this assistance total darkness succeed and he could only trace the object of hi enquiry by the faint echo of retire foot the pursuer be now compel to proceed with caution as well a they could judge the fugitive also seem to slacken pace for they hear the step follow each other at long interval they at length be bewilder by the labyrinth of passage and disperse in various direction carry away by hi eagerness to clear up this mystery and to penetrate into which he be impel by a movement secret and unaccountable lorenzo heed not this circumstance till he find himself in total solitude the noise of footstep have cease all be silent around and no clue offer itself to guide him to the fly person he stop to reflect on the mean most likely to aid hi pursuit he be persuade that no common cause would have induce the fugitive to seek that dreary place at an hour so unusual the cry which he have hear seem uttered in a voice of terror and he be convince that some mystery be attach to this event after some minute past in hesitation he continue to proceed feel hi way along the wall of the passage he have already past some time in this slow progress when he descry a spark of light glimmer at a distance guide by this observation and have draw hi sword he bend hi step towards the place whence the beam seem to be emit it proceed from the lamp which flame before st clares statue before it stand several female their white garment stream in the blast a it howl along the vaulted dungeon curious to know what have bring them together in this melancholy spot lorenzo draw near with precaution the stranger seem earnestly engage in conversation they hear not

during this conversation the nun have throw themselves into various attitude one knelt and address herself to heaven another hid her face in the lap of her neighbour some listen motionless with fear to the discourse of the suppose assassin while other embrace the statue of st clare and implore her protection with frantic cry on perceive their mistake they crowd round lorenzo and heap benediction on him by dozen he find that on hear the threat of the mob and terrify by the cruelty which from the convent tower they have see inflict on the superior many of the pensioner and nun have take refuge in the sepulchre among the former be to be reckon the lovely virginia nearly relate to the prioress she have more reason than the rest to dread the rioter and now besought lorenzo earnestly not to abandon her to their rage her companion most of whom be woman of noble family make the same request which he readily grant he promise not to quit them till he have see each of them safe in the arm of her relation but he advise their deferring to quit the sepulchre for some time longer when the popular fury should be somewhat calmed and the arrival of military force have disperse the multitude would to god cry virginia that i be already safe in my mother embrace how say you segnor will it be long ere we may leave this place every moment that i pass here i pass in torture i hope not long say

and complain and groan and wail in accent that make my blood run cold christ jesus it be enough to drive me to madness excuse me reply lorenzo if i be surprized that while menace by real woe you be capable of yield to imaginary danger these terror be puerile and groundless combat them holy sister i have promise to guard you from the rioter but against the attack of superstition you must depend for protection upon yourself the idea of ghost be ridiculous in the extreme and if you continue to be sway by ideal terror ideal exclaim the nun with one voice why we hear it ourselves segnor every one of u hear it it be frequently repeat and it sound every time more melancholy and deep you will never persuade me that we could all have be deceive not we indeed no no had the noise be merely create by fancy hark hark interrupt virginia in a voice of terror god preserve u there it be again the nun clasp their hand together and sink upon their knee lorenzo look round him eagerly and be on the point of yield to the fear which already have possess the woman universal silence prevail he examine the vault but nothing be to be see he now prepare to address the nun and ridicule their childish apprehension when hi attention be arrest by a deep and longdrawn groan what be that he cry and start there segnor say helena now you must be convince you have hear the noise yourself now judge whether our terror be imaginary since we have be here that groan have be repeat almost every five minute doubtless it proceed from some soul in pain who wish to be pray out of purgatory but none of u here dare ask it the question a for me be i to see an apparition the fright i be very certain would kill me out of hand a she say this a second groan be hear yet more distinctly the nun cross themselves and hasten to repeat their prayer against evil spirit lorenzo listen attentively he even think that he could distinguish sound a of one speaking in complaint but distance render them inarticulate the noise seem to come from the midst of the small vault in which he and the nun then be and which a multitude of passage branch out in various direction form into a sort of star lorenzos curiosity which be ever awake make him anxious to solve this mystery he desire that silence might be keep the nun obey him all be hush till the general stillness be again disturb by the groaning which be repeat several time successively he perceive it to be most audible when upon follow the sound he be conduct close to the shrine of st clare the noise come from hence say he whose be this statue helena to whom he address the question pause for a moment suddenly she clap her hand together aye cry she it must be so i have discover the meaning of these groan the nun crowd round her and beseech her eagerly to explain herself she gravely reply that for time immemorial the statue have be famous for perform miracle from this she infer that the saint be concern at the conflagration of a convent which she protect and express her grief by audible lamentation not have equal faith in the miraculous saint lorenzo do not think this solution of the mystery quite so satisfactory a the nun who subscribe to it without hesitation in one point ti true that he agree with helena he suspect that the groan proceed from the statue the more he listen the more be he confirm in this idea he draw nearer to the image designing to inspect it more closely but perceive hi intention the nun beseech him for god sake to desist since if he touch the statue hi death be inevitable and in what consist the danger say he mother of god in what reply helena ever eager to relate a miraculous adventure if you have only hear the hundredth part of those marvellous story about this statue which the domina use to recount she assure u often and often that if we only dare to lay a finger upon it we might expect the most fatal consequence among other thing she tell u that a robber have enter these vault by night he observe yonder ruby whose value be inestimable do you see it segnor it sparkle upon the third finger of the hand in which she hold a crown of thorn this jewel naturally excite the villain cupidity he resolve to make himself master of it for this purpose he ascend the pedestal he support himself by grasp the saint right arm and extend hi own towards the ring what be hi surprize when he saw the statue hand raise in a posture of menace and hear her lip pronounce hi eternal perdition penetrate with awe and consternation he desist from hi attempt and prepare to quit the sepulchre in this he also fail flight be deny him he find it impossible to disengage the hand which rest upon the right arm of the statue in vain do he struggle he remain fix to the image till the insupportable and fiery anguish which dart itself through hi vein compel hi shrieking for assistance the sepulchre be now fill with spectator the villain confess hi sacrilege and be only release by the separation of hi hand from hi body it have remain ever since fasten to the image the robber turn hermit and lead ever after an exemplary life but yet the saint decree be perform and tradition say that he continue to haunt this sepulchre and implore st clares pardon with groan and lamentation now i think of it those which we have just hear may very possibly have be utter by the ghost of this sinner but of this i will not be positive all that i can say be that since that time no one have ever dare to touch the statue then do not be foolhardy good segnor for the love of heaven give up your design nor expose yourself unnecessarily to certain destruction not be convince that hi destruction would be so certain a helena seem to think it lorenzo persist in hi resolution the nun beseech him to desist in piteous term and even point out the robber hand which in effect be still visible upon the arm of the statue this proof a they imagine must convince him it be very far from do so and they be greatly scandalize when he declare hi suspicion that the dried and shrivelled finger have be place there by order of the prioress in spite of their prayer and threat he approach the statue he spring over the iron rail which defend it and the saint underwent a thorough examination the image at first appear to be of stone but prove on further inspection to be form of no more solid material than coloured wood he shake it and attempt to move it but it appear to be of a piece with the base which it stand upon he examine it over and over still no clue guide him to the solution of this mystery for which the nun be become equally solicitous when they saw that he touch the statue with impunity he pause and listen the groan be repeat at interval and he be convince of be in the spot near to them he muse upon this singular event and ran over the statue with enquire eye suddenly they rest upon the shrivelled hand it strike him that so particular an injunction be not give without cause not to touch the arm of the image he again ascend the pedestal he examine the object of hi attention and discover a small knob of iron conceal between the saint shoulder and what be suppose to have be the hand of the
