don quixote de la mancha the author preface idle reader thou mayest believe me without any oath that i would this book a it be the child of my brain be the fair gayest and cleverest that could be imagine but i could not counteract nature law that everything shall beget it like and what then could this sterile illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry shrivelled whimsical offspring full of thought of all sort and such a never come into any other imaginationjust what might be beget in a prison where every misery be lodge and every doleful sound make it dwelling tranquillity a cheerful retreat pleasant field bright sky murmur brooks peace of mind these be the thing that go far to make even the most barren mus fertile and bring into the world birth that fill it with wonder and delight sometimes when a father have an ugly loutish son the love he bear him so blindfold hi eye that he do not see hi defect or rather take them for gift and charm of mind and body and talk of them to hi friend a wit and grace i howeverfor though i pass for the father i be but the stepfather to don quixotehave no desire to go with the current of custom or to implore thee dear reader almost with tear in my eye a other do to pardon or excuse the defect thou wilt perceive in this child of mine thou art neither it kinsman nor it friend thy soul be thine own and thy will as free a any man whateer he be thou art in thine own house and master of it as much a the king of hi tax and thou knowest the common say under my cloak i kill the king all which exempts and free thee from every consideration and obligation and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without fear of be abuse for any ill or reward for any good thou mayest say of it my wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnet epigrams and eulogy such a be commonly put at the beginning of book for i can tell thee though compose it cost me some labour i find none great than the making of this preface thou art now read many time do i take up my pen to write it and many do i lay it down again not know what to write one of these time a i be ponder with the paper before me a pen in my ear my elbow on the desk and my cheek in my hand thinking of what i should say there come in unexpectedly a certain lively clever friend of mine who see me so deep in thought ask the reason to which i make no mystery of it answer that i be think of the preface i have to make for the story of don quixote which so trouble me that i have a mind not to make any at all nor even publish the achievement of so noble a knight for how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient lawgiver they call the public will say when it see me after slumber so many year in the silence of oblivion come out now with all my year upon my back and with a book as dry a a rush devoid of invention meagre in style poor in thought wholly want in learn and wisdom without quotation in the margin or annotation at the end after the fashion of other book i see which though all fable and profanity be so full of maxim from aristotle and plato and the whole herd of philosopher that they fill the reader with amazement and convince them that the author be men of learn erudition and eloquence and then when they quote the holy scripturesanyone would say they be st thomas or other doctor of the church observe a they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it be a pleasure and a treat to hear and read of all this there will be nothing in my book for i have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end and still less do i know what author i follow in it to place them at the beginning a all do under the letter a b c begin with aristotle and end with xenophon or zoilus or zeuxis though one be a slanderer and the other a painter also my book must do without sonnet at the beginning at least sonnet whose author be dukes marquis count bishops lady or famous poet though if i be to ask two or three oblige friend i know they would give me them and such a the production of those that have the high reputation in our spain could not equal in short my friend i continue i be determine that senor don quixote shall remain buried in the archive of hi own la mancha until heaven provide some one to garnish him with all those thing he stand in need of because i find myself through my shallowness and want of learn unequal to supply them and because i be by nature shy and careless about hunt for author to say what i myself can say without them hence the cogitation and abstraction you find me in and reason enough what you have hear from me hear this my friend give himselfa slap on the forehead and break into a hearty laugh exclaim before god brother now be i disabuse of an error in which i have be live all this long time i have know you all through which i have take you to be shrewd and sensible in all you do but now i see you be a far from that a the heaven be from the earth it be possible that thing of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours fit to break through and crush far great obstacle by my faith this come not of any want of ability but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life do you want to know if i be tell the truth well then attend to me and you will see how in the opening and shutting of an eye i sweep away all your difficulty and supply all those deficiency which you say check and discourage you from bring before the world the story of your famous don quixote the light and mirror of all knighterrantry say on say i listen to hi talk how do you propose to make up for my diffidence and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity i be in to which he make answer your first difficulty about the sonnet epigrams or complimentary verse which you want for the beginning and which ought to be by person of importance and rank can be remove if you yourself take a little trouble to make them you can afterwards baptise them and put any name you like to them father them on prester john of the indie or the emperor of trebizond who to my knowledge be say to have be famous poet and even if they be not and any pedant or bachelor should attack you and question the fact never care two maravedis for that for even if they prove a lie against you they can not cut off the hand you write it with a to reference in the margin to the book and author from whom you take the aphorism and saying you put into your story it be only contrive to fit in nicely any sentence or scrap of latin you may happen to have by heart or at any rate that will not give you much trouble to look up so a when you speak of freedom and captivity to insert non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro and then refer in the margin to horace or whoever say it or if you allude to the power of death to come in with pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas regumque turres if it be friendship and the love god bid u bear to our enemy go at once to the holy scripture which you can do with a very small amount of research and quote no less than the word of god himselfego autem dico vobis diligite inimicos vestros if you speak of evil thought turn to the gospel de cord exeunt cogitation malae if of the fickleness of friend there be cato who will give you hi distich donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos tempora si fuerint nubila solus eris with these and such like bit of latin they will take you for a grammarian at all event and that nowadays be no small honour and profit with regard to add annotation at the end of the book you may safely do it in this way if you mention any giant in your book contrive that it shall be the giant goliath and with this alone which will cost you almost nothing you have a grand note for you can putthe giant golias or goliath be a philistine whom the shepherd david slew by a mighty stonecast in the terebinth valley a be relate in the book of kingsin the chapter where you find it write next to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and cosmography manage that the river tagus shall be name in your story and there you be at once with another famous annotation set forththe river tagus be so call after a king of spain it have it source in such and such a place and fall into the ocean kiss the wall of the famous city of lisbon and it be a common belief that it have golden sand etc if you should have anything to do with robber i will give you the story of cacus for i have it by heart if with loose woman there be the bishop of mondonedo who will give you the loan of lamia laida and flora any reference to whom will bring you great credit if with hardhearted one ovid will furnish you with medea if with witch or enchantress homer have calypso and virgil circe if with valiant captain julius caesar himselfwill lend you himselfin hi own commentary and plutarch will give you a thousand alexander if you should deal with love with two ounce you may know of tuscan you can go to leon the hebrew who will supply you to your heart content or if you should not care to go to foreign country you have at home fonsecas of the love of god in which be condense all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on the subject in short all you have to do be to manage to quote these name or refer to these story i have mention and leave it to me to insert the annotation and quotation and i swear by all thats good to fill your margin and use up four sheet at the end of the book now let u come to those reference to author which other book have and you want for yours the remedy for this be very simple you have only to look out for some book that quote them all from a to z a you say yourself and then insert the very same alphabet in your book and though the imposition may be plain to see because you have so little need to borrow from them that be no matter there will probably be some simple enough to believe that you have make use of them all in this plain artless story of yours at any rate if it answer no other purpose this long catalogue of author will serve to give a surprising look of authority to your book besides no one will trouble himselfto verify whether you have follow them or whether you have not be no way concern in it especially a if i mistake not this book of yours have no need of any one of those thing you say it want for it be from begin to end an attack upon the book of chivalry of which aristotle never dream nor st basil say a word nor cicero have any knowledge nor do the nicety of truth nor the observation of astrology come within the range of it fanciful vagary nor have geometrical measurement or refutation of the argument use in rhetoric anything to do with it nor do it mean to preach to anybody mix up thing human and divine a sort of motley in which no christian understanding should dress itself it have only to avail itself of truth to nature in it composition and the more perfect the imitation the good the work will be and a this piece of yours aim at nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which book of chivalry have in the world and with the public there be no need for you to go abegging for aphorism from philosopher precept from holy scripture fables from poet speech from orator or miracle from saint but merely to take care that your style and diction run musically pleasantly and plainly with clear proper and wellplaced word set forth your purpose to the best of your power and put your idea intelligibly without confusion or obscurity strive too that in read your story the melancholy may be move to laughter and the merry make merry still that the simple shall not be weary that the judicious shall admire the invention that the grave shall not despise it nor the wise fail to praise it finally keep your aim fix on the destruction of that illfounded edifice of the book of chivalry hat by some and praise by many more for if you succeed in this you will have achieve no small success in profound silence i listen to what my friend say and hi observation make such an impression on me that without attempt to question them i admit their soundness and out of them i determine to make this preface wherein gentle reader thou wilt perceive my friend good sense my good fortune in find such an adviser in such a time of need and what thou hast gain in receive without addition or alteration the story of the famous don quixote of la mancha who be hold by all the inhabitant of the district of the campo de montiel to have be the chastest lover and the brave knight that have for many year be see in that neighbourhood i have no desire to magnify the service i render thee in make thee acquaint with so renowned and honour a knight but i do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make with the famous sancho panza hi squire in whom to my thinking i have give thee condense all the squirely drollery that be scatter through the swarm of the vain book of chivalry and somay god give thee health and not forget me vale dedication of volume i to the duke of bejar marquis of gibraleon count of benalcazar and banares vicecount of the puebla de alcocer master of the town of capilla curiel and burguillos in belief of the good reception and honour that your excellency bestow on all sort of book a prince so inclined to favor good art chiefly those who by their nobleness do not submit to the service and bribery of the vulgar i have determine bring to light the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha in shelter of your excellency glamorous name to whom with the obeisance i owe to such grandeur i pray to receive it agreeably under hi protection so that in this shadow though deprive of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the work compose in the house of those who know it dare appear with assurance in the judgment of some who trespass the bound of their own ignorance use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writing of other it be my earnest hope that your excellency good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service miguel de cervantes which treat of the character and pursuit of the famous gentleman don quixote of la mancha in a village of la mancha the name of which i have no desire to call to mind there live not long since one of those gentleman that keep a lance in the lancerack an old buckler a lean hack and a greyhound for course an olla of rather more beef than mutton a salad on most night scrap on saturday lentil on friday and a pigeon or so extra on sunday make away with threequarters of hi income the rest of it go in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breech and shoe to match for holiday while on weekday he make a brave figure in hi best homespun he have in hi house a housekeeper past forty a niece under twenty and a lad for the field and marketplace who use to saddle the hack as well a handle the billhook the age of this gentleman of ours be border on fifty he be of a hardy habit spare gauntfeatured a very early riser and a great sportsman they will have it hi surname be quixada or quesada for here there be some difference of opinion among the author who write on the subject although from reasonable conjecture it seem plain that he be call quexana this however be of but little importance to our tale it will be enough not to stray a hair breadth from the truth in the telling of it you must know then that the abovenamed gentleman whenever he be at leisure which be mostly all the year round give himselfup to read book of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglect the pursuit of hi fieldsports and even the management of hi property and to such a pitch do hi eagerness and infatuation go that he sell many an acre of tillageland to buy book of chivalry to read and bring home a many of them a he could get but of all there be none he like so well a those of the famous feliciano de silva composition for their lucidity of style and complicate conceit be a pearl in hi sight particularly when in hi reading he come upon courtship and cartel where he often find passage like the reason of the unreason with which my reason be afflict so weakens my reason that with reason i murmur at your beauty or again the high heaven that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the star render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserve over conceit of this sort the poor gentleman lose hi wit and use to lie awake strive to understand them and worm the mean out of them what aristotle himselfcould not have make out or extract have he come to life again for that special purpose he be not at all easy about the wound which don belianis give and take because it seem to him that great a be the surgeon who have cure him he must have have hi face and body cover all over with seam and scar he commend however the author way of end hi book with the promise of that interminable adventure and many a time be he tempt to take up hi pen and finish it properly a be there propose which no doubt he would have do and make a successful piece of work of it too have not great and more absorbing thought prevent him many an argument do he have with the curate of hi village a learned man and a graduate of siguenza a to which have be the good knight palmerin of england or amadis of gaul master nicholas the village barber however use to say that neither of them come up to the knight of phoebus and that if there be any that could compare with him it be don galaor the brother of amadis of gaul because he have a spirit that be equal to every occasion and be no finikin knight nor lachrymose like hi brother while in the matter of valour he be not a whit behind him in short he become so absorb in hi book that he spend hi night from sunset to sunrise and hi day from dawn to dark poring over them and what with little sleep and much read hi brain get so dry that he lose hi wit hi fancy grow full of what he use to read about in hi book enchantment quarrel battle challenge wound wooing love agony and all sort of impossible nonsense and it so possess hi mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of be true that to him no history in the world have more reality in it he use to say the cid ruy diaz be a very good knight but that he be not to be compare with the knight of the burning sword who with one backstroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giant he think more of bernardo del carpio because at roncesvalles he slew roland in spite of enchantment avail himselfof the artifice of hercules when he strangle antaeus the son of terra in hi arm he approve highly of the giant morgante because although of the giant breed which be always arrogant and illconditioned he alone be affable and wellbred but above all he admire reinaldos of montalban especially when he saw him sallying forth from hi castle and rob everyone he meet and when beyond the sea he steal that image of mahomet which a hi history say be entirely of gold to have a bout of kick at that traitor of a ganelon he would have give hi housekeeper and hi niece into the bargain in short hi wit be quite go he hit upon the strange notion that ever madman in this world hit upon and that be that he fancy it be right and requisite as well for the support of hi own honour a for the service of hi country that he should make a knighterrant of himselfroam the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventure and put in practice himselfall that he have read of a be the usual practice of knightserrant right every kind of wrong and expose himselfto peril and danger from which in the issue he be to reap eternal renown and fame already the poor man saw himselfcrown by the might of hi arm emperor of trebizond at least and so lead away by the intense enjoyment he find in these pleasant fancy he set himselfforthwith to put hi scheme into execution the first thing he do be to clean up some armour that have belong to hi greatgrandfather and have be for age lie forget in a corner eaten with rust and cover with mildew he scour and polish it a best he could but he perceive one great defect in it that it have no closed helmet nothing but a simple morion this deficiency however hi ingenuity supply for he contrive a kind of halfhelmet of pasteboard which fit on to the morion look like a whole one it be true that in order to see if it be strong and fit to stand a cut he draw hi sword and give it a couple of slash the first of which undid in an instant what have take him a week to do the ease with which he have knock it to piece disconcert him somewhat and to guard against that danger he set to work again fix bar of iron on the inside until he be satisfy with it strength and then not care to try any more experiment with it he pass it and adopt it a a helmet of the most perfect construction he next proceed to inspect hi hack which with more quarto than a real and more blemish than the steed of gonela that tantum pellis et os fuit surpass in hi eye the bucephalus of alexander or the babieca of the cid four day be spend in think what name to give him because a he say to himselfit be not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous and one with such merit of hi own should be without some distinctive name and he strive to adapt it so a to indicate what he have be before belong to a knighterrant and what he then be for it be only reasonable that hi master take a new character he should take a new name and that it should be a distinguish and fullsounding one befit the new order and call he be about to follow and so after have compose strike out reject add to unmake and remake a multitude of name out of hi memory and fancy he decide upon call him rocinante a name to hi think lofty sonorous and significant of hi condition a a hack before he become what he now be the first and foremost of all the hack in the world having get a name for hi horse so much to hi taste he be anxious to get one for himselfand he be eight day more pondering over this point till at last he make up hi mind to call himselfdon quixote whence a have be already say the author of this veracious history have infer that hi name must have be beyond a doubt quixada and not quesada a other would have it recollect however that the valiant amadis be not content to call himselfcurtly amadis and nothing more but add the name of hi kingdom and country to make it famous and call himselfamadis of gaul he like a good knight resolve to add on the name of hi and to style himselfdon quixote of la mancha whereby he consider he describe accurately hi origin and country and do honour to it in take hi surname from it so then hi armour be furbish hi morion turn into a helmet hi hack christen and he himselfconfirm he come to the conclusion that nothing more be need now but to look out for a lady to be in love with for a knighterrant without love be like a tree without leaf or fruit or a body without a soul a he say to himselfif for my sin or by my good fortune i come across some giant hereabouts a common occurrence with knightserrant and overthrow him in one onslaught or cleave him asunder to the waist or in short vanquish and subdue him will it not be well to have some one i may send him to a a present that he may come in and fall on hi knee before my sweet lady and in a humble submissive voice say i be the giant caraculiambro lord of the island of malindrania vanquish in single combat by the never sufficiently extol knight don quixote of la mancha who have command me to present myself before your grace that your highness dispose of me at your pleasure oh how our good gentleman enjoy the delivery of this speech especially when he have think of some one to call hi lady there be so the story go in a village near hi own a very goodlooking farmgirl with whom he have be at one time in love though so far a be know she never know it nor give a thought to the matter her name be aldonza lorenzo and upon her he think fit to confer the title of lady of hi thought and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady he decide upon call her dulcinea del tobososhe be of el tobosoa name to hi mind musical uncommon and significant like all those he have already bestow upon himselfand the thing belong to him which treat of the first sally the ingenious don quixote made from home these preliminary settle he do not care to put off any long the execution of hi design urge on to it by the thought of all the world be lose by hi delay see what wrong he intend to right grievance to redress injustice to repair abuse to remove and duty to discharge so without give notice of hi intention to anyone and without anybody see him one morning before the dawning of the day which be one of the hot of the month of july he don hi suit of armour mount rocinante with hi patchedup helmet on brace hi buckler take hi lance and by the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the high contentment and satisfaction at see with what ease he have make a beginning with hi grand purpose but scarcely do he find himselfupon the open plain when a terrible thought strike him one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset it occur to him that he have not be dub a knight and that accord to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arm against any knight and that even if he have be still he ought a a novice knight to wear white armour without a device upon the shield until by hi prowess he have earn one these reflection make him waver in hi purpose but hi craze be strong than any reasoning he make up hi mind to have himselfdub a knight by the first one he come across follow the example of other in the same case a he have read in the book that bring him to this pas a for white armour he resolve on the first opportunity to scour hi until it be whiter than an ermine and so comfort himselfhe pursue hi way take that which hi horse chose for in this he believe lay the essence of adventure thus set out our newfledged adventurer pace along talk to himselfand say who know but that in time to come when the veracious history of my famous deed be make know the sage who write it when he have to set forth my first sally in the early morning will do it after this fashion scarce have the rubicund apollo spread oer the face of the broad spacious earth the golden thread of hi bright hair scarce have the little bird of painted plumage attune their note to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the come of the rosy dawn that desert the soft couch of her jealous spouse be appear to mortal at the gate and balcony of the manchegan horizon when the renowned knight don quixote of la mancha quit the lazy down mount hi celebrated steed rocinante and begin to traverse the ancient and famous campo de montiel which in fact he be actually traverse happy the age happy the time he continue in which shall be make known my deed of fame worthy to be mould in brass carve in marble limn in picture for a memorial for ever and thou o sage magician whoever thou art to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history forget not i entreat thee my good rocinante the constant companion of my way and wandering presently he break out again a if he be lovestricken in earnest o princess dulcinea lady of this captive heart a grievous wrong hast thou do me to drive me forth with scorn and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty o lady deign to hold in remembrance this heart thy vassal that thus in anguish pine for love of thee so he go on string together these and other absurdity all in the style of those hi book have teach him imitate their language as well a he could and all the while he ride so slowly and the sun mount so rapidly and with such fervour that it be enough to melt hi brain if he have any nearly all day he travel without anything remarkable happen to him at which he be in despair for he be anxious to encounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of hi strong arm writer there be who say the first adventure he meet with be that of puerto lapice other say it be that of the windmill but what i have ascertain on this point and what i have find write in the annals of la mancha be that he be on the road all day and towards nightfall hi hack and he find themselves dead tired and hungry when look all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd shanty where he might refresh himselfand relieve hi sore want he perceive not far out of hi road an inn which be as welcome a a star guide him to the portal if not the palace of hi redemption and quicken hi pace he reach it just a night be set in at the door be stand two young woman girl of the district a they call them on their way to seville with some carrier who have chance to halt that night at the inn and a happen what might to our adventurer everything he saw or image seem to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of the moment he saw the inn he picture it to himselfa a castle with it four turret and pinnacle of shin silver not forget the drawbridge and moat and all the belonging usually ascribe to castle of the sort to this inn which to him seem a castle he advance and at a short distance from it he check rocinante hop that some dwarf would show himselfupon the battlement and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight be approach the castle but see that they be slow about it and that rocinante be in a hurry to reach the stable he make for the inn door and perceive the two gay damsel who be stand there and who seem to him to be two fair maiden or lovely lady take their ease at the castle gate at this moment it so happen that a swineherd who be go through the stubble collect a drove of pig for without any apology that be what they be call give a blast of hi horn to bring them together and forthwith it seem to don quixote to be what he be expect the signal of some dwarf announce hi arrival and so with prodigious satisfaction he ride up to the inn and to the lady who see a man of this sort approach in full armour and with lance and buckler be turn in dismay into the inn when don quixote guess their fear by their flight raise hi pasteboard visor disclose hi dry dusty visage and with courteous bearing and gentle voice address them your ladyship need not fly or fear any rudeness for that it belong not to the order of knighthood which i profess to offer to anyone much less to highborn maiden a your appearance proclaims you to be the girl be look at him and strain their eye to make out the feature which the clumsy visor obscure but when they hear themselves call maiden a thing so much out of their line they could not restrain their laughter which make don quixote wax indignant and say modesty become the fair and moreover laughter that have little cause be great silliness this however i say not to pain or anger you for my desire be none other than to serve you the incomprehensible language and the unpromising look of our cavalier only increase the lady laughter and that increase hi irritation and matter might have go far if at that moment the landlord have not come out who be a very fat man be a very peaceful one he see this grotesque figure clad in armour that do not match any more than hi saddle bridle lance buckler or corselet be not at all indispose to join the damsel in their manifestation of amusement but in truth standing in awe of such a complicated armament he think it best to speak him fairly so he say senor caballero if your worship want lodge bat the bed for there be not one in the inn there be plenty of everything els here don quixote observe the respectful bearing of the alcaide of the fortress for so innkeeper and inn seem in hi eye make answer sir castellan for me anything will suffice for my armour be my only wear my only rest the fray the host fancy he call him castellan because he take him for a worthy of castile though he be in fact an andalusian and one from the strand of san lucar a crafty a thief a cacus and a full of trick a a student or a page in that case say he your bed be on the flinty rock your sleep to watch alway and if so you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth not to say for a single night so say he advance to hold the stirrup for don quixote who get down with great difficulty and exertion for he have not break hi fast all day and then charge the host to take great care of hi horse a he be the best bit of flesh that ever eat bread in this world the landlord eye him over but do not find him as good a don quixote say nor even half a good and put him up in the stable he return to see what might be want by hi guest whom the damsel who have by this time make their peace with him be now relieve of hi armour they have take off hi breastplate and backpiece but they neither know nor saw how to open hi gorget or remove hi makeshift helmet for he have fasten it with green ribbon which a there be no untie the knot require to be cut this however he would not by any mean consent to so he remain all the evening with hi helmet on the drollest and odd figure that can be imagine and while they be remove hi armour take the baggage who be about it for lady of high degree belong to the castle he say to them with great sprightliness oh never surely be there knight so serve by hand of dame a served be he don quixote hight when from hi town he come with maiden wait on himselfprincesses on hi hack or rocinante for that lady mine be my horse name and don quixote of la mancha be my own for though i have no intention of declare myself until my achievement in your service and honour have make me know the necessity of adapt that old ballad of lancelot to the present occasion have give you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely a time however will come for your ladyship to command and me to obey and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you the girl who be not use to hear rhetoric of this sort have nothing to say in reply they only ask him if he want anything to eat i would gladly eat a bit of something say don quixote for i feel it would come very seasonably the day happen to be a friday and in the whole inn there be nothing but some piece of the fish they call in castile abadejo in andalusia bacallao and in some place curadillo and in other troutlet so they ask him if he think he could eat troutlet for there be no other fish to give him if there be troutlets enough say don quixote they will be the same thing a a trout for it be all one to me whether i be give eight real in small change or a piece of eight moreover it may be that these troutlets be like veal which be good than beef or kid which be good than goat but whatever it be let it come quickly for the burden and pressure of arm can not be bear without support to the inside they lay a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air and the host bring him a portion of illsoaked and bad cook stockfish and a piece of bread a black and mouldy a hi own armour but a laughable sight it be to see him eat for have hi helmet on and the beaver up he could not with hi own hand put anything into hi mouth unless some one els place it there and this service one of the lady render him but to give him anything to drink be impossible or would have be so have not the landlord bore a reed and put one end in hi mouth pour the wine into him through the other all which he bore with patience rather than sever the ribbon of hi helmet while this be go on there come up to the inn a sowgelder who a he approach sound hi reed pipe four or five time and thereby completely convinced don quixote that he be in some famous castle and that they be regale him with music and that the stockfish be trout the bread the white the wench lady and the landlord the castellan of the castle and consequently he hold that hi enterprise and sally have be to some purpose but still it distress him to think he have not be dub a knight for it be plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receive the order of knighthood chapter iii wherein is related the droll way in which don quixote had himselfdubbed a knight harass by this reflection he make haste with hi scanty pothouse supper and have finish it call the landlord and shut himselfinto the stable with him fell on hi knee before him say from this spot i rise not valiant knight until your courtesy grant me the boon i seek one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the human race the landlord see hi guest at hi foot and hear a speech of this kind stand star at him in bewilderment not know what to do or say and entreat him to rise but all to no purpose until he have agree to grant the boon demand of him i look for no less my lord from your high magnificence reply don quixote and i have to tell you that the boon i have ask and your liberality have grant be that you shall dub me knight tomorrow morning and that tonight i shall watch my arm in the chapel of this your castle thus tomorrow a i have say will be accomplish what i so much desire enable me lawfully to roam through all the four quarter of the world seek adventure on behalf of those in distress a be the duty of chivalry and of knightserrant like myself whose ambition be direct to such deed the landlord who a have be mention be something of a wag and have already some suspicion of hi guest want of wit be quite convinced of it on hear talk of this kind from him and to make sport for the night he determine to fall in with hi humour so he tell him he be quite right in pursue the object he have in view and that such a motive be natural and become in cavalier as distinguish a he seem and hi gallant bearing show him to be and that he himselfin hi younger day have follow the same honourable call roam in quest of adventure in various part of the world among other the curinggrounds of malaga the isle of riaran the precinct of seville the little market of segovia the olivera of valencia the rondilla of granada the strand of san lucar the colt of cordova the tavern of toledo and diver other quarter where he have prove the nimbleness of hi foot and the lightness of hi finger do many wrong cheat many widow ruin maid and swindle minor and in short bring himselfunder the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in spain until at last he have retire to this castle of hi where he be live upon hi property and upon that of other and where he receive all knightserrant of whatever rank or condition they might be all for the great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with him in return for hi benevolence he tell him moreover that in this castle of hi there be no chapel in which he could watch hi armour a it have be pull down in order to be rebuild but that in a case of necessity it might he know be watch anywhere and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle and in the morning god willing the requisite ceremony might be perform so a to have him dub a knight and so thoroughly dub that nobody could be more so he ask if he have any money with him to which don quixote reply that he have not a farthing a in the history of knightserrant he have never read of any of them carry any on this point the landlord tell him he be mistake for though not record in the history because in the author opinion there be no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary a money and clean shirt it be not to be suppose therefore that they do not carry them and he might regard it a certain and establish that all knightserrant about whom there be so many full and unimpeachable book carry wellfurnished purse in case of emergency and likewise carry shirt and a little box of ointment to cure the wound they receive for in those plain and desert where they engage in combat and come out wound it be not always that there be some one to cure them unless indeed they have for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetch through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by taste one drop of it they be cure of their hurt and wound in an instant and leave as sound a if they have not receive any damage whatever but in case this should not occur the knight of old take care to see that their squire be provide with money and other requisite such a lint and ointment for heal purpose and when it happen that knight have no squire which be rarely and seldom the case they themselves carry everything in cunning saddlebag that be hardly see on the horse croup a if it be something els of more importance because unless for some such reason carry saddlebag be not very favourably regard among knightserrant he therefore advise him and a hi godson so soon to be he might even command him never from that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirement and he would find the advantage of them when he least expect it don quixote promise to follow hi advice scrupulously and it be arrange forthwith that he should watch hi armour in a large yard at one side of the inn so collect it all together don quixote place it on a trough that stand by the side of a well and brace hi buckler on hi arm he grasp hi lance and begin with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough and a he begin hi march night begin to fall the landlord tell all the people who be in the inn about the craze of hi guest the watching of the armour and the dubbing ceremony he contemplate full of wonder at so strange a form of madness they flock to see it from a distance and observe with what composure he sometimes pace up and down or sometimes lean on hi lance gaze on hi armour without take hi eye off it for ever so long and a the night close in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with hi that lend it everything the novice knight do be plainly see by all meanwhile one of the carrier who be in the inn think fit to water hi team and it be necessary to remove don quixotes armour a it lay on the trough but he see the other approach hail him in a loud voice o thou whoever thou art rash knight that comest to lay hand on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever gird on sword have a care what thou dost touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life a the penalty of thy rashness the carrier give no heed to these word and he would have do good to heed them if he have be heedful of hi health but seize it by the strap fling the armour some distance from him see this don quixote raise hi eye to heaven and fix hi thought apparently upon hi lady dulcinea exclaim aid me lady mine in this the first encounter that present itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy and with these word and other to the same purpose drop hi buckler he lift hi lance with both hand and with it smite such a blow on the carrier head that he stretch him on the ground so stun that have he follow it up with a second there would have be no need of a surgeon to cure him this do he pick up hi armour and return to hi beat with the same serenity a before shortly after this another not know what have happen for the carrier still lay senseless come with the same object of give water to hi mule and be proceed to remove the armour in order to clear the trough when don quixote without utter a word or implore aid from anyone once more drop hi buckler and once more lifted hi lance and without actually break the second carrier head into piece make more than three of it for he lay it open in four at the noise all the people of the inn run to the spot and among them the landlord see this don quixote brace hi buckler on hi arm and with hi hand on hi sword exclaim o lady of beauty strength and support of my faint heart it be time for thee to turn the eye of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure by this he felt himselfso inspire that he would not have flinch if all the carrier in the world have assail him the comrade of the wounded perceive the plight they be in begin from a distance to shower stone on don quixote who screen himselfa best he could with hi buckler not dare to quit the trough and leave hi armour unprotected the landlord shout to them to leave him alone for he have already tell them that he be mad and a a madman he would not be accountable even if he kill them all still louder shouted don quixote call them knave and traitor and the lord of the castle who allow knightserrant to be treat in this fashion a villain and a lowborn knight whom have he receive the order of knighthood he would call to account for hi treachery but of you he cry base and vile rabble i make no account fling strike come on do all ye can against me ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be this he utter with so much spirit and boldness that he fill hi assailant with a terrible fear and as much for this reason a at the persuasion of the landlord they leave off stone him and he allow them to carry off the wounded and with the same calmness and composure a before resume the watch over hi armour but these freak of hi guest be not much to the liking of the landlord so he determine to cut matter short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur so go up to him he apologise for the rudeness which without hi knowledge have be offer to him by these low people who however have be well punish for their audacity a he have already tell him he say there be no chapel in the castle nor be it need for what remain to be do for a he understand the ceremonial of the order the whole point of be dub a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder and that could be administer in the middle of a field and that he have now do all that be needful a to watch the armour for all requirement be satisfy by a watch of two hour only while he have be more than four about it don quixote believe it all and tell him he stand there ready to obey him and to make an end of it with as much despatch a possible for if he be again attack and felt himselfto be dub knight he would not he think leave a soul alive in the castle except such a out of respect he might spare at hi bidding thus warn and menace the castellan forthwith bring out a book in which he use to enter the straw and barley he serve out to the carrier and with a lad carry a candleend and the two damsel already mention he return to where don quixote stand and bid him kneel down then read from hi accountbook a if he be repeat some devout prayer in the middle of hi delivery he raise hi hand and give him a sturdy blow on the neck and then with hi own sword a smart slap on the shoulder all the while mutter between hi teeth a if he be say hi prayer have do this he direct one of the lady to gird on hi sword which she do with great selfpossession and gravity and not a little be require to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony but what they have already see of the novice knight prowess keep their laughter within bound on gird him with the sword the worthy lady say to him may god make your worship a very fortunate knight and grant you success in battle don quixote ask her name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he be behold for the favour he have receive a he mean to confer upon her some portion of the honour he acquire by the might of hi arm she answer with great humility that she be call la tolosa and that she be the daughter of a cobbler of toledo who live in the stall of sanchobienaya and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him a her lord don quixote say in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assume the don and call herself dona tolosa she promise she would and then the other buckle on hi spur and with her follow almost the same conversation a with the lady of the sword he ask her name and she say it be la molinera and that she be the daughter of a respectable miller of antequera and of her likewise don quixote request that she would adopt the don and call herself dona molinera make offer to her further service and favour have thus with hot haste and speed bring to a conclusion these nevertillnowseen ceremony don quixote be on thorn until he saw himselfon horseback sallying forth in quest of adventure and saddle rocinante at once he mount and embrace hi host a he return thanks for hi kindness in knight him he address him in language so extraordinary that it be impossible to convey an idea of it or report it the landlord to get him out of the inn reply with no less rhetoric though with shorter word and without call upon him to pay the reckon let him go with a godspeed chapter iv of what happened to our knight when he leave the inn day be dawn when don quixote quit the inn so happy so gay so exhilarate at find himselfnow dub a knight that hi joy be like to burst hi horsegirths however recall the advice of hi host a to the requisite he ought to carry with him especially that refer to money and shirt he determine to go home and provide himselfwith all and also with a squire for he reckon upon secure a farmlabourer a neighbour of hi a poor man with a family but very well qualify for the office of squire to a knight with this object he turn hi horse head towards hi village and rocinante thus remind of hi old quarter step out so briskly that he hardly seem to tread the earth he have not go far when out of a thicket on hi right there seem to come feeble cry a of some one in distress and the instant he hear them he exclaim thanks be to heaven for the favour it accord me that it so soon offer me an opportunity of fulfil the obligation i have undertake and gather the fruit of my ambition these cry no doubt come from some man or woman in want of help and need my aid and protection and wheeling he turn rocinante in the direction whence the cry seem to proceed he have go but a few pace into the wood when he saw a mare tie to an oak and tie to another and strip from the waist upwards a youth of about fifteen year of age from whom the cry come nor be they without cause for a lusty farmer be flog him with a belt and follow up every blow with scolding and command repeat your mouth shut and your eye open while the youth make answer i wont do it again master mine by god passion i wont do it again and ill take more care of the flock another time see what be go on don quixote say in an angry voice discourteous knight it ill become you to assail one who can not defend himselfmount your steed and take your lance for there be a lance lean against the oak to which the mare be tie and i will make you know that you be behave a a coward the farmer see before him this figure in full armour brandish a lance over hi head give himselfup for dead and make answer meekly sir knight this youth that i be chastise be my servant employ by me to watch a flock of sheep that i have hard by and he be so careless that i lose one every day and when i punish him for hi carelessness and knavery he say i do it out of niggardliness to escape pay him the wage i owe him and before god and on my soul he lie lie before me base clown say don quixote by the sun that shin on u i have a mind to run you through with this lance pay him at once without another word if not by the god that rule u i will make an end of you and annihilate you on the spot release him instantly the farmer hang hi head and without a word untie hi servant of whom don quixote ask how much hi master owe him he reply nine month at seven real a month don quixote add it up find that it come to sixtythree real and tell the farmer to pay it down immediately if he do not want to die for it the tremble clown reply that a he live and by the oath he have swear though he have not swear any it be not so much for there be to be take into account and deduct three pair of shoe he have give him and a real for two bloodletting when he be sick all that be very well say don quixote but let the shoe and the bloodletting stand a a setoff against the blow you have give him without any cause for if he spoil the leather of the shoe you pay for you have damage that of hi body and if the barber take blood from him when he be sick you have draw it when he be sound so on that score he owe you nothing the difficulty be sir knight that i have no money here let andres come home with me and i will pay him all real by real i go with him say the youth nay god forbid no senor not for the world for once alone with me he would ray me like a saint bartholomew he will do nothing of the kind say don quixote i have only to command and he will obey me and a he have swear to me by the order of knighthood which he have receive i leave him free and i guarantee the payment consider what you be say senor say the youth this master of mine be not a knight nor have he receive any order of knighthood for he be juan haldudo the rich of quintanar that matter little replied don quixote there may be haldudos knight moreover everyone be the son of hi work that be true say andres but this master of mineof what work be he the son when he refuse me the wage of my sweat and labour i do not refuse brother andres say the farmer be good enough to come along with me and i swear by all the order of knighthood there be in the world to pay you a i have agree real by real and perfume for the perfumery i excuse you say don quixote give it to him in real and i shall be satisfied and see that you do a you have swear if not by the same oath i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you and i shall find you though you should lie close than a lizard and if you desire to know who it be lays this command upon you that you be more firmly bind to obey it know that i be the valorous don quixote of la mancha the undoer of wrong and injustice and so god be with you and keep in mind what you have promise and swear under those penalty that have be already declare to you so say he give rocinante the spur and be soon out of reach the farmer follow him with hi eye and when he saw that he have clear the wood and be no longer in sight he turn to hi boy andres and say come here my son i want to pay you what i owe you a that undoer of wrong have command me my oath on it say andres your worship will be well advise to obey the command of that good knightmay he live a thousand yearsfor a he be a valiant and just judge by roque if you do not pay me he will come back and do a he say my oath on it too say the farmer but a i have a strong affection for you i want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment and seize him by the arm he tie him up again and give him such a flogging that he leave him for dead now master andres say the farmer call on the undoer of wrong you will find he wont undo that though i be not sure that i have quite do with you for i have a good mind to flay you alive but at last he untie him and give him leave to go look for hi judge in order to put the sentence pronounce into execution andres go off rather down in the mouth swearing he would go to look for the valiant don quixote of la mancha and tell him exactly what have happen and that all would have to be repay him sevenfold but for all that he go off weep while hi master stand laugh thus do the valiant don quixote right that wrong and thoroughly satisfy with what have take place a he consider he have make a very happy and noble begin with hi knighthood he take the road towards hi village in perfect selfcontent say in a low voice well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth o dulcinea del toboso fair of the fair since it have fall to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned a be and will be don quixote of la mancha who a all the world know yesterday receive the order of knighthood and hath today right the great wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceive and cruelty perpetrate who hath today pluck the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lash that tender child he now come to a road branching in four direction and immediately he be remind of those crossroad where knightserrant use to stop to consider which road they should take in imitation of them he halt for a while and after have deeply consider it he give rocinante hi head submit hi own will to that of hi hack who follow out hi first intention which be to make straight for hi own stable after he have go about two mile don quixote perceive a large party of people who a afterwards appear be some toledo trader on their way to buy silk at murcia there be six of them come along under their sunshade with four servant mount and three muleteer on foot scarcely have don quixote descry them when the fancy possess him that this must be some new adventure and to help him to imitate as far a he could those passage he have read of in hi book here seem to come one make on purpose which he resolve to attempt so with a lofty bearing and determination he fix himselffirmly in hi stirrup get hi lance ready bring hi buckler before hi breast and plant himselfin the middle of the road stand wait the approach of these knightserrant for such he now consider and hold them to be and when they have come near enough to see and hear he exclaim with a haughty gesture all the world stand unless all the world confess that in all the world there be no maiden fairer than the empress of la mancha the peerless dulcinea del toboso the trader halt at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that utter it and from both figure and language at once guess the craze of their owner they wish however to learn quietly what be the object of this confession that be demand of them and one of them who be rather fond of a joke and be very sharpwitted say to him sir knight we do not know who this good lady be that you speak of show her to u for if she be of such beauty a you suggest with all our heart and without any pressure we will confess the truth that be on your part require of u if i be to show her to you replied don quixote what merit would you have in confess a truth so manifest the essential point be that without see her you must believe confess affirm swear and defend it els ye have to do with me in battle illconditioned arrogant rabble that ye be and come ye on one by one a the order of knighthood require or all together a be the custom and vile usage of your breed here do i bide and await you rely on the justice of the cause i maintain sir knight reply the trader i entreat your worship in the name of this present company of prince that to save u from charge our conscience with the confession of a thing we have never see or hear of and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the empress and queen of the alcarria and estremadura your worship will be please to show u some portrait of this lady though it be no big than a grain of wheat for by the thread one get at the ball and in this way we shall be satisfy and easy and you will be content and pleased nay i believe we be already so far agree with you that even though her portrait should show her blind of one eye and distil vermilion and sulphur from the other we would nevertheless to gratify your worship say all in her favour that you desire she distil nothing of the kind vile rabble say don quixote burn with rage nothing of the kind i say only ambergris and civet in cotton nor be she oneeyed or humpbacked but straight than a guadarrama spindle but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have utter against beauty like that of my lady and so say he charge with levelled lance against the one who have speak with such fury and fierceness that if luck have not contrive that rocinante should stumble midway and come down it would have go hard with the rash trader down go rocinante and over go hi master roll along the ground for some distance and when he try to rise he be unable so encumbered be he with lance buckler spur helmet and the weight of hi old armour and all the while he be struggle to get up he keep say fly not coward and caitiff stay for not by my fault but my horse be i stretch here one of the muleteer in attendance who could not have have much good nature in him hear the poor prostrate man bluster in this style be unable to refrain from give him an answer on hi rib and come up to him he seize hi lance and have break it in piece with one of them he begin so to belabour our don quixote that notwithstanding and in spite of hi armour he mill him like a measure of wheat hi master call out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone but the muleteer blood be up and he do not care to drop the game until he have vent the rest of hi wrath and gather up the remain fragment of the lance he finish with a discharge upon the unhappy victim who all through the storm of stick that rain on him never cease threaten heaven and earth and the brigand for such they seem to him at last the muleteer be tire and the trader continue their journey take with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who have be cudgel he when he find himselfalone make another effort to rise but if he be unable when whole and sound how be he to rise after have be thrash and wellnigh knock to piece and yet he esteem himselffortunate a it seem to him that this be a regular knighterrants mishap and entirely he consider the fault of hi horse however batter in body a he be to rise be beyond hi power chapter v in which the narrative of our knight mishap is continued find then that in fact he could not move he think himselfof have recourse to hi usual remedy which be to think of some passage in hi book and hi craze bring to hi mind that about baldwin and the marquis of mantua when carloto leave him wound on the mountain side a story know by heart by the child not forget by the young men and laud and even believe by the old folk and for all that not a whit truer than the miracle of mahomet this seem to him to fit exactly the case in which he find himselfso make a show of severe suffer he begin to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very word which the wounded knight of the wood be say to have utter where art thou lady mine that thou my sorrow dost not rue thou canst not know it lady mine or els thou art untrue and so he go on with the ballad as far a the line o noble marquis of mantua my uncle and liege lord a chance would have it when he have get to this line there happen to come by a peasant from hi own village a neighbour of hi who have be with a load of wheat to the mill and he see the man stretch there come up to him and ask him who he be and what be the matter with him that he complain so dolefully don quixote be firmly persuade that this be the marquis of mantua hi uncle so the only answer he make be to go on with hi ballad in which he tell the tale of hi misfortune and of the love of the emperor son and hi wife all exactly a the ballad sing it the peasant stood amaze at hear such nonsense and relieve him of the visor already batter to piece by blow he wipe hi face which be cover with dust and as soon a he have do so he recognise him and say senor quixada for so he appear to have be call when he be in hi sens and have not yet change from a quiet country gentleman into a knighterrant who have bring your worship to this pas but to all question the other only go on with hi ballad see this the good man remove as well a he could hi breastplate and backpiece to see if he have any wound but he could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever he then contrive to raise him from the ground and with no little difficulty hoist him upon hi as which seem to him to be the easy mount for him and collect the arm even to the splinter of the lance he tie them on rocinante and lead him by the bridle and the as by the halter he take the road for the village very sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixote be talk nor be don quixote less so for what with blow and bruise he could not sit upright on the as and from time to time he send up sigh to heaven so that once more he drive the peasant to ask what ail him and it could have be only the devil himselfthat put into hi head tale to match hi own adventure for now forget baldwin he bethink himselfof the moor abindarraez when the alcaide of antequera rodrigo de narvaez take him prisoner and carry him away to hi castle so that when the peasant again ask him how he be and what ail him he give him for reply the same word and phrase that the captive abindarraez give to rodrigo de narvaez just a he have read the story in the diana of jorge de montemayor where it be write apply it to hi own case so aptly that the peasant go along curse hi fate that he have to listen to such a lot of nonsense from which however he come to the conclusion that hi neighbour be mad and so make all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixotes who at the end of it say senor don rodrigo de narvaez your worship must know that this fair xarifa i have mention be now the lovely dulcinea del toboso for whom i have do be do and will do the most famous deed of chivalry that in this world have be see be to be see or ever shall be see to this the peasant answer senorsinner that i amcannot your worship see that i be not don rodrigo de narvaez nor the marquis of mantua but pedro alonso your neighbour and that your worship be neither baldwin nor abindarraez but the worthy gentleman senor quixada i know who i be replied don quixote and i know that i may be not only those i have name but all the twelve peer of france and even all the nine worthy since my achievement surpass all that they have do all together and each of them on hi own account with this talk and more of the same kind they reach the village just a night be begin to fall but the peasant wait until it be a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be see rid in such a miserable trim when it be what seem to him the proper time he enter the village and go to don quixotes house which he find all in confusion and there be the curate and the village barber who be great friend of don quixote and hi housekeeper be say to them in a loud voice what do your worship think can have befall my master senor licentiate pero perez for so the curate be call it be three day now since anything have be see of him or the hack or the buckler lance or armour miserable me i be certain of it and it be as true a that i be bear to die that these accursed book of chivalry he have and have get into the way of read so constantly have upset hi reason for now i remember have often hear him say to himselfthat he would turn knighterrant and go all over the world in quest of adventure to the devil and barabbas with such book that have bring to ruin in this way the fine understanding there be in all la mancha the niece say the same and more you must know master nicholasfor that be the name of the barberit be often my uncles way to stay two day and night together pore over these unholy book of misventures after which he would fling the book away and snatch up hi sword and fall to slash the wall and when he be tire out he would say he have kill four giant like four tower and the sweat that flow from him when he be weary he say be the blood of the wound he have receive in battle and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet say that this water be a most precious potion which the sage esquife a great magician and friend of hi have bring him but i take all the blame upon myself for never have tell your worship of my uncles vagary that you might put a stop to them before thing have come to this pas and burn all these accurse booksfor he have a great numberthat richly deserve to be burn like heretic so say i too say the curate and by my faith tomorrow shall not pass without public judgment upon them and may they be condemn to the flame l they lead those that read to behave a my good friend seem to have behave all this the peasant heard and from it he understand at last what be the matter with hi neighbour so he begin call aloud open your worship to senor baldwin and to senor the marquis of mantua who come badly wounded and to senor abindarraez the moor whom the valiant rodrigo de narvaez the alcaide of antequera bring captive at these word they all hurry out and when they recognise their friend master and uncle who have not yet dismount from the as because he could not they run to embrace him hold say he for i be badly wound through my horse fault carry me to bed and if possible send for the wise urganda to cure and see to my wound see there plague on it cry the housekeeper at this do not my heart tell the truth a to which foot my master go lame of to bed with your worship at once and we will contrive to cure you here without fetch that hurgada a curse i say once more and a hundred time more on those book of chivalry that have bring your worship to such a pas they carry him to bed at once and after search for hi wound could find none but he say they be all bruise from have have a severe fall with hi horse rocinante when in combat with ten giant the big and the bold to be find on earth so so say the curate be there giant in the dance by the sign of the cross i will burn them tomorrow before the day over they put a host of question to don quixote but hi only answer to all wasgive him something to eat and leave him to sleep for that be what he need most they do so and the curate question the peasant at great length a to how he have find don quixote he tell him and the nonsense he have talk when find and on the way home all which make the licentiate the more eager to do what he do the next day which be to summon hi friend the barber master nicholas and go with him to don quixotes house chapter vi of the diverting and important scrutiny which the curate and the barber made in the library of our ingenious gentleman he be still sleep so the curate ask the niece for the key of the room where the book the author of all the mischief be and right willingly she give them they all go in the housekeeper with them and find more than a hundred volume of big book very well bound and some other small one the moment the housekeeper saw them she turn about and run out of the room and come back immediately with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler say here your worship senor licentiate sprinkle this room dont leave any magician of the many there be in these book to bewitch u in revenge for our design of banish them from the world the simplicity of the housekeeper make the licentiate laugh and he direct the barber to give him the book one by one to see what they be about a there might be some to be find among them that do not deserve the penalty of fire no say the niece there be no reason for show mercy to any of them they have every one of them do mischief well fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them or els carry them into the yard and there a bonfire can be make without the smoke give any annoyance the housekeeper say the same so eager be they both for the slaughter of those innocent but the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the title the first that master nicholas put into hi hand be the four book of amadis of gaul this seem a mysterious thing say the curate for a i have hear say this be the first book of chivalry print in spain and from this all the other derive their birth and origin so it seem to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flame a the founder of so vile a sect nay sir say the barber i too have hear say that this be the best of all the book of this kind that have be write and so a something singular in it line it ought to be pardon true say the curate and for that reason let it life be spar for the present let u see that other which be next to it it be say the barber the sergas de esplandian the lawful son of amadis of gaul then verily say the curate the merit of the father must not be put down to the account of the son take it mistress housekeeper open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for the bonfire we be to make the housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction and the worthy esplandian go fly into the yard to await with all patience the fire that be in store for him proceed say the curate this that come next say the barber be amadis of greece and indeed i believe all those on this side be of the same amadis lineage then to the yard with the whole of them say the curate for to have the burning of queen pintiquiniestra and the shepherd darinel and hi eclogue and the bedevilled and involved discourse of hi author i would burn with them the father who beget me if he be go about in the guise of a knighterrant i be of the same mind say the barber and so be i add the niece in that case say the housekeeper here into the yard with them they be hand to her and a there be many of them she spar herself the staircase and fling them down out of the window who be that tub there say the curate this say the barber be don olivante de laura the author of that book say the curate be the same that write the garden of flower and truly there be no decide which of the two book be the more truthful or to put it good the less lie all i can say be send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool this that follow be florismarte of hircania say the barber senor florismarte here say the curate then by my faith he must take up hi quarter in the yard in spite of hi marvellous birth and visionary adventure for the stiffness and dryness of hi style deserve nothing els into the yard with him and the other mistress housekeeper with all my heart senor say she and execute the order with great delight this say the barber be the knight platir an old book that say the curate but i find no reason for clemency in it send it after the other without appeal which be do another book be open and they saw it be entitle the knight of the cross for the sake of the holy name this book have say the curate it ignorance might be excuse but then they say behind the cross theres the devil to the fire with it take down another book the barber say this be the mirror of chivalry i know hi worship say the curate that be where senor reinaldos of montalvan figure with hi friend and comrade great thief than cacus and the twelve peer of france with the veracious historian turpin however i be not for condemn them to more than perpetual banishment because at any rate they have some share in the invention of the famous matteo boiardo whence too the christian poet ludovico ariosto weave hi web to whom if i find him here and speak any language but hi own i shall show no respect whatever but if he speak hi own tongue i will put him upon my head well i have him in italian say the barber but i do not understand him nor would it be well that you should understand him say the curate and on that score we might have excuse the captain if he have not bring him into spain and turn him into castilian he rob him of a great deal of hi natural force and so do all those who try to turn book write in verse into another language for with all the pain they take and all the cleverness they show they never can reach the level of the original a they be first produce in short i say that this book and all that may be find treating of those french affair should be throw into or deposit in some dry well until after more consideration it be settle what be to be do with them except always one bernardo del carpio that be go about and another call roncesvalles for these if they come into my hand shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper and from hers into the fire without any reprieve to all this the barber give hi assent and look upon it a right and proper be persuade that the curate be so staunch to the faith and loyal to the truth that he would not for the world say anything oppose to them open another book he saw it be palmerin de oliva and beside it be another call palmerin of england see which the licentiate say let the olive be make firewood of at once and burn until no ash even be leave and let that palm of england be keep and preserve a a thing that stand alone and let such another case be make for it a that which alexander find among the spoil of darius and set aside for the safe keep of the work of the poet homer this book gossip be of authority for two reason first because it be very good and secondly because it be say to have be write by a wise and witty king of portugal all the adventure at the castle of miraguarda be excellent and of admirable contrivance and the language be polish and clear studying and observe the style befit the speaker with propriety and judgment so then provide it seem good to you master nicholas i say let this and amadis of gaul be remit the penalty of fire and a for all the rest let them perish without further question or query nay gossip say the barber for this that i have here be the famous donbelianis well say the curate that and the second third and fourth part all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile and they must be clear of all that stuff about the castle of fame and other great affectation to which end let them be allow the overseas term and accord a they mend so shall mercy or justice be mete out to them and in the mean time gossip do you keep them in your house and let no one read them with all my heart say the barber and not care to tire himselfwith read more book of chivalry he tell the housekeeper to take all the big one and throw them into the yard it be not say to one dull or deaf but to one who enjoy burn them more than weave the broad and fine web that could be and seize about eight at a time she fling them out of the window in carry so many together she let one fall at the foot of the barber who take it up curious to know whose it be and find it say history of the famous knight tirante el blanco god bless me say the curate with a shout tirante el blanco here hand it over gossip for in it i reckon i have find a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation here be don kyrieleison of montalvan a valiant knight and hi brother thomas of montalvan and the knight fonseca with the battle the bold tirante fought with the mastiff and the witticism of the damsel placerdemivida and the love and wile of the widow reposada and the empress in love with the squire hipolitoin truth gossip by right of it style it be the best book in the world here knight eat and sleep and die in their bed and make their will before die and a great deal more of which there be nothing in all the other book nevertheless i say he who write it for deliberately compose such foolery deserve to be send to the galley for life take it home with you and read it and you will see that what i have say be true a you will say the barber but what be we to do with these little book that be leave these must be not chivalry but poetry say the curate and open one he saw it be the diana of jorge de montemayor and suppose all the other to be of the same sort these he say do not deserve to be burn like the other for they neither do nor can do the mischief the book of chivalry have do be book of entertainment that can hurt no one ah senor say the niece your worship have good order these to be burn as well a the other for it would be no wonder if after be cure of hi chivalry disorder my uncle by read these take a fancy to turn shepherd and range the wood and field sing and pip or what would be still bad to turn poet which they say be an incurable and infectious malady the damsel be right say the curate and it will be well to put this stumblingblock and temptation out of our friend way to begin then with the diana of montemayor i be of opinion it should not be burn but that it should be clear of all that about the sage felicia and the magic water and of almost all the long piece of verse let it keep and welcome it prose and the honour of be the first of book of the kind this that come next say the barber be the diana entitle the second part by the salamancan and this other have the same title and it author be gil polo a for that of the salamancan reply the curate let it go to swell the number of the condemn in the yard and let gil polo be preserve a if it come from apollo himselfbut get on gossip and make haste for it be grow late this book say the barber open another be the ten book of the fortune of love write by antonio de lofraso a sardinian poet by the order i have receive say the curate since apollo have be apollo and the mus have be mus and poet have be poet so droll and absurd a book a this have never be write and in it way it be the best and the most singular of all of this specie that have a yet appear and he who have not read it may be sure he have never read what be delightful give it here gossip for i make more account of have find it than if they have give me a cassock of florence stuff he put it aside with extreme satisfaction and the barber go on these that come next be the shepherd of iberia nymph of henares and the enlightenment of jealousy then all we have to do say the curate be to hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper and ask me not why or we shall never have do this next be the pastor de filida no pastor that say the curate but a highly polish courtier let it be preserve a a precious jewel this large one here say the barber be call the treasury of various poem if there be not so many of them say the curate they would be more relished this book must be weed and cleanse of certain vulgarity which it have with it excellence let it be preserve because the author be a friend of mine and out of respect for other more heroic and lofty work that he have write this continue the barber be the cancionero of lopez de maldonado the author of that book too say the curate be a great friend of mine and hi verse from hi own mouth be the admiration of all who hear them for such be the sweetness of hi voice that he enchant when he chant them it give rather too much of it eclogue but what be good be never yet plentiful let it be keep with those that have be set apart but what book be that next it the galatea of miguel de cervantes say the barber that cervantes have be for many year a great friend of mine and to my knowledge he have have more experience in revers than in verse hi book have some good invention in it it present u with something but bring nothing to a conclusion we must wait for the second part it promise perhaps with amendment it may succeed in win the full measure of grace that be now deny it and in the mean time do you senor gossip keep it shut up in your own quarter very good say the barber and here come three together the araucana of don alonso de ercilla the austriada of juan rufo justice of cordova and the montserrate of christobal de virues the valencianpoet these three book say the curate be the best that have be write in castilian in heroic verse and they may compare with the most famous of italy let them be preserve a the rich treasure of poetry that spain possess the curate be tire and would not look into any more book and so he decide that content uncertified all the rest should be burn but just then the barber hold open one call the tear of angelica i should have shed tear myself say the curate when he hear the title have i order that book to be burn for it author be one of the famous poet of the world not to say of spain and be very happy in the translation of some of ovid fable chapter vii of the second sally of our worthy knight don quixote of la mancha at this instant don quixote begin shout out here here valiant knight here be need for you to put forth the might of your strong arm for they of the court be gain the mastery in the tourney call away by this noise and outcry they proceed no farther with the scrutiny of the remain book and so it be think that the carolea the lion of spain and the deed of the emperor write by don luis de avila go to the fire unseen and unheard for no doubt they be among those that remain and perhaps if the curate have see them they would not have undergone so severe a sentence when they reach don quixote he be already out of bed and be still shout and rave and slash and cut all round a wide awake a if he have never sleep they close with him and by force get him back to bed and when he have become a little calm address the curate he say to him of a truth senor archbishop turpin it be a great disgrace for u who call ourselves the twelve peer so carelessly to allow the knight of the court to gain the victory in this tourney we the adventurer have carry off the honour on the three former day hush gossip say the curate please god the luck may turn and what be lose today may be win tomorrow for the present let your worship have a care of your health for it seem to me that you be overfatigue if not badly wound wounded no say don quixote but bruise and batter no doubt for that bastard don roland have cudgel me with the trunk of an oak tree and all for envy because he see that i alone rival him in hi achievement but i should not call myself reinaldos of montalvan do he not pay me for it in spite of all hi enchantment as soon a i rise from this bed for the present let them bring me something to eat for that i feel be what will be more to my purpose and leave it to me to avenge myself they do a he wish they give him something to eat and once more he fell asleep leave them marvel at hi madness that night the housekeeper burn to ash all the book that be in the yard and in the whole house and some must have be consume that deserved preservation in everlasting archive but their fate and the laziness of the examiner do not permit it and so in them be verify the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty one of the remedy which the curate and the barber immediately apply to their friend disorder be to wall up and plaster the room where the book be so that when he get up he should not find them possibly the cause be remove the effect might cease and they might say that a magician have carry them off room and all and this be do with all despatch two day later don quixote get up and the first thing he do be to go and look at hi book and not find the room where he have leave it he wander from side to side look for it he come to the place where the door use to be and try it with hi hand and turn and twist hi eye in every direction without say a word but after a good while he ask hi housekeeper whereabouts be the room that hold hi book the housekeeper who have be already well instruct in what she be to answer say what room or what nothing be it that your worship be look for there be neither room nor book in this house now for the devil himselfhave carry all away it be not the devil say the niece but a magician who come on a cloud one night after the day your worship leave this and dismount from a serpent that he ride he enter the room and what he do there i know not but after a little while he make off fly through the roof and leave the house full of smoke and when we go to see what he have do we saw neither book nor room but we remember very well the housekeeper and i that on leave the old villain say in a loud voice that for a private grudge he owe the owner of the book and the room he have do mischief in that house that would be discover byandby he say too that hi name be the sage munaton he must have say friston say don quixote i dont know whether he call himselffriston or friton say the housekeeper i only know that hi name end with ton so it do say don quixote and he be a sage magician a great enemy of mine who have a spite against me because he know by hi art and lore that in process of time i be to engage in single combat with a knight whom he befriend and that i be to conquer and he will be unable to prevent it and for this reason he endeavour to do me all the ill turn that he can but i promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what be decree by heaven who doubt that say the niece but uncle who mix you up in these quarrel would it not be good to remain at peace in your own house instead of roam the world look for good bread than ever come of wheat never reflect that many go for wool and come back shorn oh niece of mine reply don quixote how much astray art thou in thy reckon ere they shear me i shall have pluck away and strip off the beard of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine the two be unwilling to make any further answer a they saw that hi anger be kindle in short then he remain at home fifteen day very quietly without show any sign of a desire to take up with hi former delusion and during this time he hold lively discussion with hi two gossip the curate and the barber on the point he maintain that knightserrant be what the world stand most in need of and that in him be to be accomplish the revival of knighterrantry the curate sometimes contradict him sometimes agree with him for if he have not observe this precaution he would have be unable to bring him to reason meanwhile don quixote work upon a farm labourer a neighbour of hi an honest man if indeed that title can be give to him who be poor but with very little wit in hi pate in a word he so talk him over and with such persuasion and promise that the poor clown make up hi mind to sally forth with him and serve him a esquire don quixote among other thing tell him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it on these and the like promise sancho panza for so the labourer be call left wife and child and engage himselfa esquire to hi neighbour don quixote next set about get some money and sell one thing and pawn another and make a bad bargain in every case he get together a fair sum he provide himselfwith a buckler which he beg a a loan from a friend and restore hi battered helmet a best he could he warn hi squire sancho of the day and hour he mean to set out that he might provide himselfwith what he think most needful above all he charge him to take alforjas with him the other say he would and that he mean to take also a very good as he have a he be not much give to go on foot about the as don quixote hesitate a little try whether he could call to mind any knighterrant taking with him an esquire mount on assback but no instance occur to hi memory for all that however he determine to take him intend to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it present itself by appropriate the horse of the first discourteous knight he encounter himselfhe provide with shirt and such other thing a he could accord to the advice the host have give him all which be do without take leave sancho panza of hi wife and child or don quixote of hi housekeeper and niece they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night and make such good way in the course of it that by daylight they hold themselves safe from discovery even should search be make for them sancho rode on hi as like a patriarch with hi alforjas and bota and longing to see himselfsoon governor of the island hi master have promise him don quixote decide upon take the same route and road he have take on hi first journey that over the campo de montiel which he travel with less discomfort than on the last occasion for a it be early morning and the ray of the sun fell on them obliquely the heat do not distress them and now say sancho panza to hi master your worship will take care senor knighterrant not to forget about the island you have promise me for be it ever so big ill be equal to govern it to which don quixote reply thou must know friend sancho panza that it be a practice very much in vogue with the knightserrant of old to make their squire governor of the island or kingdom they win and i be determine that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom on the contrary i mean to improve upon it for they sometimes and perhaps most frequently wait until their squire be old and then when they have have enough of service and hard day and bad night they give them some title or other of count or at the most marquis of some valley or province more or less but if thou liv and i live it may well be that before six day be over i may have win some kingdom that have other dependent upon it which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crown king of one of them nor needst thou count this wonderful for thing and chance fall to the lot of such knight in way so unexampled and unexpected that i might easily give thee even more than i promise thee in that case say sancho panza if i should become a king by one of those miracle your worship speaks of even juana gutierrez my old woman would come to be queen and my child infant well who doubt it say don quixote i doubt it reply sancho panza because for my part i be persuade that though god should shower down kingdom upon earth not one of them would fit the head of mari gutierrez let me tell you senor she be not worth two maravedis for a queen countess will fit her good and that only with god help leave it to god sancho return don quixote for he will give her what suit her best but do not undervalue thyself so much a to come to be content with anything less than be governor of a province i will not senor answered sancho specially a i have a man of such quality for a master in your worship who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that i can bear chapter viii of the good fortune which the valiant don quixote had in the terrible and undreamtof adventure of the windmill with other occurrence worthy to be fitly recorded at this point they come in sight of thirty forty windmill that there be on plain and as soon a don quixote saw them he say to hi squire fortune be arrange matter for u good than we could have shape our desire ourselves for look there friend sancho panza where thirty or more monstrous giant present themselves all of whom i mean to engage in battle and slay and with whose spoil we shall begin to make our fortune for this be righteous warfare and it be god good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth what giants say sancho panza those thou seest there answer hi master with the long arm and some have them nearly two league long look your worship say sancho what we see there be not giant but windmill and what seem to be their arm be the sail that turn by the wind make the millstone go it be easy to see replied don quixote that thou art not use to this business of adventure those be giant and if thou art afraid away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while i engage them in fierce and unequal combat so say he give the spur to hi steed rocinante heedless of the cry hi squire sancho send after him warn him that most certainly they be windmill and not giant he be go to attack he however be so positive they be giant that he neither hear the cry of sancho nor perceive near a he be what they be but make at them shout fly not coward and vile being for a single knight attack you a slight breeze at this moment spring up and the great sail begin to move see which don quixote exclaim though ye flourish more arm than the giant briareus ye have to reckon with me so say and commend himselfwith all hi heart to hi lady dulcinea implore her to support him in such a peril with lance in rest and cover by hi buckler he charge at rocinantes full gallop and fell upon the first mill that stand in front of him but a he drive hi lancepoint into the sail the wind whirl it round with such force that it shiver the lance to piece sweep with it horse and rider who go roll over on the plain in a sorry condition sancho hasten to hi assistance as fast a hi as could go and when he come up find him unable to move with such a shock have rocinante fall with him god bless me say sancho do i not tell your worship to mind what you be about for they be only windmill and no one could have make any mistake about it but one who have something of the same kind in hi head hush friend sancho reply don quixote the fortune of war more than any other be liable to frequent fluctuation and moreover i think and it be the truth that that same sage friston who carry off my study and book have turn these giant into mill in order to rob me of the glory of vanquish them such be the enmity he bear me but in the end hi wicked art will avail but little against my good sword god order it a he may say sancho panza and help him to rise get him up again on rocinante whose shoulder be half out and then discuss the late adventure they follow the road to puerto lapice for there say don quixote they could not fail to find adventure in abundance and variety a it be a great thoroughfare for all that he be much grieve at the loss of hi lance and say so to hi squire he add i remember have read how a spanish knight diego perez de vargas by name have break hi sword in battle tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch and with it do such thing that day and pound so many moor that he get the surname of machuca and he and hi descendant from that day forth be call vargas y machuca i mention this because from the first oak i see i mean to rend such another branch large and stout like that with which i be determine and resolve to do such deed that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in be find worthy to come and see them and be an eyewitness of thing that will with difficulty be believe be that a god will say sancho i believe it all a your worship say it but straighten yourself a little for you seem all on one side may be from the shaking of the fall that be the truth say don quixote and if i make no complaint of the pain it be because knightserrant be not permit to complain of any wound even though their bowel be come out through it if so say sancho i have nothing to say but god know i would rather your worship complain when anything ail you for my part i confess i must complain however small the ache may be unless this rule about not complain extends to the squire of knightserrant also don quixote could not help laugh at hi squire simplicity and he assure him he might complain whenever and however he choose just a he like for so far he have never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood sancho bid him remember it be dinnertime to which hi master answer that he want nothing himselfjust then but that he might eat when he have a mind with this permission sancho settle himselfas comfortably a he could on hi beast and take out of the alforjas what he have stow away in them he jog along behind hi master munch deliberately and from time to time take a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirsty tapster in malaga might have envy and while he go on in this way gulp down draught after draught he never give a thought to any of the promise hi master have make him nor do he rate it a hardship but rather a recreation go in quest of adventure however dangerous they might be finally they pass the night among some tree from one of which don quixote pluck a dry branch to serve him after a fashion a a lance and fix on it the head he have remove from the broken one all that night don quixote lay awake thinking of hi lady dulcinea in order to conform to what he have read in hi book how many a night in the forest and desert knight use to lie sleepless support by the memory of their mistress not so do sancho panza spend it for have hi stomach full of something strong than chicory water he make but one sleep of it and if hi master have not call him neither the ray of the sun beating on hi face nor all the cheery note of the bird welcome the approach of day would have have power to waken him on get up he try the bota and find it somewhat less full than the night before which grieve hi heart because they do not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily don quixote do not care to break hi fast for as have be already say he confine himselfto savoury recollection for nourishment they return to the road they have set out with lead to puerto lapice and at three in the afternoon they come in sight of it here brother sancho panza say don quixote when he saw it we may plunge our hand up to the elbow in what they call adventure but observe even shouldst thou see me in the great danger in the world thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me be rabble or base folk for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me but if they be knight it be on no account permit or allow thee by the law of knighthood to help me until thou hast be dub a knight most certainly senor replied sancho your worship shall be fully obey in this matter all the more a of myself i be peaceful and no friend to mix in strife and quarrel it be true that a regard the defence of my own person i shall not give much heed to those law for law human and divine allow each one to defend himselfagainst any assailant whatever that i grant say don quixote but in this matter of aid me against knight thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity i will do so i promise you answer sancho and will keep this precept as carefully a sunday while they be thus talk there appear on the road two friar of the order of st benedict mount on two dromedary for not less tall be the two mule they ride on they wear travel spectacle and carry sunshade and behind them come a coach attend by four or five person on horseback and two muleteer on foot in the coach there be a afterwards appear a biscay lady on her way to seville where her husband be about to take passage for the indie with an appointment of high honour the friar though go the same road be not in her company but the moment don quixote perceive them he say to hi squire either i be mistaken or this be go to be the most famous adventure that have ever be see for those black body we see there must be and doubtless be magician who be carry off some stolen princess in that coach and with all my might i must undo this wrong this will be bad than the windmill say sancho look senor those be friar of st benedict and the coach plainly belong to some traveller i tell you to mind well what you be about and dont let the devil mislead you i have tell thee already sancho reply don quixote that on the subject of adventure thou knowest little what i say be the truth a thou shalt see presently so say he advance and post himselfin the middle of the road along which the friar be come and as soon a he think they have come near enough to hear what he say he cry aloud devilish and unnatural being release instantly the highborn princesses whom you be carry off by force in this coach els prepare to meet a speedy death a the just punishment of your evil deeds the friar draw rein and stand wonder at the appearance of don quixote as well a at hi word to which they reply senor caballero we be not devilish or unnatural but two brother of st benedict follow our road nor do we know whether or not there be any captive princess come in this coach no soft word with me for i know you lie rabble say don quixote and without wait for a reply he spur rocinante and with levelled lance charge the first friar with such fury and determination that if the friar have not fling himselfoff the mule he would have bring him to the ground against hi will and sore wounded if not kill outright the second brother see how hi comrade be treat drove hi heel into hi castle of a mule and make off across the country faster than the wind sancho panza when he saw the friar on the ground dismount briskly from hi as rush towards him and begin to strip off hi gown at that instant the friar muleteer come up and ask what he be strip him for sancho answer them that this fell to him lawfully a spoil of the battle which hi lord don quixote have win the muleteer who have no idea of a joke and do not understand all this about battle and spoil see that don quixote be some distance off talk to the traveller in the coach fell upon sancho knock him down and leave hardly a hair in hi beard belabour him with kick and leave him stretch breathless and senseless on the ground and without any more delay help the friar to mount who tremble terrify and pale as soon a he find himselfin the saddle spur after hi companion who be stand at a distance look on watch the result of the onslaught then not care to wait for the end of the affair just begin they pursue their journey make more cross than if they have the devil after them don quixote be a have be say speak to the lady in the coach your beauty lady mine say he may now dispose of your person a may be most in accordance with your pleasure for the pride of your ravisher lie prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine and l you should be pin to know the name of your deliverer know that i be call

should return to el toboso and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what i have do to set you free one of the squire in attendance upon the coach a biscayan be listen to all don quixote be say and perceive that he would not allow the coach to go on but be say it must return at once to el toboso he make at him and seize hi lance address him in bad castilian and bad biscayan after hi fashion begone caballero and ill go with thee by the god that make me unless thou quittest coach slayest thee a art here a biscayan don quixote understand him quite well and answer him very

saw him come on though he wish to dismount from hi mule in which be one of those sorry one let out for hire he have no confidence have no choice but to draw hi sword it be lucky for him however that he be near the coach from which he be able to snatch a cushion that serve him for a shield and they go at one another a if they have be two mortal enemy the other strive to make peace between them but could not for the biscayan declare in hi disjointed phrase that if they do not let him finish hi battle he would kill hi mistress and everyone that strive to prevent him the lady in the coach amaze and terrify at what she saw order the coachman to draw aside a little and set herself to watch this severe struggle in the course of which the biscayan smote don quixote a mighty stroke on the

resolve to follow hi example so he wait for him keep well under cover of hi cushion be unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with hi mule which dead tire and never mean for this kind of game could

and under the protection of hi cushion and all present stand tremble wait in suspense the result of blow such a threaten to fall and the lady in the coach and the rest of her follow be make a thousand vow and offering to all the image and shrine of spain that god might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they find themselves but it spoil all that at this point and crisis the author of the history leave this battle impend give a excuse that he could find nothing more write about these achievement of don quixote than what have be already set forth it be true the second author of this work be unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have be allow to fall under the sentence of oblivion or that the wit of la mancha could have be so undiscerning a not to preserve in their archive or registry some document refer to this famous knight and this be hi persuasion he do not despair of find the conclusion of this pleasant history which heaven favour him he do find in a way that shall be relate in the second part chapter ix in which is concluded and finished the terrific battle between the gallant biscayan and the valiant manchegan in the first part of this history we leave the valiant biscayan and the renowned don quixote with drawn sword uplift ready to deliver two such furious slash blow that if they have fall full and fair they would at least have split and cleave them asunder from top to toe and lay them open like a pomegranate and at this so critical point the delightful history come to a stop and stand cut short without any intimation from the author where what be miss be to be find this distressed me greatly because the pleasure derive from have read such a small portion turn to vexation at the thought of the poor chance that present itself of find the large part that so it seem to me be miss of such an interesting tale it appear to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have be without some sage to undertake the task of write hi marvellous achievement a thing that be never want to any of those knightserrant who they say go after adventure for every one of them have one or two sage a if make on purpose who not only record their deed but describe their most trifling thought and folly however secret they might be and such a good knight could not have be so unfortunate a not to have what platir and other like him have in abundance and so i could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale have be leave maim and mutilate and i lay the blame on time the devourer and destroyer of all thing that have either conceal or consume it on the other hand it strike me that inasmuch a among hi book there have be find such modern one a the enlightenment of jealousy and the nymph and shepherd of henares hi story must likewise be modern and that though it might not be write it might exist in the memory of the people of hi village and of those in the neighbourhood this reflection keep me perplexed and long to know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deed of our famous spaniard don quixote of la mancha light and mirror of manchegan chivalry and the first that in our age and in these so evil day devote himselfto the labour and exercise of the arm of knighterrantry right wrong succour widow and protect damsel of that sort that use to ride about whip in hand on their palfrey with all their virginity about them from mountain to mountain and valley to valleyfor if it be not for some ruffian or boor with a hood and hatchet or monstrous giant that force them there be in day of yore damsel that at the end of eighty year in all which time they have never sleep a day under a roof go to their graf a much maid a the mother that bore them i say then that in these and other respect our gallant don quixote be worthy of everlasting and notable praise nor should it be withhold even from me for the labour and pain spend in search for the conclusion of this delightful history though i know well that if heaven chance and good fortune have not help me the world would have remain deprive of an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hour or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively the discovery of it occur in this way one day a i be in the alcana of toledo a boy come up to sell some pamphlet and old paper to a silk mercer and a i be fond of read even the very scrap of paper in the street lead by this natural bent of mine i take up one of the pamphlet the boy have for sale and saw that it be in character which i recognise a arabic and a i be unable to read them though i could recognise them i look about to see if there be any spanishspeaking morisco at hand to read them for me nor be there any great difficulty in find such an interpreter for even have i seek one for an old and good language i should have find him in short chance provide me with one who when i tell him what i want and put the book into hi hand open it in the middle and after read a little in it begin to laugh i ask him what he be laugh at and he reply that it be at something the book have write in the margin by way of a note i bid him tell it to me and he still laugh say in the margin a i tell you this be write this dulcinea del toboso so often mention in this history have they say the best hand of any woman in all la mancha for salt pig when i hear dulcinea del toboso name i be strike with surprise and amazement for it occur to me at once that these pamphlet contain the history of don quixote with this idea i press him to read the beginning and do so turn the arabic offhand into castilian he tell me it mean history of don quixote of la mancha write by cide hamete benengeli an arab historian it require great caution to hide the joy i felt when the title of the book reach my ear and snatch it from the silk mercer i buy all the paper and pamphlet from the boy for half a real and if he have have hi wit about him and have know how eager i be for them he might have safely calculate on make more than six real by the bargain i withdraw at once with the morisco into the cloister of the cathedral and beg him to turn all these pamphlet that relate to don quixote into the castilian tongue without omit or add anything to them offer him whatever payment he please he be satisfy with two arroba of raisin and two bushel of wheat and promise to translate them faithfully and with all despatch but to make the matter easy and not to let such a precious find out of my hand i take him to my house where in little more than a month and a half he translate the whole just a it be set down here in the first pamphlet the battle between don quixote and the biscayan be draw to the very life they plant in the same attitude a the history describe their sword raise and the one protect by hi buckler the other by hi cushion and the biscayans mule so true to nature that it could be see to be a hired one a bowshot off the biscayan have an inscription under hi foot which say don sancho de azpeitia which no doubt must have be hi name and at the foot of rocinante be another that say don quixote rocinante be marvellously portray so long and thin so lank and lean with so much backbone and so far go in consumption that he show plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of rocinante have be bestow upon him near him be sancho panza hold the halter of hi as at whose foot be another label that say sancho zancas and accord to the picture he must have have a big belly a short body and long shank for which reason no doubt the name of panza and zancas be give him for by these two surname the history several time call him some other trifle particular might be mention but they be all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the history and no history can be bad so long a it be true if against the present one any objection be raise on the score of it truth it can only be that it author be an arab a lying be a very common propensity with those of that nation though a they be such enemy of ours it be conceivable that there be omission rather than addition make in the course of it and this be my own opinion for where he could and should give freedom to hi pen in praise of so worthy a knight he seem to me deliberately to pass it over in silence which be ill do and bad contrive for it be the business and duty of historian to be exact truthful and wholly free from passion and neither interest nor fear hatred nor love should make them swerve from the path of truth whose mother be history rival of time storehouse of deed witness for the past example and counsel for the present and warn for the future in this i know will be find all that can be desire in the pleasantest and if it be want in any good quality i maintain it be the fault of it hound of an author and not the fault of the subject to be brief it second part accord to the translation begin in this way with trenchant sword upraised and poise on high it seem a though the two valiant and wrathful combatant stand threaten heaven and earth and hell with such resolution and determination do they bear themselves the fiery biscayan be the first to strike a blow which be deliver with such force and fury that have not the sword turn in it course that single stroke would have suffice to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all the adventure of our knight but that good fortune which reserve him for great thing turn aside the sword of hi adversary so that although it smite him upon the left shoulder it do him no more harm than to strip all that side of it armour carry away a great part of hi helmet with half of hi ear all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground leave him in a sorry plight good god who be there that could properly describe the rage that fill the heart of our manchegan when he saw himselfdealt with in this fashion all that can be say be it be such that he again raise himselfin hi stirrup and grasp hi sword more firmly with both hand he come down on the biscayan with such fury smite him full over the cushion and over the head thateven so good a shield prove uselessas if a mountain have fall on him he begin to bleed from nose mouth and ear reel a if about to fall backwards from hi mule a no doubt he would have do have he not fling hi arm about it neck at the same time however he slip hi foot out of the stirrup and then unclasp hi arm and the mule take fright at the terrible blow make off across the plain and with a few plunge fling it master to the ground don quixote stand look on very calmly and when he saw him fall leap from hi horse and with great briskness run to him and present the point of hi sword to hi eye bid him surrender or he would cut hi head off the biscayan be so bewildered that he be unable to answer a word and it would have go hard with him so blind be don quixote have not the lady in the coach who have hitherto be watch the combat in great terror hasten to where he stand and implore him with earnest entreaty to grant them the great grace and favour of spar their squire life to which don quixote reply with much gravity and dignity in truth fair lady i be well content to do what ye ask of me but it must be on one condition and understanding which be that this knight promise me to go to the village of el toboso and on my behalf present himselfbefore the peerless lady dulcinea that she deal with him a shall be most pleasing to her the terrified and disconsolate lady without discuss don quixotes demand or ask who dulcinea might be promise that their squire should do all that have be command then on the faith of that promise say don quixote i shall do him no further harm though he well deserve it of me chapter x of the pleasant discourse that passed between don quixote and hi squire sancho panza now by this time sancho have rise rather the worse for the handling of the friar muleteer and stand watch the battle of hi master don quixote and pray to god in hi heart that it might be hi will to grant him the victory and that he might thereby win some island to make him governor of a he have promise see therefore that the struggle be now over and that hi master be return to mount rocinante he approach to hold the stirrup for him and before he could mount he go on hi knee before him and take hi hand kiss it say may it please your worship senor don quixote to give me the government of that island which have be win in this hard fight for be it ever so big i feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it a much and as well a anyone in the world who have ever govern island to which don quixote reply thou must take notice brother sancho that this adventure and those like it be not adventure of island but of crossroad in which nothing be get except a broken head or an ear the less have patience for adventure will present themselves from which i may make you not only a governor but something more sancho give him many thanks and again kiss hi hand and the skirt of hi hauberk help him to mount rocinante and mount hi as himselfproceed to follow hi master who at a brisk pace without take leave or say anything far to the lady belong to the coach turn into a wood that be hard by sancho follow him at hi ass best trot but rocinante step out so that see himselfleave behind he be force to call to hi master to wait for him don quixote do so rein in rocinante until hi weary squire come up who on reach him say it seem to me senor it would be prudent in u to go and take refuge in some church for see how maul he with whom you fight have be leave it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the holy brotherhood and arrest u and faith if they do before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it peace say don quixote where hast thou ever see or hear that a knighterrant have be arraign before a court of justice however many homicide he may have commit i know nothing about omecils answer sancho nor in my life have have anything to do with one i only know that the holy brotherhood look after those who fight in the field and in that other matter i do not meddle then thou needst have no uneasiness my friend say don quixote for i will deliver thee out of the hand of the chaldean much more out of those of the brotherhood but tell me a thou liv hast thou see a more valiant knight than i in all the know world hast thou read in history of any who have or have high mettle in attack more spirit in maintain it more dexterity in wound or skill in overthrow the truth be answer sancho that i have never read any history for i can neither read nor write but what i will venture to bet be that a more daring master than your worship i have never serve in all the day of my life and god grant that this dare be not pay for where i have say what i beg of your worship be to dress your wound for a great deal of blood flow from that ear and i have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas all that might be well dispense with say don quixote if i have remember to make a vial of the balsam of fierabras for time and medicine be save by one single drop what vial and what balsam be that say sancho panza it be a balsam answer don quixote the receipt of which i have in my memory with which one need have no fear of death or dread dying of any wound and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the bodyas be wont to happen frequentlybut neatly and with great nicety ere the blood congeal to place that portion of the body which shall have fall to the ground upon the other half which remain in the saddle take care to fit it on evenly and exactly then thou shalt give me to drink but two drop of the balsam i have mention and thou shalt see me become sound than an apple if that be so say panza i renounce henceforth the government of the promised island and desire nothing more in payment of my many and faithful service than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme liquor for i be persuade it will be worth more than two real an ounce anywhere and i want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and honour but it remain to be tell if it cost much to make it with less than three real six quart of it may be make say don quixote sinner that i be say sancho then why do your worship put off make it and teach it to me peace friend answer don quixote great secret i mean to teach thee and great favour to bestow upon thee and for the present let u see to the dressing for my ear pain me more than i could wish sancho take out some lint and ointment from the alforjas but when don quixote come to see hi helmet shatter he be like to lose hi sens and clap hi hand upon hi sword and raise hi eye to heaven be say i swear by the creator of all thing and the four gospel in their full extent to do a the great marquis of mantua do when he swear to avenge the death of hi nephew baldwin and that be not to eat bread from a tablecloth nor embrace hi wife and other point which though i can not now call them to mind i here grant a express until i take complete vengeance upon him who have commit such an offence against me hear this sancho say to him your worship should bear in mind senor don quixote that if the knight have do what be command him in go to present himselfbefore my lady dulcinea del toboso he will have do all that he be bind to do and do not deserve further punishment unless he commit some new offence thou hast say well and hit the point answer don quixote and so i recall the oath in so far a relates to take fresh vengeance on him but i make and confirm it anew to lead the life i have say until such time a i take by force from some knight another helmet such a this and a good and think not sancho that i be raise smoke with straw in do so for i have one to imitate in the matter since the very same thing to a hair happen in the case of mambrinos helmet which cost sacripante so dear senor reply sancho let your worship send all such oath to the devil for they be very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience just tell me now if for several day to come we fall in with no man arm with a helmet what be we to do be the oath to be observe in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in your clothes and not to sleep in a house and a thousand other mortification contain in the oath of that old fool the marquis of mantua which your worship be now want to revive let your worship observe that there be no men in armour travel on any of these road nothing but carrier and carter who not only do not wear helmet but perhaps never hear tell of them all their life thou art wrong there say don quixote for we shall not have be above two hour among these crossroad before we see more men in armour than come to albraca to win the fair angelica enough say sancho so be it then and god grant u success and that the time for win that island which be cost me so dear may soon come and then let me die i have already tell thee sancho say don quixote not to give thyself any uneasiness on that score for if an island should fail there be the kingdom of denmark or of sobradisa which will fit thee a a ring fit the finger and all the more that be on terra firma thou wilt all the good enjoy thyself but let u leave that to it own time see if thou hast anything for u to eat in those alforjas because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge tonight and make the balsam i tell thee of for i swear to thee by god this ear be give me great pain i have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scrap of bread say sancho but they be not victual fit for a valiant knight like your worship how little thou knowest about it answer don quixote i would have thee to know sancho that it be the glory of knightserrant to go without eat for a month and even when they do eat that it should be of what come first to hand and this would have be clear to thee hadst thou read a many history a i have for though they be very many among them all i have find no mention make of knightserrant eat unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquet prepare for them and the rest of the time they pass in dalliance and though it be plain they could not do without eating and perform all the other natural function because in fact they be men like ourselves it be plain too that wander a they do the most part of their life through wood and wild and without a cook their most usual fare would be rustic viand such a those thou now offer me so that friend sancho let not that distress thee which please me and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knighterrantry pardon me your worship say sancho for a i can not read or write a i say just now i neither know nor comprehend the rule of the profession of chivalry henceforward i will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship a you be a knight and for myself a i be not one i will furnish them with poultry and other thing more substantial i do not say sancho reply don quixote that it be imperative on knightserrant not to eat anything els but the fruit thou speakest of only that their more usual diet must be those and certain herb they find in the field which they know and i know too a good thing it be answer sancho to know those herb for to my think it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice and here take out what he say he have bring the pair make their repast peaceably and sociably but anxious to find quarter for the night they with all despatch make an end of their poor dry fare mount at once and make haste to reach some habitation before night set in but daylight and the hope of succeed in their object fail them close by the hut of some goatherd so they determine to pass the night there and it be as much to sanchos discontent not to have reach a house a it be to hi master satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven for he fancy that each time this happen to him he perform an act of ownership that help to prove hi chivalry chapter xi what befell don quixote with certain goatherd he be cordially welcome by the goatherd and sancho have as best he could put up rocinante and the as draw towards the fragrance that come from some piece of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire and though he would have like at once to try if they be ready to be transfer from the pot to the stomach he refrain from do so a the goatherd remove them from the fire and laying sheepskin on the ground quickly spread their rude table and with sign of hearty goodwill invite them both to share what they have round the skin six of the men belong to the fold seat themselves have first with rough politeness press don quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they place for him upside down don quixote seat himselfand sancho remain stand to serve the cup which be make of horn see him stand hi master say to him that thou mayest see sancho the good that knighterrantry contains in itself and how those who fill any office in it be on the high road to be speedily honour and esteem by the world i desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people and that thou be one with me who be thy master and natural lord and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever i drink from for the same may be say of knighterrantry a of love that it level all great thanks say sancho but i may tell your worship that provide i have enough to eat i can eat it as well or good standing and by myself than seat alongside of an emperor and indeed if the truth be to be tell what i eat in my corner without form or fuss have much more relish for me even though it be bread and onion than the turkey of those other table where i be force to chew slowly drink little wipe my mouth every minute and can not sneeze or cough if i want or do other thing that be the privilege of liberty and solitude so senor a for these honour which your worship would put upon me a a servant and follower of knighterrantry exchange them for other thing which may be of more use and advantage to me for these though i fully acknowledge them a receive i renounce from this moment to the end of the world for all that say don quixote thou must seat thyself because him who humbleth himselfgod exalteth and seize him by the arm he force him to sit down beside himselfthe goatherd do not understand this jargon about squire and knightserrant and all they do be to eat in silence and stare at their guest who with great elegance and appetite be stow away piece as big a one fist the course of meat finish they spread upon the sheepskin a great heap of parched acorn and with them they put down a half cheese hard than if it have be make of mortar all this while the horn be not idle for it go round so constantly now full now empty like the bucket of a waterwheel that it soon drain one of the two wineskin that be in sight when don quixote have quite appease hi appetite he take up a handful of the acorn and contemplate them attentively deliver himselfsomewhat in this fashion happy the age happy the time to which the ancient give the name of golden not because in that fortunate age the gold so covet in this our iron one be gain without toil but because they that live in it know not the two word mine and thine in that bless age all thing be in common to win the daily food no labour be require of any save to stretch forth hi hand and gather it from the sturdy oak that stand generously invite him with their sweet ripe fruit the clear stream and run brook yield their savoury limpid water in noble abundance the busy and sagacious bee fix their republic in the cleft of the rock and hollow of the tree offer without usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand the mighty cork tree unenforced save of their own courtesy shed the broad light bark that serve at first to roof the house support by rude stake a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone then all be peace all friendship all concord a yet the dull share of the crooked plough have not dare to rend and pierce the tender bowel of our first mother that without compulsion yield from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy sustain and delight the child that then possess her then be it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roam from vale to vale and hill to hill with flow lock and no more garment than be needful modestly to cover what modesty seek and ever seek to hide nor be their ornament like those in use today set off by tyrian purple and silk torture in endless fashion but the wreathed leaf of the green dock and ivy wherewith they go a bravely and becomingly deck a our court dam with all the rare and farfetched artifice that idle curiosity have teach them then the lovethoughts of the heart clothe themselves simply and naturally a the heart conceive them nor seek to commend themselves by force and ramble verbiage fraud deceit or malice have then not yet mingle with truth and sincerity justice hold her ground undisturbed and unassailed by the effort of favour and of interest that now so much impair pervert and beset her arbitrary law have not yet establish itself in the mind of the judge for then there be no cause to judge and no one to be judge maiden and modesty a i have say wander at will alone and unattended without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault and if they be undone it be of their own will and pleasure but now in this hateful age of ours not one be safe not though some new labyrinth like that of crete conceal and surround her even there the pestilence of gallantry will make it way to them through chink or on the air by the zeal of it accursed importunity and despite of all seclusion lead them to ruin in defence of these a time advanced and wickedness increase the order of knightserrant be institute to defend maiden to protect widow and to succour the orphan and the needy to this order i belong brother goatherd to whom i return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire for though by natural law all living be bind to show favour to knightserrant yet see that without know this obligation ye have welcome and feast me it be right that with all the goodwill in my power i should thank you for yours all this long harangue which might very well have be spar our knight deliver because the acorn they give him remind him of the golden age and the whim seize him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherd who listen to him gap in amazement without say a word in reply sancho likewise hold hi peace and ate acorn and pay repeat visit to the second wineskin which they have hang up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool don quixote be longer in talk than the supper in finish at the end of which one of the goatherd say that your worship senor knighterrant may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready goodwill we will give you amusement and pleasure by make one of our comrade sing he will be here before long and he be a very intelligent youth and deep in love and what be more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection the goatherd have hardly do speaking when the note of the rebeck reach their ear and shortly after the player come up a very goodlooking young man of about twoandtwenty hi comrade ask him if he have sup and on hi replying that he have he who have already make the offer say to him in that case antonio thou mayest as well do u the pleasure of sing a little

pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary make thee and that be so much like in the town with all my heart say the young man and without wait for more pressing he seat himselfon the trunk of a felled oak and tune hi rebeck presently begin to sing to these word antoniosballad thou dost love me well olalla well i know it even though love mute tongue thine eye have never by their glance tell me so for i know my love thou knowest therefore thine to claim i dare once it cease to be secret love need never feel despair true it be olalla sometimes thou hast all

lure to faith be they those glimpse and to faith in thee i hold kindness can not make it strong coldness can not make it cold if it be that love be gentle in thy gentleness i see something hold out assurance to the hope of win thee if it be that in devotion lie a power heart to move that which every day i show thee helpful to my suit should prove many a time thou must have notice if to notice

affection mine no passion par amour a they call itwhat i offer be an honest love and pure cunning cord the holy church have cord of soft silk they be put thy neck beneath the yoke dear mine will follow thou wilt see elseand once for all i swear it by the saint of most renown if i ever quit the mountain t will be in a friar gown here the goatherd bring hi song to an end and though don quixote entreat him to sing more sancho have no mind that way be more inclined for sleep than for listen to song so say he to hi master your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night for the labour these good men be at all day do not allow them to spend the night in sing i understand thee sancho reply don quixote i perceive clearly that those visit to the wineskin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music it sweet to u all bless be god say sancho i do not deny it reply don quixote but settle thyself where thou wilt those of my call be more becomingly employ in watch than in sleep still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again for it be give me more pain than it need sancho do a he bid him but one of the goatherd see the wound tell him not to be uneasy a he would apply a remedy with which it would be soon heal and gather some leaf of rosemary of which there be a great quantity there he chew them and mix them with a little salt and apply them to the ear he secure them firmly with a bandage assure him that no other treatment would be require and so it prove chapter xii of what a goatherd related to those with don quixote just then another young man one of those who fetch their provision from the village come up and say do you know what be go on in the village comrades how could we know it reply one of them well then you must know continue the young man this morning that famous studentshepherd call chrysostom die and it be rumour that he die of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of guillermo the rich

what have lead them to make so extraordinary a change about this time the father of our chrysostom die and he be leave heir to a large amount of property in chattel as well a in land no small number of cattle and sheep and a large sum of money of all of which the young man be leave dissolute owner and indeed he be deserve of it all for he be a very good comrade and kindhearted and a friend of worthy folk and have a countenance like a benediction presently it come to be know that he have change hi dress with no other object than to wander about these waste after that shepherdess marcela our lad mention a while ago with whom the deceased chrysostom have fall in love and i must tell you now for it be well you should know it who this girl be perhaps and even without any perhaps you will not have hear anything like it all the day of your life though you should live more year than sarna say sarra say don quixote unable to endure the goatherd confusion of word the sarna live long enough answer pedro and if senor you must go find fault with word at every step we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth pardon me friend say don quixote but a there be such a difference between sarna and sarra i tell you of it however you have answer very rightly for sarna life longer than sarra so continue your story and i will not object any more to anything i say then my dear sir say the goatherd that in our village there be a farmer even rich than the father of chrysostom who be name guillermo and upon whom god bestow over and above great wealth a daughter at whose birth her mother die the most respected woman there be in this neighbourhood i fancy i can see her now with that countenance which have the sun on one side and the moon on the other and moreover active and kind to the poor for which i trust that at the present moment her soul be in bliss with god in the other world her husband guillermo die of grief at the death of so good a wife leave hi daughter marcela a child and rich to the care of an uncle of hers a priest and prebendary in our village the girl grow up with such beauty that it remind u of her mother which be very great and yet it be think that the daughter would exceed it and so when she reach the age of fourteen to fifteen year nobody behold her but bless god that have make her so beautiful and the great number be in love with her past redemption her uncle keep her in great seclusion and retirement but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that as well for it a for her great wealth her uncle be ask solicited and importune to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many league round and by the person of high quality in them but he be a good christian man though he desire to give her in marriage at once see her to be old enough be unwilling to do so without her consent not that he have any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl property bring him while he put off her marriage and faith this be say in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town for i would have you know sir errant that in these little village everything be talk about and everything be carp at and rest assure a i be that the priest must be over and above good who force hi parishioner to speak well of him especially in village that be the truth say don quixote but go on for the story be very good and you good pedro tell it with very good grace may that of the lord not be want to me say pedro that be the one to have to proceed you must know that though the uncle put before hi niece and described to her the quality of each one in particular of the many who have ask her in marriage beg her to marry and make a choice accord to her own taste she never give any other answer than that she have no desire to marry just yet and that be so young she do not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony at these to all appearance reasonable excuse that she make her uncle cease to urge her and wait till she be somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her own liking for say heand he say quite rightparents be not to settle child in life against their will but when one least look for it lo and behold one day the demure marcela make her appearance turn shepherdess and in spite of her uncle and all those of the town that strive to dissuade her take to go afield with the other shepherdlasses of the village and tend her own flock and so since she appear in public and her beauty come to be see openly i could not well tell you how many rich youth gentleman and peasant have adopt the costume of chrysostom and go about these field make love to her one of these a have be already say be our deceased friend of whom they say that he do not love but adore her but you must not suppose because marcela choose a life of such liberty and independence and of so little or rather no retirement that she have give any occasion or even the semblance of one for disparagement of her purity and modesty on the contrary such and so great be the vigilance with which she watch over her honour that of all those that court and woo her not one have boast or can with truth boast that she have give him any hope however small of obtain hi desire for although she do not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherd and treat them courteously and kindly should any one of them come to declare hi intention to her though it be one a proper and holy a that of matrimony she fling him from her like a catapult and with this kind of disposition she do more harm in this country than if the plague have get into it for her affability and her beauty draw on the heart of those that associate with her to love her and to court her but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hardhearted and other name of the same sort which well describe the nature of her character and if you should remain here any time senor you would hear these hill and valley resound with the lament of the reject one who pursue her not far from this there be a spot where there be a couple of dozen of tall beech and there be not one of them but have carve and write on it smooth bark the name of marcela and above some a crown carve on the same tree a though her lover would say more plainly that marcela wear and deserve that of all human beauty here one shepherd be sigh there another be lament there love song be hear here despair elegy one will pass all the hour of the night seat at the foot of some oak or rock and there without have close hi weep eye the sun find him in the morning bemuse and bereft of sense and another without relief or respite to hi sigh stretch on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide make hi appeal to the compassionate heaven and over one and the other over these and all the beautiful marcela triumph free and careless and all of u that know her be wait to see what her pride will come to and who be to be the happy man that will succeed in tame a nature so formidable and gain possession of a beauty so supreme all that i have tell you be such wellestablished truth i be persuade that what they say of the cause of chrysostoms death a our lad tell u be the same and so i advise you senor fail not to be present tomorrow at hi burial which will be well worth see for chrysostom have many friend and it be not half a league from this place to where he direct he should be bury i will make a point of it say don quixote and i thank you for the pleasure you have give me by relate so interest a tale oh say the goatherd i do not know even the half of what have happen to the lover of marcela but perhaps tomorrow we may fall in with some shepherd on the road who can tell u and now it will be well for you to go and sleep under cover for the night air may hurt your wound though with the remedy i have apply to you there be no fear of an untoward result sancho panza who be wish the goatherd loquacity at the devil on hi part beg hi master to go into pedros hut to sleep he do so and pass all the rest of the night in thinking of hi lady dulcinea in imitation of the lover of marcela sancho panza settle himselfbetween rocinante and hi as and sleep not like a lover who have be discard but like a man who have be soundly kick chapter xiii in which is ended the story of the shepherdess marcela with other incident bit hardly have day begin to show itself through the balcony of the east when five of the six goatherd come to rouse don quixote and tell him that if he be still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of chrysostom they would bear him company don quixote who desire nothing better rise and order sancho to saddle and pannel at once which he do with all despatch and with the same they all set out forthwith they have not go a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two path they saw come towards them some six shepherd dress in black sheepskin and with their head crown with garland of cypress and bitter oleander each of them carry a stout holly staff in hi hand and along with them there come two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress with three servant on foot accompany them courteous salutation be exchange on meeting and inquire one of the other which way each party be go they learn that all be bind for the scene of the burial so they go on all together one of those on horseback address hi companion say to him it seem to me senor vivaldo that we may reckon as well spend the delay we shall incur in see this remarkable funeral for remarkable it can not but be judge by the strange thing these shepherd have tell u of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess so i think too replied vivaldo and i would delay not to say a day but four for the sake of see it don quixote ask them what it be they have hear of marcela and chrysostom the traveller answer that the same morning they have meet these shepherd and see them dress in this mournful fashion they have ask them the reason of their appear in such a guise which one of them give describe the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess call marcela and the love of many who court her together with the death of that chrysostom to whose burial they be go in short he repeat all that pedro have relate to don quixote this conversation drop and another be commence by him who be call vivaldo ask don quixote what be the reason that lead him to go arm in that fashion in a country so peaceful to which don quixote reply the pursuit of my call do not allow or permit me to go in any other fashion easy life enjoyment and repose be invent for soft courtier but toil unrest and arm be invent and make for those alone whom the world call knightserrant of whom i though unworthy be the least of all the instant they hear this all set him down a mad and the good to settle the point and discover what kind of madness hi be vivaldo proceed to ask him what knightserrant meant have not your worship reply don quixote read the annals and history of england in which be record the famous deed of king arthur whom we in our popular castilian invariably call king artus with regard to whom it be an ancient tradition and commonly receive all over that kingdom of great britain that this king do not die but be change by magic art into a raven and that in process of time he be to return to reign and recover hi kingdom and sceptre for which reason it can not be prove that from that time to this any englishman ever kill a raven well then in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of the knight of the round table be institute and the amour of don lancelot of the lake with the queen guinevere occur precisely a be there relate the gobetween and confidante therein be the highly honourable dame quintanona whence come that ballad so well know and widely spread in our spain o never surely be there knight so serve by hand of dame a served be he sir lancelot hight when he from britain come with all the sweet and delectable course of hi achievement in love and war hand down from that time then this order of chivalry go on extending and spread itself over many and various part of the world and in it famous and renowned for their deed be the mighty amadis of gaul with all hi son and descendant to the fifth generation and the valiant felixmarte of hircania and the never sufficiently praise tirante el blanco and in our own day almost we have see and hear and talk with the invincible knight don belianis of greece this then sirs be to be a knighterrant and what i have speak of be the order of hi chivalry of which a i have already say i though a sinner have make profession and what the aforesaid knight profess that same do i profess and so i go through these solitude and wild seek adventure resolve in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy by these word of hi the traveller be able to satisfy themselves of don quixotes be out of hi sens and of the form of madness that overmaster him at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt on first become acquaint with it and vivaldo who be a person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament in order to beguile the short journey which they say be require to reach the mountain the scene of the burial sought to give him an opportunity of go on with hi absurdity so he say to him it seem to me senor knighterrant that your worship have make choice of one of the most austere profession in the world and i imagine even that of the carthusian monk be not so austere a austere it may perhaps be reply our don quixote but so necessary for the world i be very much incline to doubt for if the truth be to be tell the soldier who execute what hi captain order do no less than the captain himselfwho give the order my meaning be that churchman in peace and quiet pray to heaven for the welfare of the world but we soldier and knight carry into effect what they pray for defend it with the might of our arm and the edge of our sword not under shelter but in the open air a target for the intolerable ray of the sun in summer and the piercing frost of winter thus be we god minister on earth and the arm by which hi justice be do therein and a the business of war and all that relate and belong to it can not be conduct without exceed great sweat toil and exertion it follow that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet be engage in pray to god to help the weak i do not mean to say nor do it enter into my thought that the knighterrants call be as good a that of the monk in hi cell i would merely infer from what i endure myself that it be beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one a hungrier and thirstier a wretcheder raggeder and lousy for there be no reason to doubt that the knightserrant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their life and if some of them by the might of their arm do rise to be emperor in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat and if those who attain to that rank have not have magician and sage to help them they would have be completely baulk in their ambition and disappoint in their hope that be my own opinion reply the traveller but one thing among many other seem to me very wrong in knightserrant and that be that when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous adventure in which there be manifest danger of lose their life they never at the moment of engage in it think of commend themselves to god a be the duty of every good christian in like peril instead of which they commend themselves to their lady with as much devotion a if these be their god a thing which seem to me to savour somewhat of heathenism sir answer don quixote that can not be on any account omit and the knighterrant would be disgrace who act otherwise for it be usual and customary in knighterrantry that the knighterrant who on engage in any great feat of arm have hi lady before him should turn hi eye towards her softly and lovingly a though with them entreat her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he be about to undertake and even though no one hear him he be bind to say certain word between hi teeth commend himselfto her with all hi heart and of this we have innumerable instance in the history nor be it to be suppose from this that they be to omit commend themselves to god for there will be time and opportunity for do so while they be engage in their task for all that answer the traveller i feel some doubt still because often i have read how word will arise between two knightserrant and from one thing to another it come about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horse round and take a good stretch of field and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge and in midcareer they be wont to commend themselves to their lady and what commonly come of the encounter be that one fall over the haunch of hi horse pierce through and through by hi antagonist lance and a for the other it be only by hold on to the mane of hi horse that he can help fall to the ground but i know not how the dead man have time to commend himselfto god in the course of such rapid work a this it would have be good if those word which he spend in commend himselfto hi lady in the midst of hi career have be devote to hi duty and obligation a a christian moreover it be my belief that all knightserrant have not lady to commend themselves to for they be not all in love that be impossible say don quixote i say it be impossible that there could be a knighterrant without a lady because to such it be a natural and proper to be in love a to the heaven to have star most certainly no history have be see in which there be to be find a knighterrant without an amour and for the simple reason that without one he would be hold no legitimate knight but a bastard and one who have gain entrance into the stronghold of the say knighthood not by the door but over the wall like a thief and a robber nevertheless say the traveller if i remember rightly i think i have read that don galaor the brother of the valiant amadis of gaul never have any special lady to whom he might commend himselfand yet he be not the le esteem and be a very stout and famous knight to which our don quixote make answer sir one solitary swallow do not make summer moreover i know that knight be in secret very deeply in love besides which that way of fall in love with all that take hi fancy be a natural propensity which he could not control but in short it be very manifest that he have one alone whom he make mistress of hi will to whom he commend himselfvery frequently and very secretly for he pride himselfon be a reticent knight then if it be essential that every knighterrant should be in love say the traveller it may be fairly suppose that your worship be so a you be of the order and if you do not pride yourself on be as reticent a don galaor i entreat you as earnestly a i can in the name of all this company and in my own to inform u of the name country rank and beauty of your lady for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world know that she be love and serve by such a knight a your worship seem to be at this don quixote heave a deep sigh and say i can not say positively whether my sweet enemy be pleased or not that the world should know i serve her i can only say in answer to what have be so courteously ask of me that her name be dulcinea her country el toboso a village of la mancha her rank must be at least that of a princess since she be my queen and lady and her beauty superhuman since all the impossible and fanciful attribute of beauty which the poet apply to their lady be verify in her for her hair be gold her forehead elysian field her eyebrow rainbows her eye sun her cheek roses her lips coral her teeth pearl her neck alabaster her bosom marble her hand ivory her fairness snow and what modesty conceals from sight such i think and imagine a rational reflection can only extol not compare we should like to know her lineage race and ancestry say vivaldo to which don quixote reply she be not of the ancient roman curtii caii or scipio nor of the modern colonnas or orsini nor of the moncadas or requesenes of catalonia nor yet of the rebellas or villanovas of valencia palafoxes nuzas rocabertis corellas luna alagones urreas foces or gurreas of aragon cerdas manriques mendozas or guzmans of castile alencastros pallas or meneses of portugal but she be of those of el toboso of la mancha a lineage that though modern may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious family of the age that be to come and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino place at the foot of the trophy of orlando arm say these let none move who dareth not hi might with roland prove although mine be of the cachopins of laredo say the traveller i will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha though to tell the truth no such surname have until now ever reach my ear what say don quixote have that never reach them the rest of the party go along listen with great attention to the conversation of the pair and even the very goatherd and shepherd perceive how exceedingly out of hi wit our don quixote be sancho panza alone think that what hi master say be the truth knowing who he be and have know him from hi birth and all that he felt any difficulty in believing be that about the fair dulcinea del toboso because neither any such name nor any such princess have ever come to hi knowledge though he live so close to el toboso they be go along converse in this way when they saw descend a gap between two high mountain some twenty shepherd all clothe in sheepskin of black wool and crown with garland which a afterwards appear be some of them of yew some of cypress six of the number be carry a bier cover with a great variety of flower and branch on see which one of the goatherd say those who come there be the bearer of chrysostoms body and the foot of that mountain be the place where he order them to bury him they therefore make haste to reach the spot and do so by the time those who come have lay the bier upon the ground and four of them with sharp pickax be dig a grave by the side of a hard rock they greet each other courteously and then don quixote and those who accompany him turn to examine the bier and on it cover with flower they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd to all appearance of one thirty year of age and show even in death that in life he have be of comely feature and gallant bearing around him on the bier itself be lay some book and several paper open and folded and those who be look on as well a those who be open the grave and all the other who be there preserve a strange silence until one of those who have bear the body say to another observe carefully ambrosia if this be the place chrysostom spoke of since you be anxious that what he direct in hi will should be so strictly comply with this be the place answer ambrosia for in it many a time do my poor friend tell me the story of hi hard fortune here it be he tell me that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race and here too for the first time he declare to her hi passion as honourable a it be devote and here it be that at last marcela end by scorn and reject him so a to bring the tragedy of hi wretched life to a close here in memory of misfortune so great he desire to be lay in the bowel of eternal oblivion then turn to don quixote and the traveller he go on to say that body sir on which you be look with compassionate eye be the abode of a soul on which heaven bestow a vast share of it rich that be the body of chrysostom who be unrivalled in wit unequalled in courtesy unapproached in gentle bear a phoenix in friendship generous without limit grave without arrogance gay without vulgarity and in short first in all that constitute goodness and second to none in all that make up misfortune he love deeply he be hat he adore he be scorn he woo a wild beast he plead with marble he pursue the wind he cry to the wilderness he serve ingratitude and for reward be make the prey of death in the midcourse of life cut short by a shepherdess whom he seek to immortalise in the memory of man a these paper which you see could fully prove have he not command me to consign them to the fire after have consign hi body to the earth you would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner himselfsay vivaldo for it be neither right nor proper to do the will of one who enjoin what be wholly unreasonable it would not have be reasonable in augustus caesar have he permit the direction leave by the divine mantuan in hi will to be carry into effect so that senor ambrosia while you consign your friend body to the earth you should not consign hi writing to oblivion for if he give the order in bitterness of heart it be not right that you should irrationally obey it on the contrary by grant life to those paper let the cruelty of marcela live for ever to serve a a warning in age to come to all men to shun and avoid fall into like danger or i and all of u who have come here know already the story of this your lovestricken and heartbroken friend and we know too your friendship and the cause of hi death and the direction he give at the close of hi life from which sad story may be gather how great be the cruelty of marcela the love of chrysostom and the loyalty of your friendship together with the end await those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion open to their eye last night we learn the death of chrysostom and that he be to be bury here and out of curiosity and pity we leave our direct road and resolve to come and see with our eye that which when heard of have so move our compassion and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence we beg of you excellent ambrosia or at least i on my own account entreat you that instead of burn those paper you allow me to carry away some of them and without wait for the shepherd answer he stretch out hi hand and take up some of those that be nearest to him see which ambrosio say out of courtesy senor i will grant your request a to those you have take but it be idle to expect me to abstain from burn the remainder vivaldo who be eager to see what the paper contain open one of them at once and saw that it title be lay of despair ambrosio hear it say that be the last paper the unhappy man write and that you may see senor to what an end hi misfortune bring him read it so that you may be hear for you will have time enough for that while we be wait for the grave to be dig i will do so very willingly say vivaldo and a all the bystander be equally eager they gather round him and he read in a loud voice find that it run a follow chapter xiv wherein are inserted the despairing verse of the dead shepherd together with other incident not looked for the lay of chrysostom since thou dost in thy cruelty desire the ruthless rigour of thy tyranny from tongue to tongue from land to land proclaim the very hell will i constrain to lend this stricken breast of mine deep note of woe to serve my need of fit utterance and a i strive to body forth the tale of all i suffer all that thou hast do forth shall the dread voice roll and bear along shred from my vitals tear for great pain then listen not to dulcet harmony but to a discord wrung by mad despair out of this bosoms depth of bitterness to ease my heart and plant a sting in thine the lion roar the fierce wolf savage howl the horrid hissing of the scaly snake the awesome cry of monster yet unnamed the crow illboding croak the hollow moan of wild wind wrestle with the restless sea the wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull the plaintive sobbing of the widow dove the envied owls sad note the wail of woe that rise from the dreary choir of hell commingled in one sound confuse sense let all these come to aid my soul complaint for pain like mine demand new mode of song no echo of that discord shall be hear where father tagus roll or on the bank of olivebordered betis to the rock or in deep cavern shall my plaint be tell and by a lifeless tongue in living word or in dark valley or on lonely shore where neither foot of man nor sunbeam fall or in among the poisonbreathing swarm of monster nourish by the sluggish nile for though it be to solitudes remote the hoarse vague echo of my sorrow sound thy matchless cruelty my dismal fate shall carry them to all the spacious world disdain hath power to kill and patience dy slain by suspicion be it false or true and deadly be the force of jealousy long absence make of life a dreary void no hope of happiness can give repose to him that ever fear to be forget and death inevitable wait in hall but i by some strange miracle live on a prey to absence jealousy disdain rack by suspicion a by certainty forgotten leave to fee my flame alone and while i suffer thus there come no ray of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom nor do i look for it in my despair but rather cling to a cureless woe all hope do i abjure for evermore can there be hope where fear be be it well when far more certain be the ground of fear ought i to shut mine eye to jealousy if through a thousand heartwounds it appear who would not give free access to distrust see disdain unveiled andbitter change all hi suspicion turn to certainty and the fair truth transform into a lie oh thou fierce tyrant of the realm of love oh jealousy put chain upon these hand and bind me with thy strong cord disdain but woe be me triumphant over all my suffering drown the memory of you and now i die and since there be no hope of happiness for me in life or death still to my fantasy ill fondly cling ill say that he be wise who loveth well and that the soul most free be that most bound in thraldom to the ancient tyrant love ill say that she who be mine enemy in that fair body hath a fair a mind and that her coldness be but my desert and that by virtue of the pain he send love rule hi kingdom with a gentle sway thus selfdeluding and in bondage sore and wear out the wretched shred of life to which i be reduce by her disdain ill give this soul and body to the wind all hopeless of a crown of bliss in store thou whose injustice hath supply the cause that make me quit the weary life i loathe a by this wounded bosom thou canst see how willingly thy victim i become let not my death if haply worth a tear cloud the clear heaven that dwell in thy bright eye i would not have thee expiate in aught the crime of have make my heart thy prey but rather let thy laughter gaily ring and prove my death to be thy festival fool that i be to bid thee well i know thy glory gain by my untimely end and now it be the time from hell aby come thirst tantalus come sisyphus heave the cruel stone come tityus with vulture and with wheel ixion come and come the sister of the ceaseless toil and all into this breast transfer their pain and if such tribute to despair be due chant in their deepest tone a doleful dirge over a corse unworthy of a shroud let the threeheaded guardian of the gate and all the monstrous progeny of hell the doleful concert join a lover dead methinks can have no fitter obsequies lay of despair grieve not when thou art go forth from this sorrow heart my misery brings fortune to the cause that give thee birth then banish sadness even in the tomb the lay of chrysostom meet with the approbation of the listener though the reader say it do not seem to him to agree with what he have hear of marcelas reserve and propriety for chrysostom complain in it of jealousy suspicion and absence all to the prejudice of the good name and fame of marcela to which ambrosio reply a one who know well hi friend most secret thought senor to remove that doubt i should tell you that when the unhappy man write this lay he be away from marcela from whom he have voluntarily separate himselfto try if absence would act with him a it be wont and a everything distress and every fear haunt the banished lover so imaginary jealousy and suspicion dread a if they be true torment chrysostom and thus the truth of what report declare of the virtue of marcela remain unshaken and with her envy itself should not and can not find any fault save that of be cruel somewhat haughty and very scornful that be true say vivaldo and a he be about to read another paper of those he have preserve from the fire he be stop by a marvellous vision for such it seem that unexpectedly present itself to their eye for on the summit of the rock where they be dig the grave there appear the shepherdess marcela so beautiful that her beauty exceed it reputation those who have never till then behold her gazed upon her in wonder and silence and those who be accustom to see her be not less amazed than those who have never see her before but the instant ambrosio saw her he address her with manifest indignation art thou come by chance cruel basilisk of these mountain to see if in thy presence blood will flow from the wound of this wretched be thy cruelty have rob of life or be it to exult over the cruel work of thy humour that thou art come or like another pitiless nero to look down from that height upon the ruin of hi rome in ember or in thy arrogance to trample on this illfated corpse a the ungrateful daughter trample on her father tarquin tell u quickly for what thou art come or what it be thou wouldst have for a i know the thought of chrysostom never fail to obey thee in life i will make all these who call themselves hi friend obey thee though he be dead i come not ambrosia for any of the purpose thou hast name replied marcela but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable be all those who blame me for their sorrow and for chrysostoms death and therefore i ask all of you that be here to give me your attention for will not take much time or many word to bring the truth home to person of sense heaven have make me so you say beautiful and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty lead you to love me and for the love you show me you say and even urge that i be bound to love you by that natural understanding which god have give me i know that everything beautiful attracts love but i can not see how by reason of be love that which be love for it beauty be bind to love that which love it besides it may happen that the lover of that which be beautiful may be ugly and ugliness be detestable it be very absurd to say i love thee because thou art beautiful thou must love me though i be ugly but suppose the beauty equal on both side it do not follow that the inclination must be therefore alike for it be not every beauty that excite love some but please the eye without win the affection and if every sort of beauty excite love and win the heart the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any for a there be an infinity of beautiful object there must be an infinity of inclination and true love i have hear it say be indivisible and must be voluntary and not compel if this be so a i believe it to be why do you desire me to bend my will by force for no other reason but that you say you love me naytell mehad heaven make me ugly a it have make me beautiful could i with justice complain of you for not love me moreover you must remember that the beauty i possess be no choice of mine for be it what it may heaven of it bounty give it me without my asking or choose it and a the viper though it kill with it do not deserve to be blame for the poison it carry a it be a gift of nature neither do i deserve reproach for be beautiful for beauty in a modest woman be like fire at a distance or a sharp sword the one do not burn the other do not cut those who do not come too near honour and virtue be the ornament of the mind without which the body though it be so have no right to pass for beautiful but if modesty be one of the virtue that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body why should she who be love for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for hi pleasure alone strive with all hi might and energy to rob her of it i be bear free and that i might live in freedom i choose the solitude of the field in the tree of the mountain i find society the clear water of the brook be my mirror and to the tree and water i make know my thought and charm i be a fire afar off a sword lay aside those whom i have inspire with love by let them see me i have by word undeceive and if their longing live on hopeand i have give none to chrysostom or to any otherit can not justly be say that the death of any be my do for it be rather hi own obstinacy than my cruelty that kill him and if it be make a charge against me that hi wish be honourable and that therefore i be bind to yield to them i answer that when on this very spot where now hi grave be make he declare to me hi purity of purpose i tell him that mine be to live in perpetual solitude and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruit of my retirement and the spoil of my beauty and if after this open avowal he choose to persist against hope and steer against the wind what wonder be it that he should sink in the depth of hi infatuation if i have encourage him i should be false if i have gratify him i should have act against my own good resolution and purpose he be persistent in spite of warn he despair without be hat bethink you now if it be reasonable that hi suffering should be lay to my charge let him who have be deceive complain let him give way to despair whose encouraged hope have prove vain let him flatter himselfwhom i shall entice let him boast whom i shall receive but let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom i make no promise upon whom i practise no deception whom i neither entice nor receive it have not be so far the will of heaven that i should love by fate and to expect me to love by choice be idle let this general declaration serve for each of my suitor on hi own account and let it be understand from this time forth that if anyone die for me it be not of jealousy or misery he die for she who love no one can give no cause for jealousy to any and candour be not to be confound with scorn let him who call me wild beast and basilisk leave me alone a something noxious and evil let him who call me ungrateful withhold hi service who call me wayward seek not my acquaintance who call me cruel pursue me not for this wild beast this basilisk this ungrateful cruel wayward be have no kind of desire to seek serve know or follow them if chrysostoms impatience and violent passion kill him why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be blame if i preserve my purity in the society of the tree why should he who would have me preserve it among men seek to rob me of it i have a you know wealth of my own and i covet not that of other my taste be for freedom and i have no relish for constraint i neither love nor hate anyone i do not deceive this one or court that or trifle with one or play with another the modest converse of the shepherd girl of these hamlet and the care of my goat be my recreation my desire be bound by these mountain and if they ever wander hence it be to contemplate the beauty of the heaven step by which the soul travel to it primeval abode with these word and not wait to hear a reply she turn and pass into the thick part of a wood that be hard by leave all who be there lose in admiration a much of her good sense a of her beauty somethose wound by the irresistible shaft launch by her bright eyesmade a though they would follow her heedless of the frank declaration they have hear see which and deem this a fitting occasion for the exercise of hi chivalry in aid of distressed damsel don quixote lay hi hand on the hilt of hi sword exclaim in a loud and distinct voice let no one whatever hi rank or condition dare to follow the beautiful marcela under pain of incur my fierce indignation she have show by clear and satisfactory argument that little or no fault be to be find with her for the death of chrysostom and also how far she be from yield to the wish of any of her lover for which reason instead of be follow and persecute she should in justice be honour and esteem by all the good people of the world for she show that she be the only woman in it that hold to such a virtuous resolution whether it be because of the threat of don quixote or because ambrosio tell them to fulfil their duty to their good friend none of the shepherd move or stir from the spot until have finish the grave and burn chrysostoms paper they lay hi body in it not without many tear from those who stand by they close the grave with a heavy stone until a slab be ready which ambrosio say he mean to have prepare with an epitaph which be to be to this effect beneath the stone before your eye the body of a lover lie in life he be a shepherd swain in death a victim to disdain ungrateful cruel coy and fair wa she that drive him to despair and love hath make her hi ally for spread wide hi tyranny they then strew upon the grave a profusion of flower and branch and all express their condolence with hi friend ambrosio take their vivaldo and hi companion do the same and don quixote bid farewell to hi host and to the traveller who press him to come with them to seville a be such a convenient place for find adventure for they present themselves in every street and round every corner oftener than anywhere els don quixote thank them for their advice and for the disposition they show to do him a favour and say that for the present he would not and must not go to seville until he have clear all these mountain of highwayman and robber of whom report say they be full see hi good intention the traveller be unwilling to press him further and once more bidding him farewell they leave him and pursue their journey in the course of which they do not fail to discuss the story of marcela and chrysostom as well a the madness of don quixote he on hi part resolve to go in quest of the shepherdess marcela and make offer to her of all the service he could render her but thing do not fall out with him a he expect accord to what be relate in the course of this veracious history of which the second part end here chapter xv in which is related the unfortunate adventure that don quixote fell in with when he fell out with certain heartless yanguesans the sage cide hamete benengeli relate that as soon a don quixote take leave of hi host and all who have be present at the burial of chrysostom he and hi squire pass into the same wood which they have see the shepherdess marcela enter and after have wander for more than two hour in all direction in search of her without find her they come to a halt in a glade cover with tender grass beside which run a pleasant cool stream that invite and compel them to pass there the hour of the noontide heat which by this time be begin to come on oppressively don quixote and sancho dismount and turn rocinante and the as loose to fee on the grass that be there in abundance they ransack the alforjas and without any ceremony very peacefully and sociably master and man make their repast on what they find in them sancho have not think it worth while to hobble rocinante feeling sure from what he know of hi staidness and freedom from incontinence that all the mare in the cordova pasture would not lead him into an impropriety chance however and the devil who be not always asleep so ordain it that feed in this valley there be a drove of galician pony belong to certain yanguesan carrier whose way it be to take their midday rest with their team in place and spot where grass and water abound and that where don quixote chance to be suit the yanguesans purpose very well it so happen then that rocinante take a fancy to disport himselfwith their ladyship the pony and abandon hi usual gait and demeanour a he scent them he without ask leave of hi master get up a briskish little trot and hasten to make know hi wish to them they however it seem prefer their pasture to him and receive him with their heel and teeth to such effect that they soon break hi girth and leave him naked without a saddle to cover him but what must have be bad to him be that the carrier see the violence he be offer to their mare come run up arm with stake and so belabour him that they bring him sorely batter to the ground by this time don quixote and sancho who have witness the drubbing of rocinante come up panting and say don quixote to sancho so far a i can see friend sancho these be not knight but base folk of low birth i mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in take due vengeance for the insult offer to rocinante before our eye what the devil vengeance can we take answer sancho if they be more than twenty and we no more than two or indeed perhaps not more than one and a half i count for a hundred replied don quixote and without more word he draw hi sword and attack the yanguesans and excite and impel by the example of hi master sancho do the same and to begin with don quixote deliver a slash at one of them that lay open the leather jerkin he wear together with a great portion of hi shoulder the yanguesans see themselves assault by only two men while they be so many betook themselves to their stake and drive the two into the middle they begin to lay on with great zeal and energy in fact at the second blow they bring sancho to the ground and don quixote fare the same way all hi skill and high mettle avail him nothing and fate will it that he should fall at the foot of rocinante who have not yet rise whereby it may be see how furiously stake can pound in angry boorish hand then see the mischief they have do the yanguesans with all the haste they could load their team and pursue their journey leave the two adventurer a sorry sight and in sorry mood sancho be the first to come to and find himselfclose to hi master he call to him in a weak and doleful voice senor don quixote ah senor don quixote what wouldst thou brother sancho answer don quixote in the same feeble suffer tone a sancho i would like if it be possible answered sancho panza your worship to give me a couple of sup of that potion of the fiery blas if it be that you have any to hand there perhaps it will serve for broken bone as well a for wound if i only have it here wretch that i be what more should we want say don quixote but i swear to thee sancho panza on the faith of a knighterrant ere two day be over unless fortune order otherwise i mean to have it in my possession or my hand will have lose it cunning but in how many do your worship think we shall have the use of our foot answer sancho panza for myself i must say i can not guess how many say the batter knight don quixote but i take all the blame upon myself for i have no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dub knight like myself and so i believe that in punishment for have transgress the law of chivalry the god of battle have permit this chastisement to be administer to me for which reason brother sancho it be well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which i be now about to mention to thee for it be of much importance to the welfare of both of u it be at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offer u insult thou art not to wait till i draw sword against them for i shall not do so at all but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart content and if any knight come to their aid and defence i will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might and thou hast already see by a thousand sign and proof what the might of this strong arm of mine be equal toso uplift have the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout biscayan but sancho do not so fully approve of hi master admonition a to let it pass without say in reply senor i be a man of peace meek and quiet and i can put up with any affront because i have a wife and child to support and bring up so let it be likewise a hint to your worship a it can not be a mandate that on no account will i draw sword either against clown or against knight and that here before god i forgive the insult that have be offer me whether they have be be or shall be offer me by high or low rich or poor noble or commoner not except any rank or condition whatsoever to all which hi master say in reply i wish i have breath enough to speak somewhat easily and that the pain i feel on this side would abate so a to let me explain to thee panza the mistake thou makest come now sinner suppose the wind of fortune hitherto so adverse should turn in our favour fill the sail of our desire so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those island i have promise thee how would it be with thee if on win it i make thee lord of it why thou wilt make it wellnigh impossible through not be a knight nor have any desire to be one nor possess the courage nor the will to avenge insult or defend thy lordship for thou must know that in newly conquer kingdom and provinces the mind of the inhabitant be never so quiet nor so well dispose to the new lord that there be no fear of their make some move to change matter once more and try a they say what chance may do for them so it be essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern and valour to attack and defend himselfwhatever may befall him in what have now befall u answer sancho id have be well pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of but i swear on the faith of a poor man i be more fit for plaster than for argument see if your worship can get up and let u help rocinante though he do not deserve it for he be the main cause of all this thrash i never think it of rocinante for i take him to be a virtuous person and as quiet a myself after all they say right that it take a long time to come to know people and that there be nothing sure in this life who would have say that after such mighty slash a your worship give that unlucky knighterrant there be come travel post and at the very heel of them such a great storm of stick a have fall upon our shoulder and yet thine sancho reply don quixote ought to be use to such squall but mine rear in soft cloth and fine linen it be plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap and if it be not that i imaginewhy do i say imagineknow of a certainty that all these annoyance be very necessary accompaniment of the call of arm i would lay me down here to die of pure vexation to this the squire reply senor a these mishap be what one reaps of chivalry tell me if they happen very often or if they have their own fix time for come to pass because it seem to me that after two harvest we shall be no good for the third unless god in hi infinite mercy help u know friend sancho answer don quixote that the life of knightserrant be subject to a thousand danger and revers and neither more nor less be it within immediate possibility for knightserrant to become king and emperor a experience have show in the case of many different knight with whose history i be thoroughly acquaint and i could tell thee now if the pain would let me of some who simply by might of arm have rise to the high station i have mention and those same both before and after experienced diver misfortune and misery for the valiant amadis of gaul find himselfin the power of hi mortal enemy arcalaus the magician who it be positively asserted hold him captive give him more than two hundred lash with the rein of hi horse while tie to one of the pillar of a court and moreover there be a certain recondite author of no small authority who say that the knight of phoebus be catch in a certain pitfall which open under hi foot in a certain castle on fall find himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground where they administer to him one of those thing they call clyster of sand and snowwater that wellnigh finish him and if he have not be succour in that sore extremity by a sage a great friend of hi it would have go very hard with the poor knight so i may well suffer in company with such worthy folk for great be the indignity which they have to suffer than those which we suffer for i would have thee know sancho that wound cause by any instrument which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity and this be lay down in the law of the duel in express word if for instance the cobbler strike another with the last which he have in hi hand though it be in fact a piece of wood it can not be say for that reason that he whom he strike with it have be cudgel i say this l thou shouldst imagine that because we have be drub in this affray we have therefore suffer any indignity for the arm those men carry with which they pound u be nothing more than their stake and not one of them so far a i remember carry rapier sword or dagger they give me no time to see that much answer sancho for hardly have i lay hand on my tizona when they sign the cross on my shoulder with their stick in such style that they take the sight out of my eye and the strength out of my foot stretch me where i now lie and where thinking of whether all those stakestrokes be an indignity or not give me no uneasiness which the pain of the blow do for they will remain a deeply impress on my memory a on my shoulder for all that let me tell thee brother panza say don quixote that there be no recollection which time do not put an end to and no pain which death do not remove and what great misfortune can there be reply panza than the one that wait for time to put an end to it and death to remove it if our mishap be one of those that be cure with a couple of plaster it would not be so bad but i be begin to think that all the plaster in a hospital almost wont be enough to put u right no more of that pluck strength out of weakness sancho a i mean to do return don quixote and let u see how rocinante be for it seem to me that not the least share of this mishap have fall to the lot of the poor beast there be nothing wonderful in that reply sancho since he be a knighterrant too what i wonder at be that my beast should have come off scotfree where we come out scotch fortune always leave a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it say don quixote i say so because this little beast may now supply the want of rocinante carry me hence to some castle where i may be cure of my wound and moreover i shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted for i remember have read how the good old silenus the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter when he enter the city of the hundred gate go very contentedly mount on a handsome as it may be true that he go mount a your worship say answer sancho but there be a great difference between go mount and go slung like a sack of manure to which don quixote reply wound receive in battle confer honour instead of take it away and so friend panza say no more but a i tell thee before get up as well a thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whatever fashion please thee best and let u go hence ere night come on and surprise u in these wild and yet i have hear your worship say observe panza that it be very meet for knightserrant to sleep in waste and desert and that they esteem it very good fortune that be say don quixote when they can not help it or when they be in love and so true be this that there have be knight who have remain two year on rock in sunshine and shade and all the inclemency of heaven without their lady know anything of it and one of these be amadis when under the name of beltenebros he take up hi abode on the pena pobre fori know not if it be eight year or eight month for i be not very sure of the reckoning at any rate he stay there do penance for i know not what pique the princess oriana have against him but no more of this now sancho and make haste before a mishap like rocinantes befall the as the very devil would be in it in that case say sancho and let off thirty oh and sixty sigh and a hundred and twenty malediction and execration on whomsoever it be that have bring him there he raise himselfstop halfway bent like a turkish bow without power to bring himselfupright but with all hi pain he saddle hi as who too have go astray somewhat yield to the excessive licence of the day he next raise up rocinante and a for him have he possess a tongue to complain with most assuredly neither sancho nor hi master would have be behind him to be brief sancho fix don quixote on the as and secure rocinante with a lead rein and take the as by the halter he proceed more or less in the direction in which it seem to him the high road might be and a chance be conduct their affair for them from good to better he have not go a short league when the road come in sight and on it he perceive an inn which to hi annoyance and to the delight of don quixote must needs be a castle sancho insist that it be an inn and hi master that it be not one but a castle and the dispute last so long that before the point be settle they have time to reach it and into it sancho enter with all hi team without any further controversy chapter xvi of what happened to the ingenious gentleman in the inn which he took to be a castle the innkeeper see don quixote slung across the as ask sancho what be amiss with him sancho answer that it be nothing only that he have fall down from a rock and have hi rib a little bruise the innkeeper have a wife whose disposition be not such a those of her call commonly have for she be by nature kindhearted and felt for the suffering of her neighbour so she at once set about tend don quixote and make her young daughter a very comely girl help her in take care of her guest there be besides in the inn a servant an asturian lass with a broad face flat poll and snub nose blind of one eye and not very sound in the other the elegance of her shape to be sure make up for all her defect she do not measure seven palm from head to foot and her shoulder which overweight her somewhat make her contemplate the ground more than she like this graceful lass then help the young girl and the two make up a very bad bed for don quixote in a garret that show evident sign of have formerly serve for many year a a strawloft in which there be also quarter a carrier whose bed be place a little beyond our don quixotes and though only make of the packsaddle and cloth of hi mule have much the advantage of it a don quixotes consist simply of four rough board on two not very even trestles a mattress that for thinness might have pass for a quilt full of pellet which be they not see through the rent to be wool would to the touch have seem pebble in hardness two sheet make of buckler leather and a coverlet the thread of which anyone that choose might have count without miss one in the reckoning on this accurse bed don quixote stretch himselfand the hostess and her daughter soon cover him with plaster from top to toe while maritornesfor that be the name of the asturianheld the light for them and while plaster him the hostess observe how full of wheal don quixote be in some place remark that this have more the look of blow than of a fall it be not blows sancho say but that the rock have many point and projection and that each of them have leave it mark pray senora he add manage to save some tow a there will be no want of some one to use it for my loin too be rather sore then you must have fall too say the hostess i do not fall say sancho panza but from the shock i get at see my master fall my body ache so that i feel a if i have have a thousand thwack that may well be say the young girl for it have many a time happen to me to dream that i be fall down from a tower and never come to the ground and when i awake from the dream to find myself a weak and shake a if i have really fall there be the point senora reply sancho panza that i without dream at all but be more awake than i be now find myself with scarcely less wheal than my master don quixote how be the gentleman call ask maritornes the asturian don quixote of la mancha answer sancho panza and he be a knightadventurer and one of the best and stout that have be see in the world this long time past what be a knightadventurer say the lass are you so new in the world a not to know answered sancho panza well then you must know sister that a knightadventurer be a thing that in two word be see drubbed and emperor that be today the most miserable and needy be in the world and tomorrow will have two or three crown of kingdom to give hi squire then how be it say the hostess that belong to so good a master a this you have not to judge by appearance even so much a a county it be too soon yet answer sancho for we have only be a month go in quest of adventure and so far we have meet with nothing that can be call one for it will happen that when one thing be look for another thing be find however if my master don quixote get well of this wound or fall and i be left none the bad of it i would not change my hope for the best title in spain to all this conversation don quixote be listen very attentively and sit up in bed as well a he could and take the hostess by the hand he say to her believe me fair lady you may call yourself fortunate in have in this castle of yours shelter my person which be such that if i do not myself praise it it be because of what be commonly say that selfpraise debaseth but my squire will inform you who i be i only tell you that i shall preserve for ever inscribe on my memory the service you have render me in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall last me and would to heaven love hold me not so enthralled and subject to it law and to the eye of that fair ingrate whom i name between my teeth but that those of this lovely damsel might be the master of my liberty the hostess her daughter and the worthy maritornes listen in bewilderment to the word of the knighterrant for they understand about as much of them a if he have be talk greek though they could perceive they be all meant for expression of goodwill and blandishment and not be accustom to this kind of language they star at him and wonder to themselves for he seem to them a man of a different sort from those they be use to and thank him in pothouse phrase for hi civility they leave him while the asturian give her attention to sancho who need it no less than hi master the carrier have make an arrangement with her for recreation that night and she have give him her word that when the guest be quiet and the family asleep she would come in search of him and meet hi wish unreservedly and it be say of this good lass that she never make promise of the kind without fulfil them even though she make them in a forest and without any witness present for she plume herself greatly on be a lady and hold it no disgrace to be in such an employment a servant in an inn because she say misfortune and illluck have bring her to that position the hard narrow wretched rickety bed of don quixote stand first in the middle of this starlit stable and close beside it sancho make hi which merely consist of a rush mat and a blanket that look a if it be of threadbare canvas rather than of wool next to these two bed be that of the carrier make up a have be say of the packsaddle and all the trapping of the two best mule he have though there be twelve of them sleek plump and in prime condition for he be one of the rich carrier of arevalo accord to the author of this history who particularly mention this carrier because he know him very well and they even say be in some degree a relation of hi besides which cide hamete benengeli be a historian of great research and accuracy in all thing a be very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that have be already mention however trifle and insignificant they might be an example that might be follow by those grave historian who relate transaction so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them all the substance of the work be leave in the inkstand from carelessness perverseness or ignorance a thousand blessing on the author of tablante de ricamonte and that of the other book in which the deed of the conde tomillas be recount with what minuteness they describe everything to proceed then after have pay a visit to hi team and give them their second feed the carrier stretch himselfon hi packsaddle and lay wait for hi conscientious maritornes sancho be by this time plaster and have lie down and though he strive to sleep the pain of hi rib would not let him while don quixote with the pain of hi have hi eye a wide open a a hare the inn be all in silence and in the whole of it there be no light except that give by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway this strange stillness and the thought always present to our knight mind of the incident describe at every turn in the book that be the cause of hi misfortune conjure up to hi imagination a extraordinary a delusion a can well be conceive which be that he fancy himselfto have reach a famous castle for as have be say all the inn he lodge in be castle to hi eye and that the daughter of the innkeeper be daughter of the lord of the castle and that she win by hi highbred bearing have fall in love with him and have promise to come to hi bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her parent and hold all this fantasy that he have construct a solid fact he begin to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which hi virtue be about to encounter and he resolve in hi heart to commit no treason to hi lady dulcinea del toboso even though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present themselves before him while he be take up with these vagary then the time and the houran unlucky one for himarrived for the asturian to come who in her smock with bare foot and her hair gather into a fustian coif with noiseless and cautious step enter the chamber where the three be quarter in quest of the carrier but scarcely have she gain the door when don quixote perceive her and sit up in hi bed in spite of hi plaster and the pain of hi rib he stretch out hi arm to receive hi beauteous damsel the asturian who go all double up and in silence with her hand before her feeling for her lover encounter the arm of don quixote who grasp her tightly by the wrist and draw her towards him while she dare not utter a word make her sit down on the bed he then felt her smock and although it be of sackcloth it appear to him to be of the fine and soft silk on her wrist she wear some glass bead but to him they have the sheen of precious orient pearl her hair which in some measure resemble a horse mane he rat a thread of the bright gold of araby whose refulgence dim the sun himselfher breath which no doubt smelt of yesterday stale salad seem to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth and in short he draw her portrait in hi imagination with the same feature and in the same style a that which he have see in hi book of the other princess who smite by love come with all the adornment that be here set down to see the sorely wounded knight and so great be the poor gentleman blindness that neither touch nor smell nor anything els about the good lass that would have make any but a carrier vomit be enough to undeceive him on the contrary he be persuade he have the goddess of beauty in hi arm and hold her firmly in hi grasp he go on to say in low tender voice would that find myself lovely and exalt lady in a position to repay such a favour a that which you by the sight of your great beauty have grant me but fortune which be never weary of persecute the good have choose to place me upon this bed where i lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it be impossible besides to this impossibility another yet great be to be add which be the faith that i have pledge to the peerless dulcinea del toboso sole lady of my most secret thought and be it not that this stood in the way i should not be so insensible a knight a to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness have offer me maritornes be fret and sweat at find herself hold so fast by don quixote and not understanding or heed the word he address to her she strive without speak to free herself the worthy carrier whose unholy thought keep him awake be aware of hi doxy the moment she enter the door and be listen attentively to all don quixote say and jealous that the asturian should have break her word with him for another drew nearer to don quixotes bed and stand still to see what would come of this talk which he could not understand but when he perceive the wench struggle to get free and don quixote strive to hold her not relish the joke he raise hi arm and deliver such a terrible cuff on the lank jaw of the amorous knight that he bath all hi mouth in blood and not content with this he mount on hi rib and with hi foot tramp all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot the bed which be somewhat crazy and not very firm on it foot unable to support the additional weight of the carrier come to the ground and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once conclude that it must be some brawl of maritornes because after call loudly to her he get no answer with this suspicion he get up and light a lamp hasten to the quarter where he have hear the disturbance the wench see that her master be come and know that hi temper be terrible frightened and panicstricken make for the bed of sancho panza who still sleep and crouch upon it make a ball of herself the innkeeper come in exclaim where art thou strumpet of course this be some of thy work at this sancho awoke and feeling this mass almost on top of him fancy he have the nightmare and begin to distribute fisticuffs all round of which a certain share fell upon maritornes who irritate by the pain and fling modesty aside pay back so many in return to sancho that she wake him up in spite of himselfhe then find himselfso handle by whom he know not raise himselfup as well a he could grapple with maritornes and he and she between them begin the bitter and droll scrimmage in the world the carrier however perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fare with hi ladylove quit don quixote run to bring her the help she need and the innkeeper do the same but with a different intention for hi be to chastise the lass a he believe that beyond a doubt she alone be the cause of all the harmony and so a the saying be cat to rat rat to rope rope to stick the carrier pound sancho sancho the lass she him and the innkeeper her and all work away so briskly that they do not give themselves a moment rest and the best of it be that the innkeeper lamp go out and a they be leave in the dark they all lay on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there be not a sound spot leave where a hand could light it so happen that there be lodge that night in the inn a caudrillero of what they call the old holy brotherhood of toledo who also hear the extraordinary noise of the conflict seize hi staff and the tin case with hi warrant and make hi way in the dark into the room cry hold in the name of the jurisdiction hold in the name of the holy brotherhood the first that he come upon be the pummelled don quixote who lay stretch senseless on hi back upon hi brokendown bed and hi hand fall on the beard a he felt about he continue to cry help for the jurisdiction but perceive that he whom he have lay hold of do not move or stir he conclude that he be dead and that those in the room be hi murderer and with this suspicion he raise hi voice still higher call out shut the inn gate see that no one go out they have kill a man here this cry startle them all and each drop the contest at the point at which the voice reach him the innkeeper retreat to hi room the carrier to hi packsaddle the lass to her crib the unlucky don quixote and sancho alone be unable to move from where they be the cuadrillero on this let go don quixotes beard and go out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprit but not find one a the innkeeper have purposely extinguish the lantern on retreat to hi room he be compel to have recourse to the hearth where after much time and trouble he light another lamp chapter xvii in which are contained the innumerable trouble which the brave don quixote and hi good squire sancho panza endured in the inn which to hi misfortune he took to be a castle by this time don quixote have recover from hi swoon and in the same tone of voice in which he have call to hi squire the day before when he lay stretch in the vale of the stake he begin call to him now sancho my friend art thou asleep sleepest thou friend sancho how can i sleep curse on it return sancho discontentedly and bitterly when it be plain that all the devil have be at me this night thou mayest well believe that answered don quixote because either i know little or this castle be enchant for thou must knowbut this that i be now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death i swear it answer sancho i say so continued don quixote because i hate take away anyones good name i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship day and god grant i may be able to let it out tomorrow do i do thee such injury sancho say don quixote that thou wouldst see me dead so soon it be not for that reply sancho but because i hate keep thing long and i dont want them to grow rotten with me from overkeeping at any rate say don quixote i have more confidence in thy affection and good nature and so i would have thee know that this night there befall me one of the strange adventure that i could describe and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the daughter of the lord of this castle come to me and that she be the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be find in the wide world what i could tell thee of the charm of her person of her lively wit of other secret matter which to preserve the fealty i owe to my lady dulcinea del toboso i shall pass over unnoticed and in silence i will only tell thee that either fate be envious of so great a boon place in my hand by good fortune or perhaps and this be more probable this castle be a i have already say enchant at the time when i be engage in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her there come without my seeing or know whence it come a hand attach to some arm of some huge giant that plant such a cuff on my jaw that i have them all bath in blood and then pummel me in such a way that i be in a bad plight than yesterday when the carrier on account of rocinantes misbehaviour inflict on u the injury thou knowest of whence conjecture that there must be some enchanted moor guard the treasure of this damsel beauty and that it be not for me not for me either say sancho for more than four hundred moor have so thrash me that the drubbing of the stake be cake and fancybread to it but tell me senor what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that have leave u a we be leave now though your worship be not so badly off have in your arm that incomparable beauty you speak of but i what do i have except the heavy whack i think i have in all my life unlucky me and the mother that bore me for i be not a knighterrant and never expect to be one and of all the mishap the great part fall to my share then thou hast be thrash too say don quixote didnt i say so bad luck to my line say sancho be not distress friend say don quixote for i will now make the precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye by this time the cuadrillero have succeed in light the lamp and come in to see the man that he think have be kill and a sancho catch sight of him at the door see him come in hi shirt with a cloth on hi head and a lamp in hi hand and a very forbidding countenance he say to hi master senor can it be that this be the enchanted moor come back to give u more castigation if there be anything still leave in the inkbottle it can not be the moor answer don quixote for those under enchantment do not let themselves be see by anyone if they dont let themselves be see they let themselves be felt say sancho if not let my shoulder speak to the point mine could speak too say don quixote but that be not a sufficient reason for believe that what we see be the enchanted moor the officer come up and find them engage in such a peaceful conversation stand amaze though don quixote to be sure still lay on hi back unable to move from pure pummelling and plaster the officer turn to him and say well how go it good man i would speak more politely if i be you reply don quixote be it the way of this country to address knightserrant in that style you booby the cuadrillero find himselfso disrespectfully treat by such a sorrylooking individual lose hi temper and raise the lamp full of oil smote don quixote such a blow with it on the head that he give him a badly broken pate then all be in darkness he go out and sancho panza say that be certainly the enchanted moor senor and he keep the treasure for other and for u only the cuff and lampwhacks that be the truth answer don quixote and there be no use in trouble oneself about these matter of enchantment or be angry or vex at them for a they be invisible and visionary we shall find no one on whom to avenge ourselves do what we may rise sancho if thou canst and call the alcaide of this fortress and get him to give me a little oil wine salt and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam for indeed i believe i have great need of it now because i be lose much blood from the wound that phantom give me sancho get up with pain enough in hi bone and go after the innkeeper in the dark and meet the officer who be look to see what have become of hi enemy he say to him senor whoever you be do u the favour and kindness to give u a little rosemary oil salt and wine for it be want to cure one of the best knightserrant on earth who lie on yonder bed wound by the hand of the enchanted moor that be in this inn when the officer hear him talk in this way he take him for a man out of hi sens and a day be now begin to break he open the inn gate and call the host he tell him what this good man want the host furnish him with what he require and sancho bring it to don quixote who with hi hand to hi head be bewail the pain of the blow of the lamp which have do him no more harm than raise a couple of rather large lump and what he fancy blood be only the sweat that flow from him in hi suffering during the late storm to be brief he take the material of which he make a compound mix them all and boil them a good while until it seem to him they have come to perfection he then ask for some vial to pour it into and a there be not one in the inn he decide on put it into a tin oilbottle or flask of which the host make him a free gift and over the flask he repeat more than eighty paternoster and a many more avemarias salve and credos accompany each word with a cross by way of benediction at all which there be present sancho the innkeeper and the cuadrillero for the carrier be now peacefully engage in attend to the comfort of hi mule this be accomplish he felt anxious to make trial himselfon the spot of the virtue of this precious balsam a he consider it and so he drink near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remain in the pigskin in which it have be boil but scarcely have he do drinking when he begin to vomit in such a way that nothing be leave in hi stomach and with the pang and spasm of vomit he break into a profuse sweat on account of which he bid them cover him up and leave him alone they do so and he lay sleep more than three hour at the end of which he awake and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from hi bruise that he think himselfquite cure and verily believe he have hit upon the balsam of fierabras and that with this remedy he might thenceforward without any fear face any kind of destruction battle or combat however perilous it might be sancho panza who also regard the amendment of hi master a miraculous beg him to give him what be leave in the pigskin which be no small quantity don quixote consent and he take it with both hand in good faith and with a good will gulp down and drain off very little less than hi master but the fact be that the stomach of poor sancho be of necessity not so delicate a that of hi master and so before vomit he be seize with such griping and retchings and such sweat and faintness that verily and truly he believe hi last hour have come and find himselfso rack and torment he curse the balsam and the thief that have give it to him don quixote see him in this state say it be my belief sancho that this mischief come of thy not be dub a knight for i be persuade this liquor can not be good for those who be not so if your worship know that return sanchowoe betide me and all my kindredwhy do you let me taste it at this moment the draught take effect and the poor squire begin to discharge both way at such a rate that the rush mat on which he have throw himselfand the canvas blanket he have cover him be fit for nothing afterwards he sweat and perspire with such paroxysm and convulsion that not only he himselfbut all present think hi end have come this tempest and tribulation last about two hour at the end of which he be leave not like hi master but so weak and exhaust that he could not stand don quixote however who a have be say felt himselfrelieve and well be eager to take hi departure at once in quest of adventure a it seem to him that all the time he loiter there be a fraud upon the world and those in it who stand in need of hi help and protection all the more when he have the security and confidence hi balsam afford him and so urge by this impulse he saddle rocinante himselfand put the packsaddle on hi squire beast whom likewise he help to dress and mount the as after which he mount hi horse and turn to a corner of the inn he lay hold of a pike that stand there to serve him by way of a lance all that be in the inn who be more than twenty person stand watch him the innkeeper daughter be likewise observe him and he too never take hi eye off her and from time to time fetch a sigh that he seem to pluck up from the depth of hi bowel but they all think it must be from the pain he felt in hi rib at any rate they who have see him plaster the night before thought so as soon a they be both mount at the gate of the inn he call to the host and say in a very grave and measured voice many and great be the favour senor alcaide that i have receive in this castle of yours and i remain under the deep obligation to be grateful to you for them all the day of my life if i can repay them in avenge you of any arrogant foe who may have wrong you know that my call be no other than to aid the weak to avenge those who suffer wrong and to chastise perfidy search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood which i have receive to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire the innkeeper reply to him with equal calmness sir knight i do not want your worship to avenge me of any wrong because when any be do me i can take what vengeance seem good to me the only thing i want be that you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night as well for the straw and barley for your two beast a for supper and bed then this be an inn say don quixote and a very respectable one say the innkeeper i have be under a mistake all this time answer don quixote for in truth i think it be a castle and not a bad one but since it appear that it be not a castle but an inn all that can be do now be that you should excuse the payment for i can not contravene the rule of knightserrant of whom i know a a fact and up to the present i have read nothing to the contrary that they never pay for lodging or anything els in the inn where they might be for any hospitality that might be offer them be their due by law and right in return for the insufferable toil they endure in seek adventure by night and by day in summer and in winter on foot and on horseback in hunger and thirst cold and heat expose to all the inclemency of heaven and all the hardship of earth i have little to do with that reply the innkeeper pay me what you owe me and let u have no more talk of chivalry for all i care about be to get my money you be a stupid scurvy innkeeper say don quixote and put spur to rocinante and bring hi pike to the slope he ride out of the inn before anyone could stop him and push on some distance without look to see if hi squire be follow him the innkeeper when he saw him go without pay him run to get payment of sancho who say that a hi master would not pay neither would he because be a he be squire to a knighterrant the same rule and reason hold good for him a for hi master with regard to not pay anything in inn and hostelry at this the innkeeper waxed very wroth and threatened if he do not pay to compel him in a way that he would not like to which sancho make answer that by the law of chivalry hi master have receive he would not pay a rap though it cost him hi life for the excellent and ancient usage of knightserrant be not go to be violate by him nor should the squire of such a be yet to come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him with break so just a privilege the illluck of the unfortunate sancho so order it that among the company in the inn there be four woolcarders from segovia three needlemakers from the colt of cordova and two lodger from the fair of seville lively fellows tenderhearted fond of a joke and playful who almost a if instigate and move by a common impulse make up to sancho and dismount him from hi as while one of them go in for the blanket of the host bed but on fling him into it they look up and see that the ceiling be somewhat low than what they require for their work they decide upon go out into the yard which be bound by the sky and there put sancho in the middle of the blanket they begin to raise him high make sport with him a they would with a dog at shrovetide the cry of the poor blanket wretch be so loud that they reach the ear of hi master who halt to listen attentively be persuade that some new adventure be come until he clearly perceive that it be hi squire who utter them wheel about he come up to the inn with a laborious gallop and find it shut go round it to see if he could find some way of get in but as soon a he come to the wall of the yard which be not very high he discover the game that be be play with hi squire he saw him rise and fall in the air with such grace and nimbleness that have hi rage allow him it be my belief he would have laugh he try to climb from hi horse on to the top of the wall but he be so bruised and batter that he could not even dismount and so from the back of hi horse he begin to utter such malediction and objurgation against those who be blanket sancho a it would be impossible to write down accurately they however do not stay their laughter or their work for this nor do the fly sancho cease hi lamentation mingle now with threat now with entreaty but all to little purpose or none at all until from pure weariness they leave off they then bring him hi as and mount him on top of it they put hi jacket round him and the compassionate maritornes see him so exhaust thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water and that it might be all the cooler she fetch it from the well sancho take it and a he be raise it to hi mouth he be stop by the cry of hi master exclaim sancho my son drink not water drink it not my son for it will kill thee see here i have the bless balsam and he hold up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drop of it thou wilt certainly be restore at these word sancho turn hi eye asquint and in a still loud voice say can it be your worship have forget that i be not a knight or do you want me to end by vomit up what bowel i have leave after last night keep your liquor in the name of all the devil and leave me to myself and at one and the same instant he leave off talk and begin drink but a at the first sup he perceive it be water he do not care to go on with it and beg maritornes to fetch him some wine which she do with right good will and pay for it with her own money for indeed they say of her that though she be in that line of life there be some faint and distant resemblance to a christian about her when sancho have do drinking he dig hi heel into hi as and the gate of the inn be thrown open he pass out very well please at have pay nothing and carry hi point though it have be at the expense of hi usual surety hi shoulder it be true that the innkeeper detain hi alforjas in payment of what be owe to him but sancho take hi departure in such a flurry that he never miss them the innkeeper as soon a he saw him off want to bar the gate close but the blanket would not agree to it for they be fellow who would not have care two farthing for don quixote even have he be really one of the knightserrant of the round table chapter xviii in which is related the discourse sancho panza held with hi master don quixote and other adventure worth relating sancho reach hi master so limp and faint that he could not urge on hi beast when don quixote saw the state he be in he say i have now come to the conclusion good sancho that this castle or inn be beyond a doubt enchant because those who have so atrociously divert themselves with thee what can they be but phantom or being of another world and i hold this confirm by have notice that when i be by the wall of the yard witness the act of thy sad tragedy it be out of my power to mount upon it nor could i even dismount from rocinante because they no doubt have me enchant for i swear to thee by the faith of what i be that if i have be able to climb up or dismount i would have avenge thee in such a way that those braggart thief would have remember their freak for ever even though in so do i know that i contravene the law of chivalry which a i have often tell thee do not permit a knight to lay hand on him who be not one save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of hi own life and person i would have avenge myself too if i could say sancho whether i have be dub knight or not but i could not though for my part i be persuade those who amuse themselves with me be not phantom or enchant men a your worship say but men of flesh and bone like ourselves and they all have their name for i hear them name them when they be toss me and one be call pedro martinez and another tenorio hernandez and the innkeeper i hear be call juan palomeque the lefthanded so that senor your not be able to leap over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse come of something els besides enchantment and what i make out clearly from all this be that these adventure we go seek will in the end lead u into such misadventure that we shall not know which be our right foot and that the best and wise thing accord to my small wit would be for u to return home now that it be harvesttime and attend to our business and give over wander from zeca to mecca and from pail to bucket a the say be how little thou knowest about chivalry sancho reply don quixote hold thy peace and have patience the day will come when thou shalt see with thine own eye what an honourable thing it be to wander in the pursuit of this call nay tell me what great pleasure can there be in the world or what delight can equal that of win a battle and triumphing over one enemy none beyond all doubt very likely answer sancho though i do not know it all i know be that since we have be knightserrant or since your worship have be one for i have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number we have never win any battle except the one with the biscayan and even out of that your worship come with half an ear and half a helmet the less and from that till now it have be all cudgel and more cudgel cuff and more cuff i get the blanketing over and above and fall in with enchanted person on whom i can not avenge myself so a to know what the delight a your worship call it of conquer an enemy be like that be what vexes me and what ought to vex thee sancho reply don quixote but henceforward i will endeavour to have at hand some sword make by such craft that no kind of enchantment can take effect upon him who carry it and it be even possible that fortune may procure for me that which belong to amadis when he be call the knight of the burning sword which be one of the best sword that ever knight in the world possess for besides have the say virtue it cut like a razor and there be no armour however strong and enchant it might be that could resist it such be my luck say sancho that even if that happen and your worship find some such sword it would like the balsam turn out serviceable and good for dubbed knight only and a for the squire they might sup sorrow fear not that sancho say don quixote heaven will deal good by thee thus talk don quixote and hi squire be go along when on the road they be follow don quixote perceive approach them a large and thick cloud of dust on see which he turn to sancho and say this be the day sancho on which will be see the boon my fortune be reserve for me this i say be the day on which as much a on any other shall be display the might of my arm and on which i shall do deed that shall remain write in the book of fame for all age to come seest thou that cloud of dust which rise yonder well then all that be churn up by a vast army compose of various and countless nation that come march there accord to that there must be two say sancho for on this opposite side also there rise just such another cloud of dust don quixote turn to look and find that it be true and rejoice exceedingly he conclude that they be two army about to engage and encounter in the midst of that broad plain for at all time and season hi fancy be full of the battle enchantment adventure crazy feat love and defiance that be record in the book of chivalry and everything he say thought or do have reference to such thing now the cloud of dust he have see be raise by two great drove of sheep come along the same road in opposite direction which because of the dust do not become visible until they draw near but don quixote assert so positively that they be army that sancho be lead to believe it and say well and what be we to do senor what say don quixote give aid and assistance to the weak and those who need it and thou must know sancho that this which come opposite to u be conduct and lead by the mighty emperor alifanfaron lord of the great isle of trapobana this other that march behind me be that of hi enemy the king of the garamantas pentapolin of the bare arm for he always go into battle with hi right arm bare but why be these two lord such enemy they be at enmity reply don quixote because this alifanfaron be a furious pagan and be in love with the daughter of pentapolin who be a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady and a christian and her father be unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandon the religion of hi false prophet mahomet and adopt hi own by my beard say sancho but pentapolin do quite right and i will help him as much a i can in that thou wilt do what be thy duty sancho say don quixote for to engage in battle of this sort it be not requisite to be a dubbed knight that i can well understand answered sancho but where shall we put this as where we may be sure to find him after the fray be over for i believe it have not be the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of this kind that be true say don quixote and what you have best do with him be to leave him to take hi chance whether he be lose or not for the horse we shall have when we come out victor will be so many that even rocinante will run a risk of be change for another but attend to me and observe for i wish to give thee some account of the chief knight who accompany these two army and that thou mayest the good see and mark let u withdraw to that hillock which rise yonder whence both army may be see they do so and place themselves on a rise ground from which the two drove that don quixote make army of might have be plainly see if the cloud of dust they raise have not obscure them and blind the sight nevertheless see in hi imagination what he do not see and what do not exist he begin thus in a loud voice that knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour who bear upon hi shield a lion crown crouch at the foot of a damsel be the valiant laurcalco lord of the silver bridge that one in armour with flower of gold who bear on hi shield three crown argent on an azure field be the dreaded micocolembo grand duke of quirocia that other of gigantic frame on hi right hand be the ever dauntless brandabarbaran de boliche lord of the three arabia who for armour wear that serpent skin and have for shield a gate which accord to tradition be one of those of the temple that samson bring to the ground when by hi death he revenge himselfupon hi enemy but turn thine eye to the other side and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquish timonel of carcajona prince of new biscay who come in armour with arm quartered azure vert white and yellow and bear on hi shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which say miau which be the beginning of the name of hi lady who accord to report be the peerless miaulina daughter of the duke alfeniquen of the algarve the other who burden and press the loin of that powerful charger and bear arm white a snow and a shield blank and without any device be a novice knight a frenchman by birth pierre papin by name lord of the barony of utrique that other who with ironshod heel strike the flank of that nimble particoloured zebra and for arm bear azure vair be the mighty duke of nerbia espartafilardo del bosque who bear for device on hi shield an asparagus plant with a motto in castilian that say rastrea mi suerte and so he go on name a number of knight of one squadron or the other out of hi imagination and to all he assign offhand their arm colour device and motto carry away by the illusion of hi unheardof craze and without a pause he continue people of diver nation compose this squadron in front here be those that drink of the sweet water of the famous xanthus those that scour the woody massilian plain those that sift the pure fine gold of arabia felix those that enjoy the famed cool bank of the crystal thermodon those that in many and various way divert the stream of the golden pactolus the numidian faithless in their promise the persian renowned in archery the parthian and the medes that fight a they fly the arab that ever shift their dwelling the scythian as cruel a they be fair the ethiopian with pierced lip and an infinity of other nation whose feature i recognise and descry though i can not recall their name in this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal stream of the olivebearing betis those that make smooth their countenance with the water of the ever rich and golden tagus those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of the divine genil those that roam the tartesian plain abound in pasture those that take their pleasure in the elysian meadow of jerez the rich manchegans crown with ruddy ear of corn the wearer of iron old relic of the gothic race those that bathe in the pisuerga renowned for it gentle current those that fee their herd along the spread pasture of the wind guadiana famed for it hidden course those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad pyrenees or the dazzling snow of the lofty apennine in a word as many a all europe include and contain good god what a number of country and nation he name give to each it proper attribute with marvellous readiness brimful and saturate with what he have read in hi lying book sancho panza hung upon hi word without speak and from time to time turn to try if he could see the knight and giant hi master be describe and a he could not make out one of them he say to him senor devil take it if theres a sign of any man you talk of knight or giant in the whole thing maybe it all enchantment like the phantom last night how canst thou say that answer don quixote dost thou not hear the neighing of the steed the braying of the trumpet the roll of the drum i hear nothing but a great bleating of ewe and sheep say sancho which be true for by this time the two flock have come close the fear thou art in sancho say don quixote prevents thee from see or hear correctly for one of the effect of fear be to derange the sens and make thing appear different from what they be if thou art in such fear withdraw to one side and leave me to myself for alone i suffice to bring victory to that side to which i shall give my aid and so say he give rocinante the spur and put the lance in rest shot down the slope like a thunderbolt sancho shout after him cry come back senor don quixote i vow to god they be sheep and ewe you be charge come back unlucky the father that beget me what madness be this look there be no giant nor knight nor cat nor arm nor shield quarter or whole nor vair azure or bedevil what be you about sinner that i be before god but not for all these entreaty do don quixote turn back on the contrary he go on shout out ho knight ye who follow and fight under the banner of the valiant emperor pentapolin of the bare arm follow me all ye shall see how easily i shall give him hi revenge over hi enemy alifanfaron of the trapobana so say he dash into the midst of the squadron of ewe and begin spear them with as much spirit and intrepidity a if he be transfix mortal enemy in earnest the shepherd and drover accompany the flock shout to him to desist see it be no use they ungirt their sling and begin to salute hi ear with stone as big a one fist don quixote give no heed to the stone but let drive right and leave kept say where art thou proud alifanfaron come before me i be a single knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand and make thee yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant pentapolin garamanta here come a sugarplum from the brook that strike him on the side and bury a couple of rib in hi body feel himselfso smitten he imagine himself
